##### <a id="3AA"></a>3AA   State offences that have a federal aspect

Object

          (1A)  The object of this section is to identify State offences that have a federal aspect because:

                     (a)  they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the elements of the State offence; or

                     (b)  they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the circumstances in which the State offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be acts or omissions involved in committing the offence); or

                     (c)  the Australian Federal Police investigating them is incidental to the Australian Federal Police investigating an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory.

State offences that have a federal aspect

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a State offence has a **_federal aspect_** if, and only if:

                     (a)  both:

                              (i)  the State offence is not an ancillary offence; and

                             (ii)  assuming that the provision creating the State offence had been enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth instead of by the Parliament of the State—the provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  both:

                              (i)  the State offence is an ancillary offence that relates to a particular primary offence; and

                             (ii)  assuming that the provision creating the primary offence had been enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth instead of by the Parliament of the State—the provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (c)  assuming that the Parliament of the Commonwealth had enacted a provision that created an offence penalising the specific acts or omissions involved in committing the State offence—that provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (d)  both:

                              (i)  the Australian Federal Police is investigating an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory; and

                             (ii)  if the Australian Federal Police is investigating, or were to investigate, the State offence—that investigation is, or would be, incidental to the investigation mentioned in subparagraph (i).

Specificity of acts or omissions

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the specificity of the acts or omissions involved in committing a State offence is to be determined having regard to the circumstances in which the offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be elements of the offence).

State offences covered by paragraph (1)(c)

             (3)  A State offence is taken to be covered by paragraph (1)(c) if the conduct constituting the State offence:

                     (a)  affects the interests of:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth; or

                             (ii)  an authority of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  was engaged in by a constitutional corporation; or

                     (c)  was engaged in in a Commonwealth place; or

                     (d)  involved the use of a postal service or other like service; or

                     (e)  involved an electronic communication; or

                      (f)  involved trade or commerce:

                              (i)  between Australia and places outside Australia; or

                             (ii)  among the States; or

                            (iii)  within a Territory, between a State and a Territory or between 2 Territories; or

                     (g)  involved:

                              (i)  banking (other than State banking not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or

                             (ii)  insurance (other than State insurance not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or

                     (h)  relates to a matter outside Australia; or

                      (i)  relates to a matter in respect of which an international agreement to which Australia is a party imposes obligations to which effect could be given by the creation of an offence against the domestic laws of the parties to the agreement; or

                      (j)  relates to a matter that affects the relations between Australia and another country or countries or is otherwise a subject of international concern.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit paragraph (1)(c).

Thing may be moved for examination or processing

             (2)  A thing found at warrant premises, or a thing found during a search under a warrant that is in force in relation to a person, may be moved to another place for examination or processing in order to determine whether it may be seized under a warrant if:

                     (a)  both of the following apply:

                              (i)  it is significantly more practicable to do so having regard to the timeliness and cost of examining or processing the thing at another place and the availability of expert assistance;

                             (ii)  the executing officer or constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the thing contains or constitutes evidential material; or

                     (b)  for a thing found at warrant premises—the occupier of the premises consents in writing; or

                     (e)  must not be conducted on a person who is under 10; and

                      (f)  if the person being searched is at least 10 but under 18, or is incapable of managing his or her affairs:

                              (i)  may only be conducted if the person has been arrested and charged or if a magistrate orders that it be conducted; and

                             (ii)  must be conducted in the presence of a parent or guardian of the person being searched or, if that is not acceptable to the person, in the presence of another person (other than a constable) who is capable of representing the interests of the person and who, as far as is practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the person; and

                     (g)  must not involve a search of a person’s body cavities; and

                     (h)  must not involve the removal of more garments than the constable conducting the search believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to determine whether the person has in his or her possession the item searched for or to establish the person’s involvement in the offence; and

                      (i)  must not involve more visual inspection than the constable believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to establish the person’s involvement in the offence.

             (2)  In deciding whether to make an order referred to in paragraph (1)(f), the magistrate must have regard to:

                     (a)  the seriousness of the offence; and

##### <a id="3ZM"></a>3ZM  Identification parades

             (1)  This section applies to identification parades held in relation to offences.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3) and to section 3ZN, an identification parade:

                     (a)  may be held if the suspect agrees; or

                     (b)  must be held if:

                              (i)  the suspect has requested that an identification parade be held; and

                             (ii)  it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so.

          (2A)  Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account in determining whether it is reasonable in the circumstances to hold an identification parade, the following must be taken into account:

                     (a)  the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned;

                     (b)  the likely importance in the circumstances of the evidence of identification;

                     (c)  the practicality of holding an identification parade, having regard, among other things:

                              (i)  if the suspect fails to cooperate in the conduct of the parade—to the manner and extent of, and the reason (if any) for, the failure; and

                             (ii)  in any case—to whether an identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence; and

                     (d)  the appropriateness of holding an identification parade, having regard, among other things, to the relationship (if any) between the suspect and the person who may make an identification at the identification parade.

             (3)  An identification parade must not be held unless the suspect has been informed that:

                     (a)  he or she is entitled to refuse to take part in the parade; and

                     (b)  if he or she refuses to take part in the parade:

                              (i)  evidence of the refusal may be given in later proceedings relating to an offence, for the purpose of explaining why an identification parade was not held; and

                             (ii)  evidence may be given in such proceedings of any identification of the suspect by a witness as a result of having seen a photograph or having seen the suspect otherwise than during an identification parade; and

                     (c)  in addition to any requirement under section 3ZN, a legal representative or other person of the suspect’s choice may be present while the person is deciding whether to take part in the parade, and during the holding of the parade, if arrangements for that person to be present can be made within a reasonable time.

             (4)  The giving of the information referred to in subsection (3) must be recorded by a video recording or an audio recording.

             (5)  An identification parade must be arranged and conducted in a manner that will not unfairly prejudice the suspect.

             (6)  Without limiting the intent of subsection (5), an identification parade must be arranged and conducted in accordance with the following rules:

                     (a)  the parade must consist of at least 9 persons;

                     (b)  each of the persons who is not the suspect must:

                              (i)  resemble the suspect in age, height and general appearance; and

                             (ii)  not have features that will be visible during the parade that are markedly different from those of the suspect as described by the witness before viewing the parade;

                     (c)  unless it is impracticable for another constable to arrange or conduct the parade, no constable who has taken part in the investigation relating to the offence may take part in the arrangements for, or the conduct of, the parade;

                     (d)  no person in the parade is to be dressed in a way that would obviously distinguish him or her from the other participants;

                     (e)  if it is practicable to do so, numbers should be placed next to each participant in order to allow the witness to make an identification by indicating the number of the person identified;

                      (f)  the parade may take place so that the witness can view the parade without being seen if the witness requests that it take place in such a manner and:

                              (i)  a legal representative or other person of the suspect’s choice is present with the witness; or

                             (ii)  the parade is recorded by a video recording;

                     (g)  nothing is to be done that suggests or is likely to suggest to a witness which member of the parade is the suspect;

                     (h)  if the witness so requests, members of the parade may be required to speak, move or adopt a specified posture but, if this happens, the witness must be reminded that the members of the parade have been chosen on the basis of physical appearance only;

                      (i)  the suspect may select where he or she wishes to stand in the parade;

                      (j)  if more than one witness is to view the parade:

                              (i)  each witness must view the parade alone; and

                             (ii)  the witnesses are not to communicate with each other at a time after arrangements for the parade have commenced and before each of them has viewed the parade; and

                            (iii)  the suspect may change places in the parade after each viewing;

                     (k)  each witness must be told that:

                              (i)  the suspect may not be in the parade; and

                             (ii)  if he or she is unable to identify the suspect with reasonable certainty he or she must say so;

                      (l)  the parade must be recorded by a video recording if it is practicable to do so and, if that is done, a copy of the video recording must be made available to the suspect or his or her legal representative as soon as it is practicable to do so;

                    (m)  if the parade is not recorded by a video recording:

                              (i)  the parade must be photographed in colour; and

                             (ii)  a print of a photograph of the parade that is at least 250mm ´ 200mm in size must be made available to the suspect or his or her legal representative; and

                            (iii)  the constable in charge of the parade must take all reasonable steps to record everything said and done at the parade and must make a copy of the record available to the suspect or his or her legal representative;

                     (n)  the suspect may have present during the holding of the parade a legal representative or other person of his or her choice if arrangements for that person to be present can be made within a reasonable time.

             (7)  Nothing in this Act affects the determination of the following questions:

                     (a)  whether or not evidence of a suspect having refused to take part in an identification parade is admissible;

                     (b)  if evidence of such a refusal is admissable, what inferences (if any) may be drawn by a court or jury from the refusal;

                     (c)  whether, after such a refusal, evidence of alternative methods of identification is admissible.

             (8)  If a witness is, under the supervision of a constable, to attempt to identify a suspect otherwise than during an identification parade, the constable must ensure that the attempted identification is done in a manner that is fair to the suspect.

##### <a id="3ZN"></a>3ZN  Identification parades for suspects under 18 etc.

             (1)  An identification parade must not be held for a suspect who is under 10.

             (2)  An identification parade must not be held for a suspect who is incapable of managing his or her affairs unless a magistrate orders that it be held.

             (3)  An identification parade must not be held for a suspect who:

                     (a)  is at least 10 but under 18; and

                     (b)  is capable of managing his or her affairs;

unless one of the following paragraphs applies:

                     (c)  the suspect agrees to or requests in writing the holding of the parade and a parent or guardian of the suspect agrees in writing to the holding of the parade or, if the parent or guardian is not acceptable to the suspect, another person (other than a constable) who is capable of representing the interests of the suspect and who, as far as is practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the suspect agrees in writing to the holding of the parade;

                     (d)  if:

                              (i)  one of those persons agrees in writing to the holding of the parade but the other does not; and

                             (ii)  a magistrate orders that the parade be held.

             (4)  In deciding whether to make such an order, the magistrate must have regard to:

                     (a)  the seriousness of the offence; and

                     (b)  the age or any disability of the person; and

                     (c)  such other matters as the magistrate thinks fit.

             (5)  An identification parade for a suspect who is under 18 or is incapable of managing his or her affairs must be held in the presence of:

                     (a)  a parent or guardian of the suspect; or

                     (b)  if the parent or guardian is not acceptable to the suspect, another person (other than a constable) who is capable of representing the interests of the suspect and who, as far as is practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the suspect.

##### <a id="3ZO"></a>3ZO  Identification by means of photographs

             (1)  If a suspect is in custody in respect of an offence or is otherwise available to take part in an identification parade, a constable investigating the offence must not show photographs, or composite pictures or pictures of a similar kind, to a witness for the purpose of establishing, or obtaining evidence of, the identity of the suspect unless:

                     (a)  the suspect has refused to take part in an identification parade; or

                    (aa)  the suspect’s appearance has changed significantly since the offence was committed; or

                     (b)  the holding of an identification parade would be:

                              (i)  unfair to the suspect; or

                             (ii)  unreasonable in the circumstances.

          (1A)  Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account in determining whether it would be unreasonable in the circumstances to hold an identification parade, the following must be taken into account:

                     (a)  the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned;

                     (b)  the likely importance in the circumstances of the evidence of identification;

                     (c)  the practicality of holding an identification parade, having regard, among other things:

                              (i)  if the suspect fails to cooperate in the conduct of the parade—to the manner and extent of, and the reason (if any) for, the failure; and

                             (ii)  in any case—to whether an identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence; and

                     (d)  the appropriateness of holding an identification parade, having regard, among other things, to the relationship (if any) between the suspect and the person who may make an identification at the identification parade.

             (2)  If a constable investigating an offence shows photographs or pictures to a witness for the purpose of establishing, or obtaining evidence of, the identity of a suspect, whether or not the suspect is in custody, the following rules apply:

                     (a)  the constable must show to the witness photographs or pictures of at least 9 different persons;

                     (b)  each photograph or picture of a person who is not the suspect must be of a person who:

                              (i)  resembles the suspect in age and general appearance; and

                             (ii)  does not have features visible in the photograph or picture that are markedly different from those of the suspect as described by the witness before viewing the photographs or pictures;

                   (ba)  the photographs or pictures shown to the witness must not suggest that they are photographs or pictures of persons in police custody;

                     (c)  the constable must not, in doing so, act unfairly towards the suspect or suggest to the witness that a particular photograph or picture is the photograph or picture of the suspect or of a person who is being sought by the police in respect of an offence;

                     (d)  if practicable, the photograph or picture of the suspect must have been taken or made after he or she was arrested or was considered as a suspect;

                     (e)  the witness must be told that a photograph or picture of the suspect may not be amongst those being seen by the witness;

                      (f)  the constable must keep, or cause to be kept, a record identifying each photograph or picture that is shown to the witness;

                     (g)  the constable must notify the suspect or his or her legal representative in writing that a copy of the record is available for the suspect;

                     (h)  the constable must retain the photographs or pictures shown, and must allow the suspect or his or her legal representative, upon application, an opportunity to inspect the photographs or pictures.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a photograph or picture of a person who is suspected in relation to the commission of an offence is shown to a witness; and

                     (b)  the photograph was taken or the picture made after the suspect was arrested or was considered to be a suspect; and

                     (c)  proceedings in relation to the offence referred to in paragraph (a) or another offence arising out of the same course of conduct for which the photograph was taken or picture made are brought against the suspect before a jury; and

                     (d)  the photograph or picture is admitted into evidence;

the jury must be informed that the photograph was taken or the picture made after the suspect was arrested or was considered as a suspect.

             (4)  If a suspect is in custody in respect of an offence, a constable investigating the offence must not show a composite picture or a picture of a similar kind to a witness for the purpose of assisting the witness to describe the features of the suspect.

             (5)  If, after a constable investigating an offence has shown to a witness a composite picture or a picture of a similar kind for the purpose referred to in subsection (4):

                     (a)  a suspect comes into custody in respect of the offence; and

                     (b)  an identification parade is to be held in relation to the suspect;

the constable in charge of the investigation of the offence may, unless doing so would be unfair to the suspect or be unreasonable in the circumstances, request the witness to attend the identification parade and make the necessary arrangements for the witness to attend.

             (6)  If, after the witness has been shown a composite picture or a picture of a similar kind for the purpose referred to in subsection (4), a person is charged with the offence, the constable in charge of investigating the offence must, upon application by that person or his or her legal representative, provide him or her with particulars of any such picture shown to the witness and the comments (if any) of the witness concerning the picture.

             (7)  If a suspect is in custody in respect of an offence and a constable investigating the offence wishes to investigate the possibility that a person other than the suspect committed the offence, subsection (4) does not prevent a constable from taking action referred to in that subsection for the purpose of assisting a witness to describe the features of a person other than the suspect.

##### <a id="3ZP"></a>3ZP  Identification procedures where there is more than one suspect

                   If:

                    (ea)  that the persons giving the requisite consent may withdraw that consent at any time; and

##### <a id="4L"></a>4L  Specified defences not to preclude other defences

                   Where a provision of a law of the Commonwealth provides a defence to a particular offence, the provision does not, unless the contrary intention appears, prevent the use of any defence that is otherwise available.

##### <a id="15AA"></a>15AA  Bail not to be granted in certain cases

             (1)  Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a bail authority must not grant bail to a person (the **_defendant_**) charged with, or convicted of, an offence covered by subsection (2) unless the bail authority is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify bail.

             (2)  This subsection covers:

                     (a)  a terrorism offence (other than an offence against section 102.8 of the _Criminal Code_); and

                     (b)  an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, if:

                              (i)  a physical element of the offence is that the defendant engaged in conduct that caused the death of a person; and

                             (ii)  the fault element for that physical element is that the defendant intentionally engaged in that conduct (whether or not the defendant intended to cause the death, or knew or was reckless as to whether the conduct would result in the death); and

                     (c)  an offence against a provision of Division 80 or Division 91 of the _Criminal Code_, or against section 24AA of this Act, if:

                              (i)  the death of a person is alleged to have been caused by conduct that is a physical element of the offence; or

                             (ii)  conduct that is a physical element of the offence carried a substantial risk of causing the death of a person; and

                     (d)  an ancillary offence against a provision of Division 80 or Division 91 of the _Criminal Code_, or against section 24AA of this Act, if, had the defendant engaged in conduct that is a physical element of the primary offence to which the ancillary offence relates, there would have been a substantial risk that the conduct would have caused the death of a person.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, the express reference in paragraph (2)(d) to an ancillary offence does not imply that references in paragraphs (2)(a), (b) or (c) to an offence do not include references to ancillary offences.

          (3A)  Despite any law of the Commonwealth, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the defendant may appeal against a decision of a bail authority:

                     (a)  to grant bail to a person charged with or convicted of an offence covered by subsection (2) on the basis that the bail authority is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist; or

                     (b)  to refuse to grant bail to a person charged with or convicted of an offence covered by subsection (2) on the basis that the bail authority is not satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist.

          (3B)  An appeal under subsection (3A):

                     (a)  may be made to a court that would ordinarily have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals (however described) from directions, orders or judgments of the bail authority referred to in subsection (3A), whether the jurisdiction is in respect of appeals relating to bail or appeals relating to other matters; and

                     (b)  is to be made in accordance with the rules or procedures (if any) applicable under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory in relation to the exercise of such jurisdiction.

          (3C)  If:

                     (a)  a bail authority decides to grant bail to a person charged with or convicted of an offence covered by subsection (2); and

                     (b)  immediately after the decision is made, the Director of Public Prosecutions notifies the bail authority that he or she intends to appeal against the decision under subsection (3A);

the decision to grant bail is stayed with effect from the time of the notification.

          (3D)  A stay under subsection (3C) ends:

                     (a)  when a decision on the appeal is made; or

                     (b)  when the Director of Public Prosecutions notifies:

                              (i)  the bail authority; or

                             (ii)  if an appeal has already been instituted in a court—the court;

                            that he or she does not intend to proceed with the appeal; or

                     (c)  72 hours after the stay comes into effect;

whichever occurs first.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, except as provided by subsections (1), (3A), (3B), (3C) and (3D), this section does not affect the operation of a law of a State or a Territory.

Note:          These provisions indirectly affect laws of the States and Territories because they affect section 68 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="ancillari-offenc"></a>**_ancillary offence_** has the meaning given in the _Criminal Code_.

                    <a name="primari-offenc"></a>**_primary offence_** has the meaning given in the _Criminal Code_.

##### <a id="15AB"></a>15AB  Matters to be considered in certain bail applications

             (1)  In determining whether to grant bail to a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or in determining conditions to which bail granted to such a person should be subject, a bail authority:

                     (a)  must take into consideration the potential impact of granting bail on:

                              (i)  any person against whom the offence is, or was, alleged to have been committed; and

                             (ii)  any witness, or potential witness, in proceedings relating to the alleged offence, or offence; and

                     (b)  must not take into consideration any form of customary law or cultural practice as a reason for:

                              (i)  excusing, justifying, authorising, requiring or lessening the seriousness of the alleged criminal behaviour to which the alleged offence relates, or the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates; or

                             (ii)  aggravating the seriousness of the alleged criminal behaviour to which the alleged offence relates, or the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates.

             (2)  If a person referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) is living in, or otherwise located in, a remote community, the bail authority must also take into consideration that fact in considering the potential impact of granting bail on that person.

             (3)  In paragraph (1)(b):

                    <a name="crimin-behaviour"></a>**_criminal behaviour_** includes:

                     (a)  any conduct, omission to act, circumstance or result that is, or forms part of, a physical element of the offence in question; and

                     (b)  any fault element relating to such a physical element.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, except as provided by subsections (1) and (2), this section does not affect:

                     (a)  any other matters that a bail authority must, must not or may take into consideration in determining whether to grant bail or in determining conditions to which bail should be subject; or

                     (b)  the operation of a law of a State or a Territory.

Note:          Subsections (1) and (2) indirectly affect laws of the States and Territories because they affect section 68 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_.

##### <a id="15A"></a>15A  Enforcement of fines etc.

             (1)  A law of a State or Territory relating to the enforcement or recovery of a fine imposed on an offender applies to a person convicted in the State or Territory of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. The law applies:

                     (a)  so far as it is not inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  with the modifications (if any) made by or under this section.

       (1AA)  If a law of a State or Territory requires or permits a person or authority other than a court to take action to impose a penalty described in subsection (1AB) for failure to pay a fine, the law applies under subsection (1) as if the law did not require or permit the person or authority to take the action but instead:

                     (a)  allowed any person to apply to a court of summary jurisdiction of the State or Territory for an order imposing the penalty; and

                     (b)  allowed the court to make the order; and

                     (c)  provided for the order to have the same effect that the taking of the action by the person or authority has under the law without the modifications made by or under this subsection; and

                     (d)  were subject to any prescribed modifications consequential on the other modifications described in this subsection, or facilitating the operation of the law with those modifications.

       (1AB)  Subsection (1AA) applies in relation to any of the following penalties:

                     (e)  community service by a person who failed to pay a fine;

                      (f)  detention or imprisonment of a person who failed to pay a fine;

                     (g)  a penalty that is similar to a penalty described in paragraph (e) or (f);

                     (h)  a penalty prescribed by the regulations.

       (1AC)  Jurisdiction is conferred on a court of summary jurisdiction of a State or Territory to make orders described in subsection (1AA).

     (1ACB)  To avoid doubt, if a court makes an order imposing a penalty for failure to pay a fine, whether or not the penalty is described in subsection (1AB), a person or authority other than a court may take action to enforce the penalty without making an application under paragraph (1AA)(a), even if the penalty is imposed as an alternative penalty.

       (1AD)  If a law of a State or Territory requires or permits a court or a court officer to:

                     (a)  refer a matter to a person or organisation; or

                     (b)  notify a person or organisation; or

                     (c)  provide information to a person or organisation;

in relation to the enforcement or recovery of a fine imposed by the court, the law applies under subsection (1) in relation to a federal court in the same way as it applies to a court of the State or Territory.

          (1A)  Where there is a law of a State or Territory with respect to the enforcement or recovery of fines ordered to be paid by offenders (including a law described in subsection (1AA)) that applies in relation to fines ordered to be paid by offenders convicted by courts of summary jurisdiction:

                     (a)  subsection (1) operates to require that law to apply and be applied to persons who are convicted summarily of federal offences by a federal court in the same manner as that law would apply and be applied if the federal court were a court of summary jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  that subsection does not operate in relation to any law of that State or Territory that applies in relation to fines ordered to be paid by offenders convicted by superior courts.

          (1B)  If a law of a State or Territory:

                     (a)  is with respect to the enforcement or recovery of fines ordered to be paid by offenders (including a law described in subsection (1AA)); and

                     (b)  applies in relation to fines ordered to be paid by offenders convicted on indictment;

subsection (1) operates to require that law to apply and be applied in the same manner to persons who are convicted on indictment of federal offences by a federal court.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), in the application to a person convicted of a federal offence of any State or Territory laws with respect to the enforcement or recovery of fines, a requirement that the amount of a fine be paid to a State or Territory office or officer is to be treated as a requirement that the amount of the fine be paid in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  Where a court imposes a sentence or sentences of imprisonment on a person in respect of a failure to pay a fine or fines imposed for a federal offence or offences, the court must direct that the sentence, or all the sentences, commence to be served from the earliest practicable day despite the fact that the person may, on that day, already be serving another sentence of imprisonment for a federal, State or Territory offence.

             (4)  Despite subsection (3), a court may, where it is of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the case, it is more appropriate to do so, direct that a period of imprisonment imposed on a person in respect of a failure to pay a fine imposed in respect of a federal offence commence to be served during, or at the end of, a period of imprisonment imposed for a similar failure in respect of another federal offence.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="feral-offenc"></a>**_federal offence_** means an offence against the law of the Commonwealth.

                    <a name="modif"></a>**_modifications_** includes additions, omissions and substitutions.

##### <a id="15B"></a>15B  Time for commencement of prosecutions

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1B), a prosecution of an individual for an offence against any law of the Commonwealth may be commenced as follows:

                     (a)  if the maximum penalty which may be imposed for the offence in respect of an individual is, or includes, a term of imprisonment of more than 6 months in the case of a first conviction—at any time;

                     (b)  in any other case—at any time within one year after the commission of the offence.

          (1A)  A prosecution of a body corporate for an offence against any law of the Commonwealth may be commenced as follows:

                     (a)  if the maximum penalty which may be imposed for the offence in respect of a body corporate is, or includes, a fine of more than 150 penalty units in the case of a first conviction—at any time;

                     (b)  in any other case—at any time within one year after the commission of the offence.

          (1B)  A prosecution of an individual for an offence that is taken to have been committed because of section 11.2 or 11.2A of the _Criminal Code_, or against another law of the Commonwealth dealing with aiding and abetting, in relation to an offence committed by a body corporate may be commenced as follows:

                     (a)  if the maximum penalty which may be imposed for the principal offence in respect of a body corporate is, or includes, a fine of more than 150 penalty units in the case of a first conviction—at any time;

                     (b)  in any other case—at any time within one year after the commission of the offence by the individual.

             (2)  Notwithstanding any provision in any law of the Commonwealth passed before the commencement of this Act and providing any shorter time for the commencement of the prosecution, any prosecution for an offence against the law may be commenced at any time within one year after the commission of the offence.

             (3)  Where by any law of the Commonwealth any longer time than the time provided by this section is provided for the commencement of a prosecution in respect of an offence against that law, a prosecution in respect of the offence may be commenced at any time within that longer time.

##### <a id="15C"></a>15C  Form of indictments, information and summonses

             (1)  At the hearing of any indictment, information or summons, the court may make such amendment in the indictment, information or summons as appears to it to be desirable or to be necessary to enable the real question in dispute to be determined.

             (2)  If in any such case the court considers that the defendant has been misled by the form in which the indictment, information or summons has been made out, it may adjourn the hearing of the case for such period as it thinks fit and may make such order as to the costs of the adjournment as it thinks proper.

             (3)  The power of the court under subsection (1) shall not be exercised in cases where the court considers that the required amendments cannot be made without injustice to the defendant.

##### <a id="15E"></a>15E  Privilege of Parliament not affected

                   Nothing in this Act shall derogate from any power or privilege of either House of the Parliament or of the members or committees of either House of Parliament as existing at the commencement of this Act.

##### <a id="15F"></a>15F  Civil rights not affected

                   Nothing in this Act shall affect the right of any person aggrieved by any act or omission which is punishable as an offence against this Act to institute civil proceedings in any court in respect of such act or omission.

                     (b)  the Minister, by writing, withdraws the nomination.

             (4)  A nominated Tribunal member has, in relation to the performance or exercise of a function or power conferred on a nominated Tribunal member by this Act, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court has in relation to proceedings in the High Court.

### Division 2—Authorisation of controlled operations

#### Subdivision A—Authorities to conduct controlled operations

##### <a id="15GH"></a>15GH  Applications for authorities to conduct controlled operations

             (1)  An Australian law enforcement officer of a law enforcement agency may apply to an authorising officer for an authority to conduct a controlled operation on behalf of the law enforcement agency.

             (2)  An application for an authority may be made:

                     (a)  by means of a written document signed by the applicant (such an application is a **_formal application_**); or

                     (b)  if the applicant has reason to believe that the delay caused by making a formal application may affect the success of the controlled operation—orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such an application is an **_urgent application_**).

             (3)  Nothing in this Part prevents an application for an authority being made in respect of a controlled operation that has been the subject of a previous application, but in that case the subsequent application must be a formal application.

Note:          An urgent authority can be varied, but not so as to extend its duration—see sections 15GO and 15GS.

             (4)  An application (whether formal or urgent) must:

                     (a)  provide sufficient information to enable the authorising officer to decide whether or not to grant the application; and

                     (b)  state whether or not the proposed controlled operation, or any other controlled operation with respect to the same criminal activity, has been the subject of an earlier application (whether formal or urgent) for an authority or variation of an authority and, if so, whether or not the authority was given or the variation granted; and

                     (c)  state the proposed period of effect of the authority, which must not exceed:

                              (i)  in the case of a formal application—3 months; and

                             (ii)  in the case of an urgent application—7 days.

             (5)  An authorising officer may require an applicant to provide such additional information concerning the proposed controlled operation as is necessary for the proper consideration of the application.

             (6)  As soon as practicable after making an urgent application that was not made in writing, the applicant must make a written record of the application and give a copy of it to the authorising officer to whom the application was made.

##### <a id="15GI"></a>15GI  Determination of applications

             (1)  An authorising officer may, after considering an application for an authority to conduct a controlled operation, and any additional information provided under subsection 15GH(5):

                     (a)  authorise the controlled operation by granting the authority, either unconditionally or subject to conditions; or

                     (b)  refuse the application.

             (2)  An authorising officer must not grant an authority to conduct a controlled operation unless the authorising officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds:

                     (a)  that a serious Commonwealth offence or a serious State offence that has a federal aspect has been, is being or is likely to be, committed; and

                     (b)  that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity are such as to justify the conduct of a controlled operation; and

                     (c)  that any unlawful conduct involved in conducting the controlled operation will be limited to the maximum extent consistent with conducting an effective controlled operation; and

                     (d)  that the operation will be conducted in a way that ensures that, to the maximum extent possible, any illicit goods involved in the controlled operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer at the end of the controlled operation; and

                     (e)  that the proposed controlled conduct will be capable of being accounted for in a way that will enable the reporting requirements of Division 4 to be complied with; and

                      (f)  that the controlled operation will not be conducted in such a way that a person is likely to be induced to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (g)  that any conduct involved in the controlled operation will not:

                              (i)  seriously endanger the health or safety of any person; or

                             (ii)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                            (iii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; or

                            (iv)  result in significant loss of, or serious damage to, property (other than illicit goods); and

                     (h)  that any role assigned to a civilian participant in the operation is not one that could be adequately performed by a law enforcement officer.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, an authorising officer may authorise a particular controlled operation only if he or she is an authorising officer for the controlled operation within the meaning of section 15GF.

             (4)  An authority granted under this section is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="15GJ"></a>15GJ  Manner of granting authority

             (1)  An authority to conduct a controlled operation may be granted:

                     (a)  in the case of a formal application (other than a formal application referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii))—by means of a written document, signed by the authorising officer (such an authority is a **_formal authority_**); or

                     (b)  in the case of:

                              (i)  an urgent application; or

                             (ii)  a formal application, if the authorising officer is satisfied that the delay caused by granting a formal authority may affect the success of the controlled operation;

                            orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such an authority is an **_urgent authority_**).

             (2)  Nothing in this Part prevents an authority being granted in respect of a controlled operation that has been the subject of a previous authority, but in that case the subsequent authority must be a formal authority.

Note:          An urgent authority can be varied, but not so as to extend its duration—see sections 15GO and 15GS.

##### <a id="15GK"></a>15GK  Form of authority

             (1)  A formal authority must:

                     (a)  state the name and rank or position of the person granting the authority; and

                     (b)  identify the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation and, if the principal law enforcement officer is not the applicant for the authority, the name of the applicant; and

                     (c)  state that the application was a formal application; and

                     (d)  identify the nature of the criminal activity (including the suspected serious Commonwealth offences and serious State offences that have a federal aspect) in respect of which the controlled conduct is to be engaged in; and

                     (e)  state the identity of the persons authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; and

                      (f)  specify:

                              (i)  with respect to the law enforcement participants, the nature of the controlled conduct that those participants may engage in; and

                             (ii)  with respect to the civilian participants, the particular controlled conduct (if any) that each such participant may engage in; and

                     (g)  identify (to the extent known) the person or persons targeted; and

                     (h)  specify the period of effect of the authority, being a period not exceeding 3 months; and

                      (i)  specify any conditions to which the conduct of the controlled operation is subject; and

                      (j)  state the date and time when the authority is granted; and

                     (k)  identify the following details (to the extent to which they are known and are relevant):

                              (i)  the nature and quantity of any illicit goods that will be involved in the controlled operation;

                             (ii)  the foreign countries through which those goods are likely to pass in the course of the controlled operation;

                            (iii)  the place or places at which those goods are likely to be dealt with by Customs;

                            (iv)  if subparagraph (iii) does not apply—the place or places where those goods are likely to enter into Australia;

                             (v)  the time or times when, and the day or days on which, those goods are likely to be dealt with by Customs.

             (2)  An urgent authority must:

                     (a)  state the name and rank or position of the person who granted the authority; and

                     (b)  identify the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation and, if the principal law enforcement officer is not the applicant for the authority, the name of the applicant; and

                     (c)  state whether the application was a formal application or an urgent application; and

                     (d)  identify the nature of the criminal activity (including the suspected serious Commonwealth offences and serious State offences that have a federal aspect) in respect of which the controlled conduct is to be engaged in; and

                     (e)  state the identity of the persons authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; and

                      (f)  specify:

                              (i)  with respect to the law enforcement participants, the nature of the controlled conduct that those participants may engage in; and

                             (ii)  with respect to the civilian participants, the particular controlled conduct (if any) that each such participant may engage in; and

                     (g)  identify (to the extent known) the person or persons targeted; and

                     (h)  specify the period of effect of the authority, being a period not exceeding 7 days beginning on the day on which the authority was granted; and

                      (i)  specify any conditions to which the conduct of the operation is subject; and

                      (j)  state the date and time when the authority was granted.

             (3)  A person is sufficiently identified for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e) or (2)(e) if the person is identified:

                     (a)  by an assumed name under which the person is operating; or

                     (b)  by a code name or code number;

as long as the chief officer of the authorising agency for the controlled operation can match the assumed name, code name or code number to the person’s identity.

             (4)  An authority must not identify persons for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e) or (2)(e) by identifying a class of persons.

##### <a id="15GL"></a>15GL  Written record of urgent authority must be issued

                   If an authorising officer grants an urgent authority, the authorising officer must, within 7 days, issue a written record of the urgent authority that complies with subsection 15GK(2) to the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation.

##### <a id="15GM"></a>15GM  Change of principal law enforcement officer

                   If an authorising officer in relation to a controlled operation becomes satisfied that the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation ceases for any reason to have responsibility for the controlled operation:

                     (a)  the authorising officer may, by instrument in writing, nominate another person as the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  with effect from the execution of the instrument or such later time as is specified in the instrument, that other person becomes the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation.

##### <a id="15GN"></a>15GN  Commencement and duration of authorities

             (1)  An authority to conduct a controlled operation comes into force, and the controlled operation is taken to commence, at the time the authority is granted under section 15GI.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, an urgent authority is granted when the authorising officer tells the applicant that the urgent authority is granted.

Note:          An authority is granted under subsection 15GI(1). Paragraph 15GJ(1)(b) enables an authority to be granted orally in specified circumstances.

             (3)  An authority (whether formal or urgent) has effect for the period of effect specified in it under paragraph 15GK(1)(h) or (2)(h) unless:

                     (a)  it is cancelled before the end of the period of effect; or

                     (b)  in the case of a formal authority—the period of effect is extended under Subdivision B or C.

#### Subdivision B—Variation of authorities by appropriate authorising officers

##### <a id="15GO"></a>15GO  Variation of authority by appropriate authorising officer

             (1)  An appropriate authorising officer may vary an authority:

                     (a)  at any time on the authorising officer’s own initiative; or

                     (b)  on application under subsection 15GP(1).

             (2)  A variation may:

                     (a)  extend the period of effect of the authority (subject to subsections (3) and (4)); or

                     (b)  authorise additional persons to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation and specify:

                              (i)  with respect to additional law enforcement participants—the nature of the controlled conduct that those participants may engage in; and

                             (ii)  with respect to additional civilian participants—the particular controlled conduct (if any) that each such participant may engage in; or

                     (c)  provide that specified persons are no longer authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; or

                     (d)  authorise participants in the controlled operation to engage in additional or alternative controlled conduct.

             (3)  A variation cannot be made that has the effect of extending the period of effect of an urgent authority.

             (4)  A formal authority must not be varied in such a way that the period of effect of the authority will, after the variation is made, exceed 3 months (including any previous extensions).

             (5)  An authority must not be varied unless the authorising officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the variation will not authorise a significant alteration of the nature of the controlled operation concerned.

             (6)  A variation is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="15GP"></a>15GP  Application to appropriate authorising officer

             (1)  The principal law enforcement officer for a controlled operation, or any other Australian law enforcement officer acting on behalf of the principal law enforcement officer, may apply under this section to an appropriate authorising officer for a variation of an authority in respect of a matter mentioned in subsection 15GO(2).

             (2)  An application cannot be made under subsection (1) for a variation that would extend the period of effect of a formal authority in such a way that the period of effect of the authority will, after the variation is made, exceed 3 months (including any previous extensions).

             (3)  An application for the variation may be made:

                     (a)  by means of a written document that is signed by the applicant (such an application is a **_formal variation application_**); or

                     (b)  if the applicant has reason to believe that the delay caused by making a formal variation application may affect the success of the controlled operation to which the authority relates—orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such an application is an**_urgent variation application_**).

             (4)  More than one application for a variation under this section may be made in respect of the same authority. However, if an urgent variation of authority was granted as a result of an application under this section, the next application must be a formal variation application.

             (5)  The application (whether a formal variation application or an urgent variation application) must state whether or not the controlled operation has been the subject of an earlier urgent variation application under this section and, if so:

                     (a)  whether the urgent variation application was the last application under this section for a variation; and

                     (b)  whether or not the variation was granted.

             (6)  If the variation would extend the period of effect of a formal authority, the application (whether a formal variation application or an urgent variation application) must state the proposed period of the extension, which must not exceed:

                     (a)  in the case of a formal variation application—the period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 3 months (including any previous extensions); and

                     (b)  in the case of an urgent variation application—the lesser of:

                              (i)  7 days; and

                             (ii)  a period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 3 months (including any previous extensions).

             (7)  The authorising officer to whom the application is made may require the applicant to provide such information concerning the proposed variation as is necessary for the authorising officer’s proper consideration of the application.

             (8)  As soon as practicable after making an urgent variation application that was not made in writing, the applicant must make a written record of the application and give a copy of it to the authorising officer to whom the application was made.

##### <a id="15GQ"></a>15GQ  Requirements for variation of authority

             (1)  After considering an application for a variation of an authority, and any additional information provided under subsection 15GP(7), an appropriate authorising officer:

                     (a)  may vary the authority in accordance with the application, either unconditionally or subject to conditions; or

                     (b)  may refuse the application.

             (2)  An appropriate authorising officer must not vary an authority, whether on application or on the authorising officer’s own initiative, unless the authorising officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds:

                     (a)  that a serious Commonwealth offence or a serious State offence that has a federal aspect has been, is being or is likely to be, committed; and

                     (b)  that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity are such as to justify the variation; and

                     (c)  that any unlawful conduct involved in conducting the controlled operation will be limited to the maximum extent consistent with conducting an effective controlled operation; and

                     (d)  that the operation will be conducted in a way that ensures that, to the maximum extent possible, any illicit goods involved in the controlled operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer at the end of the controlled operation; and

                     (e)  that the proposed controlled conduct will be capable of being accounted for in a way that will enable the reporting requirements of Division 4 to be complied with; and

                      (f)  that the controlled operation will not be conducted in such a way that a person is likely to be induced to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (g)  that any conduct involved in the controlled operation will not:

                              (i)  seriously endanger the health or safety of any person; or

                             (ii)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                            (iii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; or

                            (iv)  result in significant loss of, or serious damage to, property (other than illicit goods); and

                     (h)  that any role assigned to a civilian participant in the operation is not one that could be adequately performed by a law enforcement officer.

##### <a id="15GR"></a>15GR  Manner of varying authority

             (1)  An authority may be varied by an appropriate authorising officer (whether on application or on the authorising officer’s own initiative) only:

                     (a)  in the case of a variation on the authorising officer’s own initiative or on a formal variation application (other than a variation referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii))—by means of a written document, signed by the authorising officer (such a variation is a **_formal variation of authority_**); or

                     (b)  in the case of a variation on:

                              (i)  an urgent variation application; or

                             (ii)  the authorising officer’s own initiative or a formal variation application, if the authorising officer is satisfied that the delay caused by granting a formal variation of authority may affect the success of the controlled operation;

                            orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such a variation is an **_urgent variation of authority_**).

             (2)  The authorising officer must, as soon as practicable, prepare and give a written document that complies with section 15GS to the applicant or, if the variation was on the initiative of the authorising officer, to the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation.

##### <a id="15GS"></a>15GS  Form of variation of authority

             (1)  A variation of an authority by an appropriate authorising officer (whether formal or urgent) must:

                     (a)  identify the controlled operation to which the authority relates; and

                     (b)  state the name and rank or position of the person varying the authority; and

                     (c)  if the authority was varied on an application made under section 15GP, state:

                              (i)  the name of the applicant; and

                             (ii)  whether the application was a formal variation application or an urgent variation application; and

                     (e)  describe the variation having regard to the matters referred to in subsection 15GO(2); and

                      (f)  if the variation extends the period of effect of a formal authority—state the period of the extension.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(f), the period of the extension must not exceed:

                     (a)  in the case of a formal variation of authority—the period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 3 months (including any previous extensions); and

                     (b)  in the case of an urgent variation of authority—the lesser of:

                              (i)  7 days; and

                             (ii)  a period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 3 months (including any previous extensions).

             (2)  An application cannot be made under subsection (1) for a variation that would extend the period of effect of a formal authority in such a way that the period of effect of the authority will, after the variation is made, exceed 24 months (including any previous extensions under this Subdivision or Subdivision B).

             (3)  An application for the variation may be made:

                     (a)  by means of a written document that is signed by the applicant (such an application is a **_formal variation application_**); or

             (4)  More than one application for a variation under this section may be made in respect of the same authority. However, if an urgent variation of authority was granted as a result of an application under this section, the next application must be a formal variation application.

             (5)  An application for a variation (whether a formal variation application or an urgent variation application) must state:

##### <a id="15GV"></a>15GV  Determination of application

             (1)  After considering an application for a variation of a formal authority, and any additional information provided under subsection 15GU(6), the nominated Tribunal member concerned:

                     (a)  may vary the authority in accordance with the application, either unconditionally or subject to conditions; or

                     (b)  may refuse the application.

             (2)  The nominated Tribunal member must not grant the variation unless the nominated Tribunal member is satisfied on reasonable grounds:

                     (a)  that a serious Commonwealth offence or a serious State offence that has a federal aspect has been, is being or is likely to be, committed; and

                     (b)  that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity are such as to justify the variation; and

                     (c)  that any unlawful conduct involved in conducting the controlled operation will be limited to the maximum extent consistent with conducting an effective controlled operation; and

                     (d)  that the operation will be conducted in a way that ensures that, to the maximum extent possible, any illicit goods involved in the controlled operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer at the end of the controlled operation; and

                     (g)  that any conduct involved in the controlled operation will not:

                              (i)  seriously endanger the health or safety of any person; or

                             (ii)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                            (iii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; or

                            (iv)  result in significant loss of, or serious damage to, property (other than illicit goods); and

                     (h)  that any role assigned to a civilian participant in the operation is not one that could be adequately performed by a law enforcement officer.

             (3)  A variation is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="15GW"></a>15GW  Manner of varying formal authority

             (1)  A formal authority may be varied by a nominated Tribunal member only:

                     (a)  in the case of a formal variation application (other than a formal variation application referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii))—by means of a written document, signed by the nominated Tribunal member (such a variation is a **_formal variation of authority_**); or

                     (b)  in the case of:

                              (i)  an urgent variation application; or

                             (ii)  a formal variation application, if the nominated Tribunal member is satisfied that the delay caused by granting a formal variation of authority may affect the success of the controlled operation;

                            orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such a variation is an **_urgent variation of authority_**).

             (2)  The nominated Tribunal member must, as soon as practicable, prepare and give a written document that complies with section 15GX to the applicant.

##### <a id="15GX"></a>15GX  Form of variation of formal authority

             (1)  A variation of a formal authority by a nominated Tribunal member (whether formal or urgent) must:

                     (a)  identify the controlled operation to which the authority relates; and

                     (b)  state the name and position of the person varying the authority; and

                     (c)  state the name of the applicant; and

                     (d)  state whether the application for the variation was a formal variation application or an urgent variation application; and

                     (e)  state the date and time when the variation of authority is or was granted; and

                      (f)  state the period of the extension.

             (2)  The period of the extension:

                     (a)  must not exceed the period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 24 months (including any previous extensions under this Subdivision or Subdivision B); and

                     (b)  must not exceed:

                              (i)  in the case of a formal variation of authority—3 months; and

                             (ii)  in the case of an urgent variation of authority—7 days.

#### Subdivision D—Other matters

##### <a id="15GY"></a>15GY  Cancellation of authorities

             (1)  An appropriate authorising officer may, by order in writing given to the principal law enforcement officer for a controlled operation, cancel the authority to conduct the controlled operation at any time and for any reason.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), an appropriate authorising officer may cancel an authority at any time at the request of the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation concerned.

             (3)  Cancellation of an authority takes effect at the time the order is made or at the later time specified in the order.

##### <a id="15GZ"></a>15GZ  Effect of authorities

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), an authority:

                     (a)  authorises each law enforcement participant in the controlled operation to which the authority relates who is identified in the authority to engage in the controlled conduct specified in the authority in respect of that participant; and

                     (b)  authorises each civilian participant (if any) in the controlled operation to which the authority relates who is identified in the authority to engage in the particular controlled conduct (if any) specified in the authority in respect of that participant.

             (2)  A person identified in an authority as being authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation is authorised to do so for the period of effect of the authority, unless:

                     (a)  the authority specifies a shorter period during which the person is so authorised; or

                     (b)  the authority is varied to provide that the person is no longer so authorised; or

                     (c)  the authority is cancelled before the end of that period.

             (3)  The authority to engage in controlled conduct given to a participant cannot be delegated to any other person.

##### <a id="15H"></a>15H  Defect in authority

                   An application for an authority or variation of an authority, and any authority or variation of an authority granted on the basis of such an application, is not invalidated by any defect, other than a defect that affects the application, authority or variation in a material particular.

### Division 3—Protection from criminal responsibility and related provisions

#### Subdivision A—Controlled operations under this Part

##### <a id="15HA"></a>15HA  Protection from criminal responsibility for controlled conduct during controlled operations

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a participant in a controlled operation engages in conduct in the course of, and for the purposes of, the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  engaging in that conduct is a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory.

             (2)  Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the participant is not criminally responsible for the offence, if:

                     (a)  the participant engages in the conduct in accordance with the authority to conduct the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  the participant is identified in the authority as a person authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; and

                     (c)  the conduct does not involve the participant intentionally inducing a person to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (d)  the conduct does not involve the participant engaging in any conduct that is likely to:

                              (i)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                             (ii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; and

                     (e)  if the participant is a civilian participant in the operation—he or she acts in accordance with the instructions of a law enforcement officer.

##### <a id="15HB"></a>15HB  Indemnification of participants against civil liability

                   The Commonwealth must indemnify a participant in a controlled operation against any civil liability (including reasonable costs) the participant incurs because of conduct the participant engages in if:

                     (a)  the participant engages in the conduct in the course of, and for the purposes of, the controlled operation in accordance with the authority to conduct the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  the participant is identified in the authority as a person authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; and

                     (c)  the conduct does not involve the participant intentionally inducing a person to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (d)  the conduct does not involve the participant engaging in any conduct that is likely to:

                              (i)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                             (ii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; and

                     (e)  if the participant is a civilian participant in the operation—he or she acts in accordance with the instructions of a law enforcement officer; and

                      (f)  the requirements (if any) specified in the regulations have been met.

##### <a id="15HC"></a>15HC  Effect of sections 15HA and 15HB on other laws relating to criminal investigation

                   Sections 15HA and 15HB do not apply to a person’s conduct that is, or could have been, authorised under Commonwealth law or a law of a State or Territory relating to the following:

                     (a)  arrest or detention of individuals;

                     (b)  searches of individuals;

                     (c)  entry onto, or searches or inspection of, premises;

                     (d)  searches, inspections or seizures of other property;

                     (e)  forensic procedure;

                      (f)  electronic surveillance devices or telecommunications interception;

                     (g)  identification procedures;

                     (h)  the acquisition or use of assumed identities;

                      (i)  any other matter concerning powers of criminal investigation.

##### <a id="15HD"></a>15HD  Effect of being unaware of variation or cancellation of authority

             (1)  If an authority to conduct a controlled operation is varied in a way that limits its scope, this Part continues to apply to a participant in the controlled operation as if the authority had not been varied in that way, for so long as the participant:

                     (a)  is unaware of the variation; and

                     (b)  is not reckless about the existence of the variation.

             (2)  If an authority to conduct a controlled operation is cancelled, this Part continues to apply to a person who was a participant in the controlled operation immediately before the cancellation as if the authority had not been cancelled in that way, for so long as the person:

                     (a)  is unaware of the cancellation; and

                     (b)  is not reckless about the existence of the cancellation.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a person is reckless about the existence of the variation or cancellation of an authority if:

                     (a)  the person is aware of a substantial risk that the variation or cancellation has happened; and

                     (b)  having regard to the circumstances known to the person, it is unjustifiable to take the risk that the authority has not been varied or cancelled.

##### <a id="15HE"></a>15HE  Protection from criminal responsibility for certain ancillary conduct

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a person engages in conduct (the**_ancillary conduct_**) that relates to controlled conduct (the **_related controlled conduct_**) engaged in by another person; and

                     (b)  engaging in the ancillary conduct is an ancillary offence in relation to the offence constituted by the related controlled conduct.

             (2)  Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the person who engaged in the ancillary conduct is not criminally responsible for the ancillary offence if, at the time the person engaged in the ancillary conduct, he or she believed the related controlled conduct was being engaged in, or would be engaged in, by a participant in a controlled operation authorised under this Part.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="ancillari-offenc"></a>**_ancillary offence_**, in relation to an offence constituted by related controlled conduct, means a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory:

                     (a)  of conspiring to commit the offence constituted by the related controlled conduct; or

                     (b)  of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring, inciting or being in any way knowingly concerned in, the commission of the offence constituted by the related controlled conduct.

##### <a id="15HF"></a>15HF  Compensation for property loss or serious damage

             (1)  If a person suffers loss of or serious damage to property, or personal injury, in the course of, or as a direct result of a controlled operation authorised under this Part, the Commonwealth is liable to pay to the person compensation as agreed between the Commonwealth and the person or, in default of agreement, as determined by action against the Commonwealth in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the person suffered the loss, damage or injury in the course of, or as a direct result of, engaging in any criminal activity (other than criminal activity that is controlled conduct); or

                     (b)  the person was a law enforcement participant at the time of suffering the loss, damage or injury.

##### <a id="15HG"></a>15HG  Notification requirements

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  any loss of or serious damage to property occurs in the course of, or as a direct result of, a controlled operation (other than property of the law enforcement agency on behalf of which the operation is conducted or a participant in the operation); or

                     (b)  any personal injury occurs in the course of, or as a direct result of, such an operation;

the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation must report the loss, damage or injury to the chief officer of the law enforcement agency as soon as practicable.

             (2)  If loss or serious damage to property is reported to the chief officer under subsection (1), the chief officer must take all reasonable steps to notify the owner of the property of the loss or damage.

             (3)  If a personal injury is reported to the chief officer under subsection (1), the chief officer must take all reasonable steps to notify the person that the injury occurred in the course of, or as a direct result of, the controlled operation.

             (4)  The chief officer is not required to give a notification under subsection (2) or (3) until the chief officer is satisfied that the notification would not:

                     (a)  compromise or hinder the controlled operation or any related investigation; or

                     (b)  compromise the identity of a participant in the controlled operation; or

                     (c)  endanger the life or safety of any person; or

                     (d)  prejudice any legal proceeding; or

                     (e)  otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

             (5)  A chief officer may, by written instrument, delegate any of the chief officer’s powers or functions under this section to:

                     (a)  in relation to the Australian Federal Police—a Deputy Commissioner or a person of equivalent or higher rank; or

                     (b)  in relation to Customs—a Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Customs or a person occupying an equivalent or higher position; or

                     (b)  engaging in that conduct is a Commonwealth offence.

             (2)  Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, the participant is not criminally responsible for the Commonwealth offence, if:

                     (a)  the conduct is authorised by, and is engaged in in accordance with, the authority to conduct the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  the conduct does not involve the participant intentionally inducing a person to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (c)  the conduct does not involve the participant engaging in any conduct that is likely to:

                              (i)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                             (ii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; and

                     (d)  if the person is a civilian participant in the operation—he or she acts in accordance with the instructions of a law enforcement officer.

             (3)  Expressions used in this section have the same meanings as in the corresponding State controlled operations law under which the operation was authorised.

##### <a id="15HI"></a>15HI  Effect of section 15HH on other laws relating to criminal investigation

                   Section 15HH does not apply to a person’s conduct that is, or could have been, authorised under a Commonwealth law or a law of a State or Territory relating to the following:

                              (i)  was engaged in by another person; and

                             (ii)  constitutes an offence for which a person would, but for section 15HH, be criminally responsible; and

                     (b)  engaging in the ancillary conduct is an ancillary offence (within the meaning of the _Criminal Code_) in relation to the offence constituted by the related conduct.

                     (a)  if the person is a law enforcement officer—identify the law enforcement agency of which the person is an officer; or

                     (b)  otherwise—identify the person.

                     (a)  endanger the safety of the person; or

                     (b)  prejudice an investigation or prosecution;

then the person is sufficiently identified for the purposes of paragraphs (2A)(b) and (2B)(b) if the person is identified:

             (2)  Each chief officer must advise the Minister of any information in a report that, in the chief officer’s opinion, should be excluded from the report before the report is laid before the Parliament because:

                             (ii)  prejudice an investigation or prosecution; or

                            (iii)  compromise any law enforcement agency’s operational activities or methodologies; or

             (3)  The Minister must exclude information from a report if the Minister is satisfied on the advice of the chief officer of any of the grounds set out in subsection (2) and must then cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the Minister receives it.

             (4)  A report must not disclose any information that identifies any person involved in an operation or that is likely to lead to such a person being identified.

             (5)  Nothing in this section requires particulars of a controlled operation to be included in a report for a year if the operation had not been completed as at 30 June in that year, but the particulars must instead be included in the report for the year in which the operation is completed.

             (6)  Nothing in this section requires particulars of a controlled operation to be included in a report for a year if the operation had not been completed as at 30 June in that year, but the particulars must instead be included in the report for the year in which the operation is completed.

             (7)  If a report relates, in whole or in part, to the work or activities of the ACC under a corresponding State controlled operations law, the Minister must, as soon as practicable after the report is laid before each House of the Parliament, send a copy of the report to the State or Territory Minister with responsibility for the corresponding State controlled operations law.

then the person is sufficiently identified for the purposes of paragraphs (2A)(b) and (2B)(b) if the person is identified:

                     (c)  by an assumed name under which the person is operating; or

                     (d)  by a code name or code number;

as long as the chief officer can match the assumed name, code name or code number to the person’s identity.

             (3)  A register kept under this section is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="15HV"></a>15HV  Ombudsman to be given information and access despite other laws

             (1)  Despite any other law, a person is not excused from giving information, answering a question, or giving access to a document, as and when required under this Division, on the ground that giving the information, answering the question, or giving access to the document, as the case may be:

                     (a)  would contravene a law; or

                     (b)  would be contrary to the public interest; or

                     (c)  might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty; or

                     (d)  would disclose one of the following:

                              (i)  a legal advice given to a Minister, a Department or a prescribed authority;

                             (ii)  a communication between an officer of a Department or of a prescribed authority and another person or body, being a communication protected against disclosure by legal professional privilege.

             (2)  However, if the person is a natural person:

is not admissible in evidence against the person except in a proceeding by way of a prosecution for an offence against section 15HK or 15HL of this Act or Part 7.4 or 7.7 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (3)  Nothing in section 15HK or 15HL or in any other law prevents an officer of an agency from:

                     (a)  giving information to an inspecting officer (whether orally or in writing and whether or not in answer to a question); or

                     (b)  giving access to a record of the agency to an inspecting officer;

for the purposes of an inspection under this Division of the agency’s records.

             (4)  Nothing in section 15HK or 15HL or in any other law prevents an officer of an agency from making a record of information, or causing a record of information to be made, for the purposes of giving the information to a person as permitted by subsection (3).

             (5)  The fact that a person is not excused under subsection (1) from giving information, answering a question or giving access to a document does not otherwise affect a claim of legal professional privilege that anyone may make in relation to that information, answer or document.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="prescrib-author"></a>**_prescribed authority_** has the same meaning as in the _Ombudsman Act 1976_.

             (2)  The Ombudsman may give information that:

                     (a)  relates to a State or Territory agency; and

                     (b)  was obtained by the Ombudsman under this Division;

to the State or Territory inspecting authority in relation to the agency.

             (3)  The Ombudsman may only give information to an authority under subsection (2) if the Ombudsman is satisfied that the giving of the information is necessary to enable the authority to perform its functions in relation to the State or Territory agency.

             (4)  The Ombudsman may receive from a State or Territory inspecting authority information relevant to the performance of the Ombudsman’s functions under this Division.

##### <a id="15HX"></a>15HX  Delegation by Ombudsman

##### <a id="15HY"></a>15HY  Ombudsman not to be sued

                   The Ombudsman, an inspecting officer, or a person acting under an inspecting officer’s direction or authority, is not liable to an action, suit or proceeding for or in relation to an act done, or omitted to be done, in good faith in the performance or exercise, or the purported performance or exercise, of a function or power conferred by this Division.

                   A document purporting to be an authority granted under section 15GI or under a corresponding State controlled operations law:

                     (b)  may refuse the application.

             (2)  An authority to acquire or use an assumed identity may not be granted unless the chief officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds:

                     (a)  that the assumed identity is necessary for one or more of the following purposes:

                              (i)  investigation of, or intelligence gathering in relation to, criminal activity (whether a particular criminal activity or criminal activity generally);

                             (ii)  the exercise of powers and performance of functions of an intelligence agency;

                            (iii)  the exercise of powers and performance of functions for the purposes of the National Witness Protection Program;

             (3)  If an authority is granted for an authorised civilian, the chief officer must appoint an officer of the law enforcement agency or the intelligence agency (as the case may be) to supervise the acquisition or use of the assumed identity by the authorised civilian.

             (4)  The officer appointed as supervisor must be:

             (5)  An authority may also authorise any one or more of the following:

                     (a)  an application of a kind referred to in section 15KG for an order for an entry in a register of births, deaths or marriages under a corresponding assumed identity law;

                     (b)  a request under section 15KI or 15KX;

                     (c)  the use of an assumed identity in a foreign country.

##### <a id="15KQ"></a>15KQ  Protection from criminal liability—authorised persons

                   If an authorised person does something  that, apart from this section, would be a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory, the person is not criminally responsible for the offence if:

                             (ii)  in the case of an authorised civilian—in accordance with any direction by his or her supervisor under the authority; and

                     (c)  doing the thing would not be an offence if the assumed identity were the person’s real identity.

##### <a id="15KR"></a>15KR  Protection from criminal liability—third parties

                   If a person does something that, apart from this section, would be a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory, the person is not criminally responsible for the offence if:

                     (a)  the person is a Commonwealth officer; and

                     (b)  the thing is done in the course of the person’s duty; and

                     (c)  the chief officer who granted the authority has authorised the doing of the thing; and

                     (d)  if an authorised person had done the thing in accordance with an authority, the authorised person would not have been criminally responsible for the offence because of the application of section 15KQ.

##### <a id="15KS"></a>15KS  Indemnity for authorised persons

             (1)  This section applies if the chief officer of either a law enforcement agency or an intelligence agency grants an authority.

             (2)  The Commonwealth must indemnify the authorised person under the authority for any liability incurred by the person (including reasonable costs) because of something done by the person  if:

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies whether or not the person has acquired, as evidence of an assumed identity, a document that indicates that he or she has that qualification.

Example:    An officer who cannot fly a plane is not authorised to fly even though he or she has acquired a pilot’s licence under an assumed identity.

##### <a id="15KU"></a>15KU  Effect of being unaware of variation or cancellation of authority

             (1)  If an authority has been varied in a way that limits its scope, this Part continues to apply to the authorised person to whom it relates as if it had not been varied in that way, for as long as the person:

                     (b)  is not reckless about the existence of the variation.

             (2)  If an authority has been cancelled, this Part continues to apply to the authorised person to whom it related as if it had not been cancelled, for as long as the person:

                     (a)  is unaware of the cancellation; and

                     (b)  is not reckless about the existence of the cancellation.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a person is reckless about the existence of the variation or cancellation of an authority or authorisation if:

                     (a)  the person is aware of a substantial risk that the variation or cancellation has happened; and

                     (b)  having regard to the circumstances known to the person, it is unjustifiable to take the risk that the authority has not been varied or cancelled.

##### <a id="15KV"></a>15KV  Transfer of control of authorities

             (1)  The chief officer of an intelligence agency (the **_originating agency_**) may agree in writing with the chief officer of another intelligence agency (the **_receiving agency_**) to transfer control of an authority to the chief officer of the receiving agency if:

                     (a)  the authority was granted by the chief officer of the originating agency; or

                     (b)  control of the authority was transferred to the chief officer of the originating agency under a previous application of this subsection.

Note:          The chief officer may delegate functions under this section—see section 15LH.

             (2)  The chief officer of a law enforcement agency (the **_originating agency_**) may agree in writing with the chief officer of another law enforcement agency (the **_receiving agency_**) to transfer control of an authority to the chief officer of the receiving agency if:

                     (a)  the authority was granted by the chief officer of the originating agency; or

                     (b)  control of the authority was transferred to the chief officer of the originating agency under a previous application of this subsection.

Note:          The chief officer may delegate functions under this section—see section 15LH.

             (3)  The chief officer of the originating agency must give the chief officer of the receiving agency a written document setting out:

                     (a)  whether the authority has been reviewed under section 15KF, and if so, when a review was last conducted; and

                     (b)  whether control of the authority has previously been transferred under this section, and if so:

                              (i)  the date of each such transfer; and

                             (ii)  the name of the originating agency and receiving agency in relation to each such transfer.

             (4)  Control of the authority is transferred at the time when the chief officer of the receiving agency signs and dates a copy of the authority.

             (5)  Despite subsection (4), if the authority relates to an authorised civilian, control of the authority is not transferred until the chief officer of the receiving agency appoints an officer of that agency to be the authorised civilian’s supervisor.

             (6)  The chief officer of the receiving agency must vary the authority in accordance with section 15KE to state the name of the supervisor appointed under subsection (5).

             (7)  Control of an authority must not be transferred under this section if:

                     (a)  the person who is to acquire or use the assumed identity, or who has acquired or used the assumed identity, is a foreign officer authorised to acquire or use the assumed identity by the chief officer of a law enforcement agency; or

                     (b)  the assumed identity is to be, is being or has been used in a foreign country and the authority was granted by the chief officer of a law enforcement agency.

##### <a id="15KW"></a>15KW  Consequences of transfer of control of authorities

             (1)  This section sets out the consequences of the transfer of control of an authority under section 15KV.

             (2)  The authority continues to be in force after the transfer.

             (3)  The following provisions have effect, after the transfer, as if the chief officer of the receiving agency had granted the authority instead of the chief officer of the originating agency:

                     (a)  section 15KE (which deals with variation and cancellation of authorities);

                     (b)  section 15KF (which deals with review of authorities);

                     (c)  sections 15KI and 15KX (which deal with requests for evidence of assumed identities).

             (4)  To avoid doubt, the obligation under section 15KF, as that section has effect because of subsection (3), for the chief officer of the receiving agency to review the authority, only arises:

                     (a)  in the case of an authority transferred under subsection 15KV(1):

                              (i)  3 years after the last review of the authority by the chief officer of an intelligence agency; or

                             (ii)  if no such review has been undertaken—3 years after the authority was granted; and

                     (b)  in the case of an authority transferred under subsection 15KV(2):

                              (i)  12 months after the last review of the authority by the chief officer of a law enforcement agency; or

                             (ii)  if no such review has been undertaken—12 months after the authority was granted.

             (5)  Section 15KL (which deals with cancellation of evidence of assumed identity) has effect as if the chief officer of the receiving agency had made the request under section 15KI.

                     (b)  give evidence of the assumed identity to the following:

                              (i)  the authorised person named in the authority;

                             (ii)  an officer of the law enforcement agency or the intelligence agency who is named in the request.

Note 1:       The chief officer may delegate functions under this section—see section 15LH.

                     (a)  the liability is incurred because of something done in the course of duty by the issuing agency or the officer of the issuing agency to comply with the request; and

                     (b)  any requirements prescribed under the regulations have been met.

##### <a id="15LA"></a>15LA  Application of this Part to authorities under corresponding laws

             (1)  The following provisions apply to anything done in relation to a corresponding authority as if it were an authority granted under section 15KB:

### Division 2—General sentencing principles

##### <a id="16A"></a>16A  Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc.

             (1)  In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.

             (2)  In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:

                     (a)  the nature and circumstances of the offence;

                     (b)  other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account;

                     (c)  if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character—that course of conduct;

                     (d)  the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence;

                     (e)  any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;

                      (f)  the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence:

                              (i)  by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; or

                             (ii)  in any other manner;

                    (fa)  the extent to which the person has failed to comply with:

                              (i)  any order under subsection 23CD(1) of the _Federal Court of Australia Act 1976_; or

                             (ii)  any obligation under a law of the Commonwealth; or

                            (iii)  any obligation under a law of the State or Territory applying under subsection 68(1) of the _Judiciary Act 1903_;

                            about pre‑trial disclosure, or ongoing disclosure, in proceedings relating to the offence;

                     (g)  if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence—that fact;

                     (h)  the degree to which the person has co‑operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences;

                      (j)  the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person;

                     (k)  the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence;

                    (m)  the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person;

                     (n)  the prospect of rehabilitation of the person;

                     (p)  the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants.

          (2A)  However, the court must not take into account under subsection (1) or (2) any form of customary law or cultural practice as a reason for:

                     (a)  excusing, justifying, authorising, requiring or lessening the seriousness of the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates; or

                     (b)  aggravating the seriousness of the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates.

          (2B)  In subsection (2A):

                    <a name="crimin-behaviour"></a>**_criminal behaviour_** includes:

                     (a)  any conduct, omission to act, circumstance or result that is, or forms part of, a physical element of the offence in question; and

                     (b)  any fault element relating to such a physical element.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsections (1) and (2), in determining whether a sentence or order under subsection 19B(1), 20(1) or 20AB(1) is the appropriate sentence or order to be passed or made in respect of a federal offence, the court must have regard to the nature and severity of the conditions that may be imposed on, or may apply to, the offender, under that sentence or order.

             (4)  For the purposes of a reference in this section to a family, the members of a person’s family are taken to include the following (without limitation):

                     (a)  a de facto partner of the person;

                     (b)  someone who is the child of the person, or of whom the person is the child, because of the definition of **_child_** in section 3;

                     (c)  anyone else who would be a member of the person’s family if someone mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) is taken to be a member of the person’s family.

##### <a id="16B"></a>16B  Court to have regard to other periods of imprisonment required to be served

                   In sentencing a person convicted of a federal offence, a court must have regard to:

                     (a)  any sentence already imposed on the person by the court or another court for any other federal offence or for any State or Territory offence, being a sentence that the person has not served; and

                     (b)  any sentence that the person is liable to serve because of the revocation of a parole order made, or licence granted, under this Part or under a law of a State or Territory.

##### <a id="16BA"></a>16BA  Taking other offences into account

             (1)  Where a person is convicted of a federal offence or federal offences, and the court before which the person is convicted is satisfied that:

                     (a)  there has been filed in the court a document in, or to the effect of, the form prescribed for the purposes of this section;

                     (b)  the document contains a list of other federal offences, or offences against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, which the person convicted is believed to have committed;

                     (c)  the document has been signed:

                              (i)  by the Director of Public Prosecutions;

                             (ii)  for and on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, by a person authorized by the Director of Public Prosecutions, by instrument in writing, to sign documents under this subsection; or

                            (iii)  by a person appointed under section 69 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_ to prosecute indictable federal offences;

                            and by the person convicted;

                     (d)  a copy of the document has been given to the person; and

                     (e)  in all the circumstances it is proper to do so;

the court may, with the consent of the prosecutor and before passing sentence on the person, ask him or her whether he or she admits his or her guilt in respect of all or any of the offences specified in the list and wishes them to be taken into account by the court in passing sentence on him or her for the offence or offences of which he or she has been convicted.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if the person admits his or her guilt in respect of all or any of the offences specified in the list and wishes to have them taken into account by the court in passing sentence on him or her for the offence or offences of which he or she has been convicted, the court may, if it thinks fit, in passing sentence on him or her for the offence or offences of which he or she has been convicted, take into account all or any of the offences in respect of which the person has admitted his or her guilt.

             (3)  The court shall not take into account under this section any indictable offence that it would not have jurisdiction to try even if the defendant consented to the court hearing and determining proceedings for the offence or the prosecutor requested the court to hear and determine those proceedings.

          (3A)  Subsection (3) does not prevent a court from taking into account an indictable offence where the court has jurisdiction to sentence a person charged with that offence.

             (4)  Where the court takes into account under this section all or any of the offences in respect of which the person has admitted his or her guilt, the sentence passed on him or her for any of the offences of which he or she has been convicted shall not exceed the maximum penalty that the court would have been empowered to impose on him or her for the offence if no offence had been so taken into account.

             (5)  Where an offence is taken into account under this section, the court may make such orders with respect to reparation, restitution, compensation, costs and forfeiture as it would have been empowered to make if the person had been convicted before the court of the offence, but shall not otherwise impose any separate punishment for the offence.

             (6)  Where the court makes an order under subsection (5) in respect of an offence taken into account under this section, there shall be such rights of appeal in respect of the order as there would have been if the order had been an order made upon the conviction of the person for that offence.

             (7)  An order made under subsection (5) in respect of an offence taken into account under this section lapses, by force of this subsection, if the conviction or each conviction, as the case may be, in respect of which the offence was taken into account is quashed or set aside.

             (8)  Where an offence is taken into account under this section, the court shall certify, upon the document filed in the court, the offence taken into account and the conviction or convictions in respect of which the offence was taken into account and thereafter no proceedings shall be taken or continued in respect of the offence unless the conviction or each conviction, as the case may be, in respect of which the offence has been taken into account has been quashed or set aside.

             (9)  An admission of guilt made under and for the purposes of this section is not admissible in evidence in any proceedings taken or continued in respect of the offence in respect of which the admission was made or in respect of any other offence specified in the list contained in the document filed in the court.

           (10)  An offence taken into account under this section shall not, by reason of its so being taken into account, be regarded for any purpose as an offence of which a person has been convicted.

           (11)  In or in relation to any criminal proceeding, reference may lawfully be made to, or evidence may lawfully be given of, the fact that an offence was taken into account under this section in passing sentence for an offence for which a person was convicted if, in or in relation to that proceeding:

                     (a)  reference may lawfully be made to, or evidence may lawfully be given of, the fact that the person was convicted of the last‑mentioned offence; and

                     (b)  had the person been convicted of the offence so taken into account, reference could lawfully have been made to, or evidence could lawfully have been given of, the fact that the person had been convicted of that offence.

           (12)  The fact that an offence was taken into account under this section may be proved in the same manner as the conviction or any of the convictions, as the case may be, in relation to which it was taken into account may be proved.

##### <a id="16C"></a>16C  Fines

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), before imposing a fine on a person for a federal offence, a court must take into account the financial circumstances of the person, in addition to any other matters that the court is required or permitted to take into account.

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) prevents a court from imposing a fine on a person because the financial circumstances of the offender cannot be ascertained by the court.

##### <a id="16D"></a>16D  No corporal punishment

             (1)  A court must not impose any form of corporal punishment for a federal offence.

             (2)  A person serving a federal sentence must not be subjected to any form of corporal punishment.

### Division 3—Sentences of imprisonment

##### <a id="16E"></a>16E  Commencement of sentences

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the law of a State or Territory relating to the commencement of sentences and of non‑parole periods applies to a person who is sentenced in that State or Territory for a federal offence in the same way as it applies to a person who is sentenced in that State or Territory for a State or Territory offence.

             (2)  Where the law of a State or Territory has the effect that a sentence imposed on a person for an offence against the law of that State or Territory or a non‑parole period fixed in respect of that sentence:

                     (a)  may be reduced by the period that the person has been in custody for the offence; or

                     (b)  is to commence on the day on which the person was taken into custody for the offence;

the law applies in the same way to a federal sentence imposed on a person in that State or Territory or to a non‑parole period fixed in respect of that sentence.

             (3)  Where the law of a State or Territory does not have the effect mentioned in subsection (2), a court (including a federal court) in that State or Territory that imposes a federal sentence on a person or fixes a non‑parole period in respect of such a sentence must take into account any period that the person has spent in custody in relation to the offence concerned.

##### <a id="16F"></a>16F  Court to explain sentence

             (1)  Where a court imposes a federal sentence on a person and fixes a non‑parole period in respect of the sentence, it must explain or cause to be explained to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the purpose and consequences of fixing that non‑parole period including, in particular, an explanation:

                     (a)  that service of the sentence will entail a period of imprisonment of not less than the non‑parole period and, if a parole order is made, a period of service in the community, called the parole period, to complete service of the sentence; and

                     (b)  that, if a parole order is made, the order will be subject to conditions; and

                     (c)  that the parole order may be amended or revoked; and

                     (d)  of the consequences that may follow if the person fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfil those conditions.

             (2)  Where a court imposes a federal sentence on a person and makes a recognizance release order in respect of that sentence, it must explain or cause to be explained to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the purpose and consequences of making the recognizance release order including, in particular, an explanation:

                     (a)  that service of the sentence will entail a period of imprisonment equal to the pre‑release period (if any) specified in the order and a period of service in the community equal to the balance of the sentence; and

                     (b)  of the conditions to which the order is subject; and

                     (c)  of the consequences that may follow if the person fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfil those conditions; and

                     (d)  that any recognizance given in accordance with the order may be discharged or varied under section 20AA.

##### <a id="17A"></a>17A  Restriction on imposing sentences

             (1)  A court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment on any person for a federal offence, or for an offence against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, unless the court, after having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.

             (2)  Where a court passes a sentence of imprisonment on a person for a federal offence, or for an offence against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, the court:

                     (a)  shall state the reasons for its decision that no other sentence is appropriate; and

                     (b)  shall cause those reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

             (3)  The failure of a court to comply with the provisions of this section does not invalidate any sentence.

             (4)  This section applies subject to any contrary intention in the law creating the offence.

##### <a id="17B"></a>17B  Restriction on imposing sentences for certain minor offences

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of one or more section 17B offences relating to property, money or both, whose total value is not more than $2,000; and

                     (b)  the person has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment for any federal, State or Territory offence;

the court convicting the person is not to pass a sentence of imprisonment for that offence, or for any of those offences, unless the court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances that warrant it.

             (2)  In calculating the total value for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a section 17B offence which the court, with the consent of the person charged, has taken into account in passing sentence on the person for another federal offence (whether a section 17B offence or not) is taken to be an offence of which the person is convicted.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="section-17b-offenc"></a>**_section 17B offence_** means an offence against section 29 of this Act, an offence against section 131.1, 132.1, 132.6, 132.7, 134.1, 134.2, 135.1, 135.2, 135.4, 145.4 or 145.5 of the _Criminal Code_ or an offence against a provision of a federal law prescribed for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Sentence of imprisonment

             (1)  Where imprisonment is imposed in respect of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth it may (unless the contrary intention appears in the law) be imposed either with or without hard labour.

             (2)  Where under the law of a State or Territory a convicted person may in particular cases be imprisoned in a particular kind or class of prison, a person convicted of an offence against the law of the Commonwealth may, in corresponding cases, be imprisoned in the kind or class of prison appropriate to the circumstances.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Cumulative, partly cumulative or concurrent sentences

             (1)  Where a person who is convicted of a federal offence or federal offences is at the time of that conviction or those convictions, serving, or subject to, one or more federal, State or Territory sentences, the court must, when imposing a federal sentence for that federal offence, or for each of those federal offences, by order direct when the federal sentence commences, but so that:

                     (a)  no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and

                     (b)  if a non‑parole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences—the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that non‑parole period commences immediately after the end of the period.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of 2 or more federal offences at the same sitting; and

                     (b)  the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences;

the court must, by order, direct when each sentence commences, but so that no sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or of the last to end of those sentences.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of a federal offence or offences, and a State or Territory offence or offences, at the same sitting; and

                     (b)  the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences;

the court must, by order, direct when each federal sentence commences but so that:

                     (c)  no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and

                     (d)  if a non‑parole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences—the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that non‑parole period commences immediately after the end of the period.

             (4)  For the purpose of fixing the commencement of a sentence under this section, a reference in this section to a sentence the commencement of which has already been fixed includes a reference to another sentence imposed at the same time as the first‑mentioned sentence.

##### <a id="19A"></a>19A  Detention of person in State or Territory prisons

                   A federal offender who is ordered by a court or a prescribed authority to be detained in prison in a State or Territory, may be detained in any prison in that State or Territory and may be removed from one prison to another prison in that State or Territory as if the person were detained as a State offender or Territory offender.

##### <a id="19AA"></a>19AA  Remissions and reductions of sentences

             (1)  A law of a State or Territory that provides for the remission or reduction of State or Territory sentences (other than such part of the law as relates to the remission or reduction of non‑parole periods of imprisonment or of periods of imprisonment equivalent to pre‑release periods of imprisonment in respect of recognizance release orders) applies in the same way to the remission or reduction of a federal sentence in a prison of that State or Territory, being a sentence imposed after the commencement of this section.

             (2)  Where a law of a State or Territory provides that a person is to be taken to be serving a State or Territory sentence during the period from the time of release under a parole order or licence (however called) until the parole order or licence is, or is taken to be, revoked, the law:

                     (a)  is, for the purposes of subsection (1), to be taken to be providing for the remission or reduction of sentences; and

                     (b)  applies to any calculation of the part of a federal sentence remaining to be served at the time of a federal offender’s release under a federal parole order or licence as if the sentence were a State or Territory sentence.

             (3)  Where a federal offender who is released on parole or licence and whose parole order or licence has subsequently been revoked does not get the benefit of subsection (2) in calculating the part of any federal sentence of imprisonment remaining to be served at the time of release:

                     (a)  a court fixing a new non‑parole period in respect of such a person under section 19AR; or

                     (b)  a prescribed authority fixing a non‑parole period in respect of such a person under section 19AW;

must have regard to the period of time spent by the person on parole or licence before that parole order or licence is revoked or is to be taken to have been revoked.

             (4)  A law of a State or Territory that provides for the remission or reduction, by reason of industrial action taken by prison warders, of the non‑parole period of a State or Territory sentence applies in the same way to the remission or reduction:

                     (a)  of a federal non‑parole period to be served in a prison in that State or Territory; and

                     (b)  of a federal pre‑release period to be served in that State or Territory.

### Division 4—The fixing of non‑parole periods and the making of recognizance release orders

##### <a id="19AB"></a>19AB  When court must fix non‑parole period or make a recognizance release order

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), where:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of a federal offence, or of 2 or more federal offences at the same sitting; and

                     (b)  a court imposes on the person a federal life sentence, or a federal sentence that exceeds, or federal sentences that, in the aggregate, exceed 3 years; and

                     (c)  at the time the sentence or sentences are imposed, the person is not already serving or subject to a federal sentence;
