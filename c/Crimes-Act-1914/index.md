##### <a id="3AA"></a>3AA   State offences that have a federal aspect

Object

          (1A)  The object of this section is to identify State offences that have a federal aspect because:

                     (a)  they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the elements of the State offence; or

                     (b)  they potentially fall within Commonwealth legislative power because of the circumstances in which the State offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be acts or omissions involved in committing the offence); or

                     (c)  the Australian Federal Police investigating them is incidental to the Australian Federal Police investigating an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory.

State offences that have a federal aspect

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a State offence has a **_federal aspect_** if, and only if:

                     (a)  both:

                              (i)  the State offence is not an ancillary offence; and

                             (ii)  assuming that the provision creating the State offence had been enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth instead of by the Parliament of the State—the provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  both:

                              (i)  the State offence is an ancillary offence that relates to a particular primary offence; and

                             (ii)  assuming that the provision creating the primary offence had been enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth instead of by the Parliament of the State—the provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (c)  assuming that the Parliament of the Commonwealth had enacted a provision that created an offence penalising the specific acts or omissions involved in committing the State offence—that provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (d)  both:

                              (i)  the Australian Federal Police is investigating an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory; and

                             (ii)  if the Australian Federal Police is investigating, or were to investigate, the State offence—that investigation is, or would be, incidental to the investigation mentioned in subparagraph (i).

Specificity of acts or omissions

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the specificity of the acts or omissions involved in committing a State offence is to be determined having regard to the circumstances in which the offence was committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be elements of the offence).

State offences covered by paragraph (1)(c)

             (3)  A State offence is taken to be covered by paragraph (1)(c) if the conduct constituting the State offence:

                     (a)  affects the interests of:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth; or

                             (ii)  an authority of the Commonwealth; or

                            (iii)  a constitutional corporation; or

                     (b)  was engaged in by a constitutional corporation; or

                     (c)  was engaged in in a Commonwealth place; or

                     (d)  involved the use of a postal service or other like service; or

                     (e)  involved an electronic communication; or

                      (f)  involved trade or commerce:

                              (i)  between Australia and places outside Australia; or

                             (ii)  among the States; or

                            (iii)  within a Territory, between a State and a Territory or between 2 Territories; or

                     (g)  involved:

                              (i)  banking (other than State banking not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or

                             (ii)  insurance (other than State insurance not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or

                     (h)  relates to a matter outside Australia; or

                      (i)  relates to a matter in respect of which an international agreement to which Australia is a party imposes obligations to which effect could be given by the creation of an offence against the domestic laws of the parties to the agreement; or

                      (j)  relates to a matter that affects the relations between Australia and another country or countries or is otherwise a subject of international concern.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not limit paragraph (1)(c).

##### <a id="3ZM"></a>3ZM  Identification parades

             (1)  This section applies to identification parades held in relation to offences.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3) and to section 3ZN, an identification parade:

                     (a)  may be held if the suspect agrees; or

                     (b)  must be held if:

                              (i)  the suspect has requested that an identification parade be held; and

                             (ii)  it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so.

          (2A)  Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account in determining whether it is reasonable in the circumstances to hold an identification parade, the following must be taken into account:

                     (a)  the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned;

                     (b)  the likely importance in the circumstances of the evidence of identification;

                     (c)  the practicality of holding an identification parade, having regard, among other things:

                              (i)  if the suspect fails to cooperate in the conduct of the parade—to the manner and extent of, and the reason (if any) for, the failure; and

                             (ii)  in any case—to whether an identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence; and

                     (d)  the appropriateness of holding an identification parade, having regard, among other things, to the relationship (if any) between the suspect and the person who may make an identification at the identification parade.

             (3)  An identification parade must not be held unless the suspect has been informed that:

                     (a)  he or she is entitled to refuse to take part in the parade; and

                     (b)  if he or she refuses to take part in the parade:

                              (i)  evidence of the refusal may be given in later proceedings relating to an offence, for the purpose of explaining why an identification parade was not held; and

                             (ii)  evidence may be given in such proceedings of any identification of the suspect by a witness as a result of having seen a photograph or having seen the suspect otherwise than during an identification parade; and

                     (c)  in addition to any requirement under section 3ZN, a legal representative or other person of the suspect’s choice may be present while the person is deciding whether to take part in the parade, and during the holding of the parade, if arrangements for that person to be present can be made within a reasonable time.

             (4)  The giving of the information referred to in subsection (3) must be recorded by a video recording or an audio recording.

             (5)  An identification parade must be arranged and conducted in a manner that will not unfairly prejudice the suspect.

             (6)  Without limiting the intent of subsection (5), an identification parade must be arranged and conducted in accordance with the following rules:

                     (a)  the parade must consist of at least 9 persons;

                     (b)  each of the persons who is not the suspect must:

                              (i)  resemble the suspect in age, height and general appearance; and

                             (ii)  not have features that will be visible during the parade that are markedly different from those of the suspect as described by the witness before viewing the parade;

                     (c)  unless it is impracticable for another constable to arrange or conduct the parade, no constable who has taken part in the investigation relating to the offence may take part in the arrangements for, or the conduct of, the parade;

                     (d)  no person in the parade is to be dressed in a way that would obviously distinguish him or her from the other participants;

                     (e)  if it is practicable to do so, numbers should be placed next to each participant in order to allow the witness to make an identification by indicating the number of the person identified;

                      (f)  the parade may take place so that the witness can view the parade without being seen if the witness requests that it take place in such a manner and:

                              (i)  a legal representative or other person of the suspect’s choice is present with the witness; or

                             (ii)  the parade is recorded by a video recording;

                     (g)  nothing is to be done that suggests or is likely to suggest to a witness which member of the parade is the suspect;

                     (h)  if the witness so requests, members of the parade may be required to speak, move or adopt a specified posture but, if this happens, the witness must be reminded that the members of the parade have been chosen on the basis of physical appearance only;

                      (i)  the suspect may select where he or she wishes to stand in the parade;

                      (j)  if more than one witness is to view the parade:

                              (i)  each witness must view the parade alone; and

                             (ii)  the witnesses are not to communicate with each other at a time after arrangements for the parade have commenced and before each of them has viewed the parade; and

                            (iii)  the suspect may change places in the parade after each viewing;

                     (k)  each witness must be told that:

                              (i)  the suspect may not be in the parade; and

                             (ii)  if he or she is unable to identify the suspect with reasonable certainty he or she must say so;

                      (l)  the parade must be recorded by a video recording if it is practicable to do so and, if that is done, a copy of the video recording must be made available to the suspect or his or her legal representative as soon as it is practicable to do so;

                    (m)  if the parade is not recorded by a video recording:

                              (i)  the parade must be photographed in colour; and

                             (ii)  a print of a photograph of the parade that is at least 250mm ´ 200mm in size must be made available to the suspect or his or her legal representative; and

                            (iii)  the constable in charge of the parade must take all reasonable steps to record everything said and done at the parade and must make a copy of the record available to the suspect or his or her legal representative;

                     (n)  the suspect may have present during the holding of the parade a legal representative or other person of his or her choice if arrangements for that person to be present can be made within a reasonable time.

             (7)  Nothing in this Act affects the determination of the following questions:

                     (a)  whether or not evidence of a suspect having refused to take part in an identification parade is admissible;

                     (b)  if evidence of such a refusal is admissable, what inferences (if any) may be drawn by a court or jury from the refusal;

                     (c)  whether, after such a refusal, evidence of alternative methods of identification is admissible.

             (8)  If a witness is, under the supervision of a constable, to attempt to identify a suspect otherwise than during an identification parade, the constable must ensure that the attempted identification is done in a manner that is fair to the suspect.

##### <a id="3ZN"></a>3ZN  Identification parades for suspects under 18 etc.

             (1)  An identification parade must not be held for a suspect who is under 10.

             (2)  An identification parade must not be held for a suspect who is incapable of managing his or her affairs unless a magistrate orders that it be held.

             (3)  An identification parade must not be held for a suspect who:

                     (a)  is at least 10 but under 18; and

unless one of the following paragraphs applies:

                     (c)  the suspect agrees to or requests in writing the holding of the parade and a parent or guardian of the suspect agrees in writing to the holding of the parade or, if the parent or guardian is not acceptable to the suspect, another person (other than a constable) who is capable of representing the interests of the suspect and who, as far as is practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the suspect agrees in writing to the holding of the parade;

                     (d)  if:

                              (i)  one of those persons agrees in writing to the holding of the parade but the other does not; and

                             (ii)  a magistrate orders that the parade be held.

             (4)  In deciding whether to make such an order, the magistrate must have regard to:

                     (a)  the seriousness of the offence; and

                     (b)  the age or any disability of the person; and

                     (c)  such other matters as the magistrate thinks fit.

             (5)  An identification parade for a suspect who is under 18 or is incapable of managing his or her affairs must be held in the presence of:

                     (a)  a parent or guardian of the suspect; or

                     (b)  if the parent or guardian is not acceptable to the suspect, another person (other than a constable) who is capable of representing the interests of the suspect and who, as far as is practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the suspect.

##### <a id="3ZO"></a>3ZO  Identification by means of photographs

             (1)  If a suspect is in custody in respect of an offence or is otherwise available to take part in an identification parade, a constable investigating the offence must not show photographs, or composite pictures or pictures of a similar kind, to a witness for the purpose of establishing, or obtaining evidence of, the identity of the suspect unless:

                     (a)  the suspect has refused to take part in an identification parade; or

                    (aa)  the suspect’s appearance has changed significantly since the offence was committed; or

                     (b)  the holding of an identification parade would be:

                              (i)  unfair to the suspect; or

                             (ii)  unreasonable in the circumstances.

          (1A)  Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account in determining whether it would be unreasonable in the circumstances to hold an identification parade, the following must be taken into account:

                     (a)  the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned;

                     (b)  the likely importance in the circumstances of the evidence of identification;

                     (c)  the practicality of holding an identification parade, having regard, among other things:

                              (i)  if the suspect fails to cooperate in the conduct of the parade—to the manner and extent of, and the reason (if any) for, the failure; and

                             (ii)  in any case—to whether an identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence; and

                     (d)  the appropriateness of holding an identification parade, having regard, among other things, to the relationship (if any) between the suspect and the person who may make an identification at the identification parade.

             (2)  If a constable investigating an offence shows photographs or pictures to a witness for the purpose of establishing, or obtaining evidence of, the identity of a suspect, whether or not the suspect is in custody, the following rules apply:

                     (a)  the constable must show to the witness photographs or pictures of at least 9 different persons;

                     (b)  each photograph or picture of a person who is not the suspect must be of a person who:

                              (i)  resembles the suspect in age and general appearance; and

                             (ii)  does not have features visible in the photograph or picture that are markedly different from those of the suspect as described by the witness before viewing the photographs or pictures;

                   (ba)  the photographs or pictures shown to the witness must not suggest that they are photographs or pictures of persons in police custody;

                     (c)  the constable must not, in doing so, act unfairly towards the suspect or suggest to the witness that a particular photograph or picture is the photograph or picture of the suspect or of a person who is being sought by the police in respect of an offence;

                     (d)  if practicable, the photograph or picture of the suspect must have been taken or made after he or she was arrested or was considered as a suspect;

                     (g)  the constable must notify the suspect or his or her legal representative in writing that a copy of the record is available for the suspect;

                     (h)  the constable must retain the photographs or pictures shown, and must allow the suspect or his or her legal representative, upon application, an opportunity to inspect the photographs or pictures.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a photograph or picture of a person who is suspected in relation to the commission of an offence is shown to a witness; and

                     (b)  the photograph was taken or the picture made after the suspect was arrested or was considered to be a suspect; and

                     (c)  proceedings in relation to the offence referred to in paragraph (a) or another offence arising out of the same course of conduct for which the photograph was taken or picture made are brought against the suspect before a jury; and

                     (d)  the photograph or picture is admitted into evidence;

the jury must be informed that the photograph was taken or the picture made after the suspect was arrested or was considered as a suspect.

             (4)  If a suspect is in custody in respect of an offence, a constable investigating the offence must not show a composite picture or a picture of a similar kind to a witness for the purpose of assisting the witness to describe the features of the suspect.

             (5)  If, after a constable investigating an offence has shown to a witness a composite picture or a picture of a similar kind for the purpose referred to in subsection (4):

                     (a)  a suspect comes into custody in respect of the offence; and

          (3A)  Where an Act (whether enacted before or after the commencement of this subsection) confers power to make an instrument (including rules, regulations or by‑laws but not including a law of a Territory) and specifies the maximum pecuniary penalty that can be imposed for offences created by such an instrument, then:

                     (a)  unless the contrary intention appears, the specified penalty is taken to be the maximum penalty that the instrument can prescribe for such offences by natural persons; and

                     (b)  where a body corporate is convicted of such an offence—the specifying of that penalty is not to be treated as an indication of a contrary intention for the purposes of applying subsection (3).

             (3)  Where an act or omission constitutes an offence against a law of a Territory, the validity of that law is not affected merely because the act or omission also constitutes an offence against a law of the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="4D"></a>4D  Penalties

             (1)  Except so far as the contrary intention appears, a penalty, whether pecuniary or otherwise, set out at the foot of any provision of an Act as described in a paragraph of subsection (1A) indicates:

             (4)  Without limiting subsection (3), this section does not apply to an indictable offence:

##### <a id="4L"></a>4L  Specified defences not to preclude other defences

                   Where a provision of a law of the Commonwealth provides a defence to a particular offence, the provision does not, unless the contrary intention appears, prevent the use of any defence that is otherwise available.

                     (a)  if the court is satisfied that the articles are forfeited—shall order that the articles be condemned; or

                     (b)  if the court is not so satisfied—shall order that the articles be delivered to such person as the court is satisfied is entitled to the articles.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Remand of defendant

                   Where a person is charged, before a court of summary jurisdiction, with an offence against the law of the Commonwealth, if, from the absence of witnesses or from any other reasonable cause, it becomes necessary or advisable to defer the hearing of the case, the court before whom the accused person appears or is brought, may:

                     (a)  by warrant from time to time remand the defendant to some gaol, lock‑up, or other place of custody for such period as the court shall deem necessary to be there kept until the time appointed for continuing the hearing; or

##### <a id="15AA"></a>15AA  Bail not to be granted in certain cases

             (1)  Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a bail authority must not grant bail to a person (the **_defendant_**) charged with, or convicted of, an offence covered by subsection (2) unless the bail authority is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify bail.

             (2)  This subsection covers:

                     (a)  a terrorism offence (other than an offence against section 102.8 of the _Criminal Code_); and

                     (b)  an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, if:

                              (i)  a physical element of the offence is that the defendant engaged in conduct that caused the death of a person; and

                             (ii)  the fault element for that physical element is that the defendant intentionally engaged in that conduct (whether or not the defendant intended to cause the death, or knew or was reckless as to whether the conduct would result in the death); and

                     (c)  an offence against a provision of Division 80 or Division 91 of the _Criminal Code_, or against section 24AA of this Act, if:

                              (i)  the death of a person is alleged to have been caused by conduct that is a physical element of the offence; or

                             (ii)  conduct that is a physical element of the offence carried a substantial risk of causing the death of a person; and

                     (d)  an ancillary offence against a provision of Division 80 or Division 91 of the _Criminal Code_, or against section 24AA of this Act, if, had the defendant engaged in conduct that is a physical element of the primary offence to which the ancillary offence relates, there would have been a substantial risk that the conduct would have caused the death of a person.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, the express reference in paragraph (2)(d) to an ancillary offence does not imply that references in paragraphs (2)(a), (b) or (c) to an offence do not include references to ancillary offences.

          (3A)  Despite any law of the Commonwealth, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the defendant may appeal against a decision of a bail authority:

                     (a)  to grant bail to a person charged with or convicted of an offence covered by subsection (2) on the basis that the bail authority is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist; or

                     (b)  to refuse to grant bail to a person charged with or convicted of an offence covered by subsection (2) on the basis that the bail authority is not satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist.

          (3B)  An appeal under subsection (3A):

                     (a)  may be made to a court that would ordinarily have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals (however described) from directions, orders or judgments of the bail authority referred to in subsection (3A), whether the jurisdiction is in respect of appeals relating to bail or appeals relating to other matters; and

                     (b)  is to be made in accordance with the rules or procedures (if any) applicable under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory in relation to the exercise of such jurisdiction.

          (3C)  If:

                     (a)  a bail authority decides to grant bail to a person charged with or convicted of an offence covered by subsection (2); and

                     (b)  immediately after the decision is made, the Director of Public Prosecutions notifies the bail authority that he or she intends to appeal against the decision under subsection (3A);

the decision to grant bail is stayed with effect from the time of the notification.

          (3D)  A stay under subsection (3C) ends:

                     (a)  when a decision on the appeal is made; or

                     (b)  when the Director of Public Prosecutions notifies:

                              (i)  the bail authority; or

                             (ii)  if an appeal has already been instituted in a court—the court;

                            that he or she does not intend to proceed with the appeal; or

                     (c)  72 hours after the stay comes into effect;

whichever occurs first.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, except as provided by subsections (1), (3A), (3B), (3C) and (3D), this section does not affect the operation of a law of a State or a Territory.

Note:          These provisions indirectly affect laws of the States and Territories because they affect section 68 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="ancillari-offenc"></a>**_ancillary offence_** has the meaning given in the _Criminal Code_.

                    <a name="primari-offenc"></a>**_primary offence_** has the meaning given in the _Criminal Code_.

##### <a id="15AB"></a>15AB  Matters to be considered in certain bail applications

             (1)  In determining whether to grant bail to a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or in determining conditions to which bail granted to such a person should be subject, a bail authority:

                     (a)  must take into consideration the potential impact of granting bail on:

                              (i)  any person against whom the offence is, or was, alleged to have been committed; and

                             (ii)  any witness, or potential witness, in proceedings relating to the alleged offence, or offence; and

                     (b)  must not take into consideration any form of customary law or cultural practice as a reason for:

                              (i)  excusing, justifying, authorising, requiring or lessening the seriousness of the alleged criminal behaviour to which the alleged offence relates, or the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates; or

                             (ii)  aggravating the seriousness of the alleged criminal behaviour to which the alleged offence relates, or the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates.

             (2)  If a person referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) is living in, or otherwise located in, a remote community, the bail authority must also take into consideration that fact in considering the potential impact of granting bail on that person.

             (3)  In paragraph (1)(b):

                    <a name="crimin-behaviour"></a>**_criminal behaviour_** includes:

                     (b)  any fault element relating to such a physical element.

Note:          Subsections (1) and (2) indirectly affect laws of the States and Territories because they affect section 68 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_.

##### <a id="15A"></a>15A  Enforcement of fines etc.

             (1)  A law of a State or Territory relating to the enforcement or recovery of a fine imposed on an offender applies to a person convicted in the State or Territory of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. The law applies:

                     (a)  so far as it is not inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  with the modifications made by or under this section.

       (1AA)  If a law of a State or Territory requires or permits a person or authority other than a court to take action to impose a penalty described in subsection (1AB) for failure to pay a fine, the law applies under subsection (1) as if the law did not require or permit the person or authority to take the action but instead:

                     (a)  allowed any person to apply to a court of summary jurisdiction of the State or Territory for an order imposing the penalty; and

                     (b)  allowed the court to make the order; and

                     (c)  provided for the order to have the same effect that the taking of the action by the person or authority has under the law without the modifications made by or under this subsection; and

                     (d)  were subject to any prescribed modifications consequential on the other modifications described in this subsection, or facilitating the operation of the law with those modifications.

       (1AB)  Subsection (1AA) applies in relation to any of the following penalties:

                     (a)  garnishment of a debt, wage or salary;

                     (b)  a charge or caveat on property;

                     (c)  seizure of property;

                     (d)  forfeiture of property;

                     (e)  community service by a person who failed to pay a fine;

                      (f)  detention or imprisonment of a person who failed to pay a fine;

                     (g)  a penalty that is similar to a penalty described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f);

                     (h)  a penalty prescribed by the regulations.

       (1AC)  Jurisdiction is conferred on a court of summary jurisdiction of a State or Territory to make orders described in subsection (1AA).

       (1AD)  If a law of a State or Territory requires or permits a court or a court officer to:

                     (a)  refer a matter to a person or organisation; or

                     (b)  notify a person or organisation; or

                     (c)  provide information to a person or organisation;

in relation to the enforcement or recovery of a fine imposed by the court, the law applies under subsection (1) in relation to a federal court in the same way as it applies to a court of the State or Territory.

          (1A)  Where there is a law of a State or Territory with respect to the enforcement or recovery of fines ordered to be paid by offenders (including a law described in subsection (1AA)) that applies in relation to fines ordered to be paid by offenders convicted by courts of summary jurisdiction:

                     (a)  subsection (1) operates to require that law to apply and be applied to persons who are convicted summarily of federal offences by a federal court in the same manner as that law would apply and be applied if the federal court were a court of summary jurisdiction; and

                     (b)  that subsection does not operate in relation to any law of that State or Territory that applies in relation to fines ordered to be paid by offenders convicted by superior courts.

          (1B)  If a law of a State or Territory:

                     (a)  is with respect to the enforcement or recovery of fines ordered to be paid by offenders (including a law described in subsection (1AA)); and

                     (b)  applies in relation to fines ordered to be paid by offenders convicted on indictment;

subsection (1) operates to require that law to apply and be applied in the same manner to persons who are convicted on indictment of federal offences by a federal court.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), in the application to a person convicted of a federal offence of any State or Territory laws with respect to the enforcement or recovery of fines, a requirement that the amount of a fine be paid to a State or Territory office or officer is to be treated as a requirement that the amount of the fine be paid in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  Where a court imposes a sentence or sentences of imprisonment on a person in respect of a failure to pay a fine or fines imposed for a federal offence or offences, the court must direct that the sentence, or all the sentences, commence to be served from the earliest practicable day despite the fact that the person may, on that day, already be serving another sentence of imprisonment for a federal, State or Territory offence.

             (4)  Despite subsection (3), a court may, where it is of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the case, it is more appropriate to do so, direct that a period of imprisonment imposed on a person in respect of a failure to pay a fine imposed in respect of a federal offence commence to be served during, or at the end of, a period of imprisonment imposed for a similar failure in respect of another federal offence.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="feral-offenc"></a>**_federal offence_** means an offence against the law of the Commonwealth.

                    <a name="modif"></a>**_modifications_** includes additions, omissions and substitutions.

##### <a id="15B"></a>15B  Time for commencement of prosecutions

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1B), a prosecution of an individual for an offence against any law of the Commonwealth may be commenced as follows:

                     (a)  if the maximum penalty which may be imposed for the offence in respect of an individual is, or includes, a term of imprisonment of more than 6 months in the case of a first conviction—at any time;

                     (b)  in any other case—at any time within one year after the commission of the offence.

          (1A)  A prosecution of a body corporate for an offence against any law of the Commonwealth may be commenced as follows:

                     (a)  if the maximum penalty which may be imposed for the offence in respect of a body corporate is, or includes, a fine of more than 150 penalty units in the case of a first conviction—at any time;

                     (b)  in any other case—at any time within one year after the commission of the offence.

          (1B)  A prosecution of an individual for an offence that is taken to have been committed because of section 11.2 or 11.2A of the _Criminal Code_, or against another law of the Commonwealth dealing with aiding and abetting, in relation to an offence committed by a body corporate may be commenced as follows:

                     (a)  if the maximum penalty which may be imposed for the principal offence in respect of a body corporate is, or includes, a fine of more than 150 penalty units in the case of a first conviction—at any time;

                     (b)  in any other case—at any time within one year after the commission of the offence by the individual.

             (2)  Notwithstanding any provision in any law of the Commonwealth passed before the commencement of this Act and providing any shorter time for the commencement of the prosecution, any prosecution for an offence against the law may be commenced at any time within one year after the commission of the offence.

             (3)  Where by any law of the Commonwealth any longer time than the time provided by this section is provided for the commencement of a prosecution in respect of an offence against that law, a prosecution in respect of the offence may be commenced at any time within that longer time.

##### <a id="15C"></a>15C  Form of indictments, informations and summonses

             (1)  At the hearing of any indictment, information or summons, the court may make such amendment in the indictment, information or summons as appears to it to be desirable or to be necessary to enable the real question in dispute to be determined.

             (2)  If in any such case the court considers that the defendant has been misled by the form in which the indictment, information or summons has been made out, it may adjourn the hearing of the case for such period as it thinks fit and may make such order as to the costs of the adjournment as it thinks proper.

             (3)  The power of the court under subsection (1) shall not be exercised in cases where the court considers that the required amendments cannot be made without injustice to the defendant.

##### <a id="15E"></a>15E  Privilege of Parliament not affected

                   Nothing in this Act shall derogate from any power or privilege of either House of the Parliament or of the members or committees of either House of Parliament as existing at the commencement of this Act.

##### <a id="15F"></a>15F  Civil rights not affected

                   Nothing in this Act shall affect the right of any person aggrieved by any act or omission which is punishable as an offence against this Act to institute civil proceedings in any court in respect of such act or omission.

                     (b)  full‑time senior member;

                     (c)  part‑time senior member;

                     (d)  member.

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), the Minister must not nominate a person who holds an appointment as a part‑time senior member or a member of the Tribunal unless the person:

                     (a)  is enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or of the Australian Capital Territory; and

                     (b)  has been so enrolled for not less than 5 years.

             (3)  A nomination ceases to have effect if:

                     (a)  the nominated Tribunal member ceases to hold an appointment described in subsection (1); or

                     (b)  the Minister, by writing, withdraws the nomination.

             (4)  A nominated Tribunal member has, in relation to the performance or exercise of a function or power conferred on a nominated Tribunal member by this Act, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court has in relation to proceedings in the High Court.

### Division 2—Authorisation of controlled operations

#### Subdivision A—Authorities to conduct controlled operations

##### <a id="15GH"></a>15GH  Applications for authorities to conduct controlled operations

             (1)  An Australian law enforcement officer of a law enforcement agency may apply to an authorising officer for an authority to conduct a controlled operation on behalf of the law enforcement agency.

             (2)  An application for an authority may be made:

                     (a)  by means of a written document signed by the applicant (such an application is a **_formal application_**); or

                     (b)  if the applicant has reason to believe that the delay caused by making a formal application may affect the success of the controlled operation—orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such an application is an **_urgent application_**).

             (3)  Nothing in this Part prevents an application for an authority being made in respect of a controlled operation that has been the subject of a previous application, but in that case the subsequent application must be a formal application.

Note:          An urgent authority can be varied, but not so as to extend its duration—see sections 15GO and 15GS.

             (4)  An application (whether formal or urgent) must:

                     (a)  provide sufficient information to enable the authorising officer to decide whether or not to grant the application; and

                     (b)  state whether or not the proposed controlled operation, or any other controlled operation with respect to the same criminal activity, has been the subject of an earlier application (whether formal or urgent) for an authority or variation of an authority and, if so, whether or not the authority was given or the variation granted; and

                     (c)  state the proposed period of effect of the authority, which must not exceed:

                              (i)  in the case of a formal application—3 months; and

                             (ii)  in the case of an urgent application—7 days.

             (5)  An authorising officer may require an applicant to provide such additional information concerning the proposed controlled operation as is necessary for the proper consideration of the application.

             (6)  As soon as practicable after making an urgent application that was not made in writing, the applicant must make a written record of the application and give a copy of it to the authorising officer to whom the application was made.

##### <a id="15GI"></a>15GI  Determination of applications

             (1)  An authorising officer may, after considering an application for an authority to conduct a controlled operation, and any additional information provided under subsection 15GH(5):

                     (a)  authorise the controlled operation by granting the authority, either unconditionally or subject to conditions; or

                     (b)  refuse the application.

             (2)  An authorising officer must not grant an authority to conduct a controlled operation unless the authorising officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds:

                     (a)  that a serious Commonwealth offence or a serious State offence that has a federal aspect has been, is being or is likely to be, committed; and

                     (b)  that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity are such as to justify the conduct of a controlled operation; and

                     (c)  that any unlawful conduct involved in conducting the controlled operation will be limited to the maximum extent consistent with conducting an effective controlled operation; and

                     (d)  that the operation will be conducted in a way that ensures that, to the maximum extent possible, any illicit goods involved in the controlled operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer at the end of the controlled operation; and

                     (e)  that the proposed controlled conduct will be capable of being accounted for in a way that will enable the reporting requirements of Division 4 to be complied with; and

                      (f)  that the controlled operation will not be conducted in such a way that a person is likely to be induced to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (g)  that any conduct involved in the controlled operation will not:

                              (i)  seriously endanger the health or safety of any person; or

                             (ii)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                            (iii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; or

                            (iv)  result in significant loss of, or serious damage to, property (other than illicit goods); and

                     (h)  that any role assigned to a civilian participant in the operation is not one that could be adequately performed by a law enforcement officer.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, an authorising officer may authorise a particular controlled operation only if he or she is an authorising officer for the controlled operation within the meaning of section 15GF.

             (4)  An authority granted under this section is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="15GJ"></a>15GJ  Manner of granting authority

             (1)  An authority to conduct a controlled operation may be granted:

                     (a)  in the case of a formal application (other than a formal application referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii))—by means of a written document, signed by the authorising officer (such an authority is a **_formal authority_**); or

                     (b)  in the case of:

                              (i)  an urgent application; or

                             (ii)  a formal application, if the authorising officer is satisfied that the delay caused by granting a formal authority may affect the success of the controlled operation;

                            orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such an authority is an **_urgent authority_**).

             (2)  Nothing in this Part prevents an authority being granted in respect of a controlled operation that has been the subject of a previous authority, but in that case the subsequent authority must be a formal authority.

Note:          An urgent authority can be varied, but not so as to extend its duration—see sections 15GO and 15GS.

##### <a id="15GK"></a>15GK  Form of authority

             (1)  A formal authority must:

                     (a)  state the name and rank or position of the person granting the authority; and

                     (b)  identify the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation and, if the principal law enforcement officer is not the applicant for the authority, the name of the applicant; and

                     (c)  state that the application was a formal application; and

                     (d)  identify the nature of the criminal activity (including the suspected serious Commonwealth offences and serious State offences that have a federal aspect) in respect of which the controlled conduct is to be engaged in; and

                     (e)  state the identity of the persons authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; and

                      (f)  specify:

                              (i)  with respect to the law enforcement participants, the nature of the controlled conduct that those participants may engage in; and

                             (ii)  with respect to the civilian participants, the particular controlled conduct (if any) that each such participant may engage in; and

                     (g)  identify (to the extent known) the person or persons targeted; and

                     (h)  specify the period of effect of the authority, being a period not exceeding 3 months; and

                      (i)  specify any conditions to which the conduct of the controlled operation is subject; and

                      (j)  state the date and time when the authority is granted; and

                     (k)  identify the following details (to the extent to which they are known and are relevant):

                              (i)  the nature and quantity of any illicit goods that will be involved in the controlled operation;

                             (ii)  the foreign countries through which those goods are likely to pass in the course of the controlled operation;

                            (iii)  the place or places at which those goods are likely to be dealt with by Customs;

                            (iv)  if subparagraph (iii) does not apply—the place or places where those goods are likely to enter into Australia;

                             (v)  the time or times when, and the day or days on which, those goods are likely to be dealt with by Customs.

             (2)  An urgent authority must:

                     (a)  state the name and rank or position of the person who granted the authority; and

                     (b)  identify the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation and, if the principal law enforcement officer is not the applicant for the authority, the name of the applicant; and

                     (c)  state whether the application was a formal application or an urgent application; and

                     (d)  identify the nature of the criminal activity (including the suspected serious Commonwealth offences and serious State offences that have a federal aspect) in respect of which the controlled conduct is to be engaged in; and

                     (e)  state the identity of the persons authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; and

                      (f)  specify:

                              (i)  with respect to the law enforcement participants, the nature of the controlled conduct that those participants may engage in; and

                             (ii)  with respect to the civilian participants, the particular controlled conduct (if any) that each such participant may engage in; and

                     (g)  identify (to the extent known) the person or persons targeted; and

                     (h)  specify the period of effect of the authority, being a period not exceeding 7 days beginning on the day on which the authority was granted; and

                      (i)  specify any conditions to which the conduct of the operation is subject; and

                      (j)  state the date and time when the authority was granted.

             (3)  A person is sufficiently identified for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e) or (2)(e) if the person is identified:

                     (a)  by an assumed name under which the person is operating; or

                     (b)  by a code name or code number;

as long as the chief officer of the authorising agency for the controlled operation can match the assumed name, code name or code number to the person’s identity.

             (4)  An authority must not identify persons for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e) or (2)(e) by identifying a class of persons.

##### <a id="15GL"></a>15GL  Written record of urgent authority must be issued

                   If an authorising officer grants an urgent authority, the authorising officer must, within 7 days, issue a written record of the urgent authority that complies with subsection 15GK(2) to the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation.

##### <a id="15GM"></a>15GM  Change of principal law enforcement officer

                   If an authorising officer in relation to a controlled operation becomes satisfied that the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation ceases for any reason to have responsibility for the controlled operation:

                     (a)  the authorising officer may, by instrument in writing, nominate another person as the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  with effect from the execution of the instrument or such later time as is specified in the instrument, that other person becomes the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation.

##### <a id="15GN"></a>15GN  Commencement and duration of authorities

             (1)  An authority to conduct a controlled operation comes into force, and the controlled operation is taken to commence, at the time the authority is granted under section 15GI.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, an urgent authority is granted when the authorising officer tells the applicant that the urgent authority is granted.

Note:          An authority is granted under subsection 15GI(1). Paragraph 15GJ(1)(b) enables an authority to be granted orally in specified circumstances.

             (3)  An authority (whether formal or urgent) has effect for the period of effect specified in it under paragraph 15GK(1)(h) or (2)(h) unless:

                     (a)  it is cancelled before the end of the period of effect; or

                     (b)  in the case of a formal authority—the period of effect is extended under Subdivision B or C.

#### Subdivision B—Variation of authorities by appropriate authorising officers

##### <a id="15GO"></a>15GO  Variation of authority by appropriate authorising officer

             (1)  An appropriate authorising officer may vary an authority:

                     (a)  at any time on the authorising officer’s own initiative; or

                     (b)  on application under subsection 15GP(1).

             (2)  A variation may:

                     (a)  extend the period of effect of the authority (subject to subsections (3) and (4)); or

                     (b)  authorise additional persons to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation and specify:

                              (i)  with respect to additional law enforcement participants—the nature of the controlled conduct that those participants may engage in; and

                             (ii)  with respect to additional civilian participants—the particular controlled conduct (if any) that each such participant may engage in; or

                     (c)  provide that specified persons are no longer authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; or

                     (d)  authorise participants in the controlled operation to engage in additional or alternative controlled conduct.

             (3)  A variation cannot be made that has the effect of extending the period of effect of an urgent authority.

             (4)  A formal authority must not be varied in such a way that the period of effect of the authority will, after the variation is made, exceed 3 months (including any previous extensions).

             (5)  An authority must not be varied unless the authorising officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the variation will not authorise a significant alteration of the nature of the controlled operation concerned.

             (6)  A variation is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="15GP"></a>15GP  Application to appropriate authorising officer

             (1)  The principal law enforcement officer for a controlled operation, or any other Australian law enforcement officer acting on behalf of the principal law enforcement officer, may apply under this section to an appropriate authorising officer for a variation of an authority in respect of a matter mentioned in subsection 15GO(2).

             (2)  An application cannot be made under subsection (1) for a variation that would extend the period of effect of a formal authority in such a way that the period of effect of the authority will, after the variation is made, exceed 3 months (including any previous extensions).

             (3)  An application for the variation may be made:

                     (a)  by means of a written document that is signed by the applicant (such an application is a **_formal variation application_**); or

                     (b)  if the applicant has reason to believe that the delay caused by making a formal variation application may affect the success of the controlled operation to which the authority relates—orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such an application is an**_urgent variation application_**).

             (4)  More than one application for a variation under this section may be made in respect of the same authority. However, if an urgent variation of authority was granted as a result of an application under this section, the next application must be a formal variation application.

             (5)  The application (whether a formal variation application or an urgent variation application) must state whether or not the controlled operation has been the subject of an earlier urgent variation application under this section and, if so:

                     (a)  whether the urgent variation application was the last application under this section for a variation; and

                     (b)  whether or not the variation was granted.

             (6)  If the variation would extend the period of effect of a formal authority, the application (whether a formal variation application or an urgent variation application) must state the proposed period of the extension, which must not exceed:

                     (a)  in the case of a formal variation application—the period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 3 months (including any previous extensions); and

                     (b)  in the case of an urgent variation application—the lesser of:

                              (i)  7 days; and

                             (ii)  a period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 3 months (including any previous extensions).

             (7)  The authorising officer to whom the application is made may require the applicant to provide such information concerning the proposed variation as is necessary for the authorising officer’s proper consideration of the application.

             (8)  As soon as practicable after making an urgent variation application that was not made in writing, the applicant must make a written record of the application and give a copy of it to the authorising officer to whom the application was made.

##### <a id="15GQ"></a>15GQ  Requirements for variation of authority

             (1)  After considering an application for a variation of an authority, and any additional information provided under subsection 15GP(7), an appropriate authorising officer:

                     (a)  may vary the authority in accordance with the application, either unconditionally or subject to conditions; or

                     (b)  may refuse the application.

             (2)  An appropriate authorising officer must not vary an authority, whether on application or on the authorising officer’s own initiative, unless the authorising officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds:

                     (a)  that a serious Commonwealth offence or a serious State offence that has a federal aspect has been, is being or is likely to be, committed; and

                     (b)  that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity are such as to justify the variation; and

                     (c)  that any unlawful conduct involved in conducting the controlled operation will be limited to the maximum extent consistent with conducting an effective controlled operation; and

                     (d)  that the operation will be conducted in a way that ensures that, to the maximum extent possible, any illicit goods involved in the controlled operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer at the end of the controlled operation; and

                     (e)  that the proposed controlled conduct will be capable of being accounted for in a way that will enable the reporting requirements of Division 4 to be complied with; and

                      (f)  that the controlled operation will not be conducted in such a way that a person is likely to be induced to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (g)  that any conduct involved in the controlled operation will not:

                              (i)  seriously endanger the health or safety of any person; or

                             (ii)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                            (iii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; or

                            (iv)  result in significant loss of, or serious damage to, property (other than illicit goods); and

                     (h)  that any role assigned to a civilian participant in the operation is not one that could be adequately performed by a law enforcement officer.

##### <a id="15GR"></a>15GR  Manner of varying authority

             (1)  An authority may be varied by an appropriate authorising officer (whether on application or on the authorising officer’s own initiative) only:

                     (a)  in the case of a variation on the authorising officer’s own initiative or on a formal variation application (other than a variation referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii))—by means of a written document, signed by the authorising officer (such a variation is a **_formal variation of authority_**); or

                     (b)  in the case of a variation on:

                              (i)  an urgent variation application; or

                             (ii)  the authorising officer’s own initiative or a formal variation application, if the authorising officer is satisfied that the delay caused by granting a formal variation of authority may affect the success of the controlled operation;

                            orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such a variation is an **_urgent variation of authority_**).

             (2)  The authorising officer must, as soon as practicable, prepare and give a written document that complies with section 15GS to the applicant or, if the variation was on the initiative of the authorising officer, to the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation.

##### <a id="15GS"></a>15GS  Form of variation of authority

             (1)  A variation of an authority by an appropriate authorising officer (whether formal or urgent) must:

                     (a)  identify the controlled operation to which the authority relates; and

                     (b)  state the name and rank or position of the person varying the authority; and

                     (c)  if the authority was varied on an application made under section 15GP, state:

                              (i)  the name of the applicant; and

                             (ii)  whether the application was a formal variation application or an urgent variation application; and

                     (e)  describe the variation having regard to the matters referred to in subsection 15GO(2); and

                      (f)  if the variation extends the period of effect of a formal authority—state the period of the extension.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(f), the period of the extension must not exceed:

                     (a)  in the case of a formal variation of authority—the period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 3 months (including any previous extensions); and

                     (b)  in the case of an urgent variation of authority—the lesser of:

                              (i)  7 days; and

                             (ii)  a period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 3 months (including any previous extensions).

             (1)  The principal law enforcement officer for a controlled operation for which there is a formal authority, or any other Australian law enforcement officer acting on behalf of the principal law enforcement officer, may apply to a nominated Tribunal member for a variation of the authority that would extend its period of effect:

                     (a)  if the period of effect of the authority is 3 months or more (including any previous extensions); or

                     (b)  in such a way that the period of effect of the authority will, after the variation is made, be 3 months or more (including any previous extensions).

             (2)  An application cannot be made under subsection (1) for a variation that would extend the period of effect of a formal authority in such a way that the period of effect of the authority will, after the variation is made, exceed 24 months (including any previous extensions under this Subdivision or Subdivision B).

             (3)  An application for the variation may be made:

                     (a)  by means of a written document that is signed by the applicant (such an application is a **_formal variation application_**); or

             (4)  More than one application for a variation under this section may be made in respect of the same authority. However, if an urgent variation of authority was granted as a result of an application under this section, the next application must be a formal variation application.

             (5)  An application for a variation (whether a formal variation application or an urgent variation application) must state:

                     (a)  whether or not the controlled operation has been the subject of an earlier urgent variation application under this section and, if so:

##### <a id="15GV"></a>15GV  Determination of application

             (1)  After considering an application for a variation of a formal authority, and any additional information provided under subsection 15GU(6), the nominated Tribunal member concerned:

                     (b)  may refuse the application.

             (2)  The nominated Tribunal member must not grant the variation unless the nominated Tribunal member is satisfied on reasonable grounds:

                     (a)  that a serious Commonwealth offence or a serious State offence that has a federal aspect has been, is being or is likely to be, committed; and

                     (b)  that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity are such as to justify the variation; and

                     (c)  that any unlawful conduct involved in conducting the controlled operation will be limited to the maximum extent consistent with conducting an effective controlled operation; and

                     (d)  that the operation will be conducted in a way that ensures that, to the maximum extent possible, any illicit goods involved in the controlled operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer at the end of the controlled operation; and

                     (e)  that the proposed controlled conduct will be capable of being accounted for in a way that will enable the reporting requirements of Division 4 to be complied with; and

                      (f)  that the controlled operation will not be conducted in such a way that a person is likely to be induced to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (g)  that any conduct involved in the controlled operation will not:

                              (i)  seriously endanger the health or safety of any person; or

                             (ii)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                            (iii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; or

                            (iv)  result in significant loss of, or serious damage to, property (other than illicit goods); and

                     (h)  that any role assigned to a civilian participant in the operation is not one that could be adequately performed by a law enforcement officer.

             (3)  A variation is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="15GW"></a>15GW  Manner of varying formal authority

             (1)  A formal authority may be varied by a nominated Tribunal member only:

                     (a)  in the case of a formal variation application (other than a formal variation application referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii))—by means of a written document, signed by the nominated Tribunal member (such a variation is a **_formal variation of authority_**); or

                     (b)  in the case of:

                              (i)  an urgent variation application; or

                             (ii)  a formal variation application, if the nominated Tribunal member is satisfied that the delay caused by granting a formal variation of authority may affect the success of the controlled operation;

                            orally in person, or by telephone or any other means of communication (such a variation is an **_urgent variation of authority_**).

             (2)  The nominated Tribunal member must, as soon as practicable, prepare and give a written document that complies with section 15GX to the applicant.

##### <a id="15GX"></a>15GX  Form of variation of formal authority

             (1)  A variation of a formal authority by a nominated Tribunal member (whether formal or urgent) must:

                     (a)  identify the controlled operation to which the authority relates; and

                     (b)  state the name and position of the person varying the authority; and

                     (c)  state the name of the applicant; and

                     (d)  state whether the application for the variation was a formal variation application or an urgent variation application; and

                     (e)  state the date and time when the variation of authority is or was granted; and

                      (f)  state the period of the extension.

             (2)  The period of the extension:

                     (a)  must not exceed the period that would result in the period of effect of the authority exceeding 24 months (including any previous extensions under this Subdivision or Subdivision B); and

                     (b)  must not exceed:

                              (i)  in the case of a formal variation of authority—3 months; and

                             (ii)  in the case of an urgent variation of authority—7 days.

#### Subdivision D—Other matters

##### <a id="15GY"></a>15GY  Cancellation of authorities

             (1)  An appropriate authorising officer may, by order in writing given to the principal law enforcement officer for a controlled operation, cancel the authority to conduct the controlled operation at any time and for any reason.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), an appropriate authorising officer may cancel an authority at any time at the request of the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation concerned.

             (3)  Cancellation of an authority takes effect at the time the order is made or at the later time specified in the order.

##### <a id="15GZ"></a>15GZ  Effect of authorities

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), an authority:

                     (a)  authorises each law enforcement participant in the controlled operation to which the authority relates who is identified in the authority to engage in the controlled conduct specified in the authority in respect of that participant; and

                     (b)  authorises each civilian participant (if any) in the controlled operation to which the authority relates who is identified in the authority to engage in the particular controlled conduct (if any) specified in the authority in respect of that participant.

             (2)  A person identified in an authority as being authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation is authorised to do so for the period of effect of the authority, unless:

                     (a)  the authority specifies a shorter period during which the person is so authorised; or

                     (b)  the authority is varied to provide that the person is no longer so authorised; or

                     (c)  the authority is cancelled before the end of that period.

             (3)  The authority to engage in controlled conduct given to a participant cannot be delegated to any other person.

##### <a id="15H"></a>15H  Defect in authority

                   An application for an authority or variation of an authority, and any authority or variation of an authority granted on the basis of such an application, is not invalidated by any defect, other than a defect that affects the application, authority or variation in a material particular.

### Division 3—Protection from criminal responsibility and related provisions

#### Subdivision A—Controlled operations under this Part

##### <a id="15HA"></a>15HA  Protection from criminal responsibility for controlled conduct during controlled operations

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a participant in a controlled operation engages in conduct in the course of, and for the purposes of, the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  engaging in that conduct is a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory.

             (2)  Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the participant is not criminally responsible for the offence, if:

                     (a)  the participant engages in the conduct in accordance with the authority to conduct the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  the participant is identified in the authority as a person authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; and

                     (c)  the conduct does not involve the participant intentionally inducing a person to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (d)  the conduct does not involve the participant engaging in any conduct that is likely to:

                              (i)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                             (ii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; and

                     (e)  if the participant is a civilian participant in the operation—he or she acts in accordance with the instructions of a law enforcement officer.

##### <a id="15HB"></a>15HB  Indemnification of participants against civil liability

                   The Commonwealth must indemnify a participant in a controlled operation against any civil liability (including reasonable costs) the participant incurs because of conduct the participant engages in if:

                     (a)  the participant engages in the conduct in the course of, and for the purposes of, the controlled operation in accordance with the authority to conduct the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  the participant is identified in the authority as a person authorised to engage in controlled conduct for the purposes of the controlled operation; and

                     (c)  the conduct does not involve the participant intentionally inducing a person to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (d)  the conduct does not involve the participant engaging in any conduct that is likely to:

                              (i)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                             (ii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; and

                     (e)  if the participant is a civilian participant in the operation—he or she acts in accordance with the instructions of a law enforcement officer; and

                      (f)  the requirements (if any) specified in the regulations have been met.

##### <a id="15HC"></a>15HC  Effect of sections 15HA and 15HB on other laws relating to criminal investigation

                   Sections 15HA and 15HB do not apply to a person’s conduct that is, or could have been, authorised under Commonwealth law or a law of a State or Territory relating to the following:

                     (a)  arrest or detention of individuals;

                     (b)  searches of individuals;

                     (c)  entry onto, or searches or inspection of, premises;

                     (d)  searches, inspections or seizures of other property;

                     (e)  forensic procedure;

                      (f)  electronic surveillance devices or telecommunications interception;

                     (g)  identification procedures;

                     (h)  the acquisition or use of assumed identities;

                      (i)  any other matter concerning powers of criminal investigation.

##### <a id="15HD"></a>15HD  Effect of being unaware of variation or cancellation of authority

             (1)  If an authority to conduct a controlled operation is varied in a way that limits its scope, this Part continues to apply to a participant in the controlled operation as if the authority had not been varied in that way, for so long as the participant:

                     (a)  is unaware of the variation; and

                     (b)  is not reckless about the existence of the variation.

             (2)  If an authority to conduct a controlled operation is cancelled, this Part continues to apply to a person who was a participant in the controlled operation immediately before the cancellation as if the authority had not been cancelled in that way, for so long as the person:

                     (a)  is unaware of the cancellation; and

                     (b)  is not reckless about the existence of the cancellation.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a person is reckless about the existence of the variation or cancellation of an authority if:

                     (a)  the person is aware of a substantial risk that the variation or cancellation has happened; and

                     (b)  having regard to the circumstances known to the person, it is unjustifiable to take the risk that the authority has not been varied or cancelled.

##### <a id="15HE"></a>15HE  Protection from criminal responsibility for certain ancillary conduct

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a person engages in conduct (the**_ancillary conduct_**) that relates to controlled conduct (the **_related controlled conduct_**) engaged in by another person; and

                     (b)  engaging in the ancillary conduct is an ancillary offence in relation to the offence constituted by the related controlled conduct.

             (2)  Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the person who engaged in the ancillary conduct is not criminally responsible for the ancillary offence if, at the time the person engaged in the ancillary conduct, he or she believed the related controlled conduct was being engaged in, or would be engaged in, by a participant in a controlled operation authorised under this Part.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="ancillari-offenc"></a>**_ancillary offence_**, in relation to an offence constituted by related controlled conduct, means a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory:

                     (a)  of conspiring to commit the offence constituted by the related controlled conduct; or

                     (b)  of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring, inciting or being in any way knowingly concerned in, the commission of the offence constituted by the related controlled conduct.

##### <a id="15HF"></a>15HF  Compensation for property loss or serious damage

             (1)  If a person suffers loss of or serious damage to property, or personal injury, in the course of, or as a direct result of a controlled operation authorised under this Part, the Commonwealth is liable to pay to the person compensation as agreed between the Commonwealth and the person or, in default of agreement, as determined by action against the Commonwealth in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the person suffered the loss, damage or injury in the course of, or as a direct result of, engaging in any criminal activity (other than criminal activity that is controlled conduct); or

                     (b)  the person was a law enforcement participant at the time of suffering the loss, damage or injury.

##### <a id="15HG"></a>15HG  Notification requirements

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  any loss of or serious damage to property occurs in the course of, or as a direct result of, a controlled operation (other than property of the law enforcement agency on behalf of which the operation is conducted or a participant in the operation); or

                     (b)  any personal injury occurs in the course of, or as a direct result of, such an operation;

the principal law enforcement officer for the controlled operation must report the loss, damage or injury to the chief officer of the law enforcement agency as soon as practicable.

             (2)  If loss or serious damage to property is reported to the chief officer under subsection (1), the chief officer must take all reasonable steps to notify the owner of the property of the loss or damage.

             (3)  If a personal injury is reported to the chief officer under subsection (1), the chief officer must take all reasonable steps to notify the person that the injury occurred in the course of, or as a direct result of, the controlled operation.

             (4)  The chief officer is not required to give a notification under subsection (2) or (3) until the chief officer is satisfied that the notification would not:

                     (a)  compromise or hinder the controlled operation or any related investigation; or

                     (b)  compromise the identity of a participant in the controlled operation; or

                     (c)  endanger the life or safety of any person; or

                     (d)  prejudice any legal proceeding; or

                     (e)  otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

             (5)  A chief officer may, by written instrument, delegate any of the chief officer’s powers or functions under this section to:

                     (a)  in relation to the Australian Federal Police—a Deputy Commissioner or a person of equivalent or higher rank; or

                     (b)  in relation to Customs—a Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Customs or a person occupying an equivalent or higher position; or

                     (b)  engaging in that conduct is a Commonwealth offence.

             (2)  Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, the participant is not criminally responsible for the Commonwealth offence, if:

                     (a)  the conduct is authorised by, and is engaged in in accordance with, the authority to conduct the controlled operation; and

                     (b)  the conduct does not involve the participant intentionally inducing a person to commit a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory that the person would not otherwise have intended to commit; and

                     (c)  the conduct does not involve the participant engaging in any conduct that is likely to:

                              (i)  cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

                             (ii)  involve the commission of a sexual offence against any person; and

                     (d)  if the person is a civilian participant in the operation—he or she acts in accordance with the instructions of a law enforcement officer.

             (3)  Expressions used in this section have the same meanings as in the corresponding State controlled operations law under which the operation was authorised.

##### <a id="15HI"></a>15HI  Effect of section 15HH on other laws relating to criminal investigation

                   Section 15HH does not apply to a person’s conduct that is, or could have been, authorised under a Commonwealth law or a law of a State or Territory relating to the following:

                              (i)  was engaged in by another person; and

                             (ii)  constitutes an offence for which a person would, but for section 15HH, be criminally responsible; and

                     (b)  engaging in the ancillary conduct is an ancillary offence (within the meaning of the _Criminal Code_) in relation to the offence constituted by the related conduct.

then the person is sufficiently identified for the purposes of paragraphs (2A)(b) and (2B)(b) if the person is identified:

             (2)  Each chief officer must advise the Minister of any information in a report that, in the chief officer’s opinion, should be excluded from the report before the report is laid before the Parliament because:

                             (ii)  prejudice an investigation or prosecution; or

                            (iii)  compromise any law enforcement agency’s operational activities or methodologies; or

             (5)  A report must not disclose any information that identifies any person involved in an operation or that is likely to lead to such a person being identified.

             (6)  Nothing in this section requires particulars of a controlled operation to be included in a report for a year if the operation had not been completed as at 30 June in that year, but the particulars must instead be included in the report for the year in which the operation is completed.

             (7)  If a report relates, in whole or in part, to the work or activities of the ACC under a corresponding State controlled operations law, the Minister must, as soon as practicable after the report is laid before each House of the Parliament, send a copy of the report to the State or Territory Minister with responsibility for the corresponding State controlled operations law.

                     (d)  by a code name or code number;

as long as the chief officer can match the assumed name, code name or code number to the person’s identity.

             (3)  A register kept under this section is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="15HV"></a>15HV  Ombudsman to be given information and access despite other laws

             (1)  Despite any other law, a person is not excused from giving information, answering a question, or giving access to a document, as and when required under this Division, on the ground that giving the information, answering the question, or giving access to the document, as the case may be:

                     (a)  would contravene a law; or

                     (b)  would be contrary to the public interest; or

                     (c)  might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty; or

                     (d)  would disclose one of the following:

                              (i)  a legal advice given to a Minister, a Department or a prescribed authority;

                             (ii)  a communication between an officer of a Department or of a prescribed authority and another person or body, being a communication protected against disclosure by legal professional privilege.

             (2)  However, if the person is a natural person:

is not admissible in evidence against the person except in a proceeding by way of a prosecution for an offence against section 15HK or 15HL of this Act or Part 7.4 or 7.7 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (3)  Nothing in section 15HK or 15HL or in any other law prevents an officer of an agency from:

                     (a)  giving information to an inspecting officer (whether orally or in writing and whether or not in answer to a question); or

                     (b)  giving access to a record of the agency to an inspecting officer;

for the purposes of an inspection under this Division of the agency’s records.

             (4)  Nothing in section 15HK or 15HL or in any other law prevents an officer of an agency from making a record of information, or causing a record of information to be made, for the purposes of giving the information to a person as permitted by subsection (3).

             (5)  The fact that a person is not excused under subsection (1) from giving information, answering a question or giving access to a document does not otherwise affect a claim of legal professional privilege that anyone may make in relation to that information, answer or document.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="prescrib-author"></a>**_prescribed authority_** has the same meaning as in the _Ombudsman Act 1976_.

             (2)  The Ombudsman may give information that:

                     (a)  relates to a State or Territory agency; and

                     (b)  was obtained by the Ombudsman under this Division;

to the State or Territory inspecting authority in relation to the agency.

             (3)  The Ombudsman may only give information to an authority under subsection (2) if the Ombudsman is satisfied that the giving of the information is necessary to enable the authority to perform its functions in relation to the State or Territory agency.

             (4)  The Ombudsman may receive from a State or Territory inspecting authority information relevant to the performance of the Ombudsman’s functions under this Division.

##### <a id="15HX"></a>15HX  Delegation by Ombudsman

##### <a id="15HY"></a>15HY  Ombudsman not to be sued

                   The Ombudsman, an inspecting officer, or a person acting under an inspecting officer’s direction or authority, is not liable to an action, suit or proceeding for or in relation to an act done, or omitted to be done, in good faith in the performance or exercise, or the purported performance or exercise, of a function or power conferred by this Division.

                     (b)  may refuse the application.

             (2)  An authority to acquire or use an assumed identity may not be granted unless the chief officer is satisfied on reasonable grounds:

                     (a)  that the assumed identity is necessary for one or more of the following purposes:

                              (i)  investigation of, or intelligence gathering in relation to, criminal activity (whether a particular criminal activity or criminal activity generally);

                             (ii)  the exercise of powers and performance of functions of an intelligence agency;

                            (iii)  the exercise of powers and performance of functions for the purposes of the National Witness Protection Program;

                     (b)  that the risk of abuse of the assumed identity by the authorised person is minimal; and

                     (c)  if the application is for authorisation of an assumed identity for a person who is not an officer  of either an intelligence agency or a law enforcement agency—that it would be impossible or impracticable in the circumstances for an officer to acquire or use the assumed identity for the purpose sought.

             (3)  If an authority is granted for an authorised civilian, the chief officer must appoint an officer of the law enforcement agency or the intelligence agency (as the case may be) to supervise the acquisition or use of the assumed identity by the authorised civilian.

             (4)  The officer appointed as supervisor must be:

                     (a)  in the case of the Australian Federal Police—a person who holds the rank of sergeant or an equivalent or higher rank; or

                      (f)  in the case of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation—a person who holds the position, or performs the duties, of an ASIO Executive Officer Level 1 position, or an equivalent or higher position, in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; or

                     (g)  in the case of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service—an intelligence officer of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service who is determined by the Director‑General of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service.

             (5)  An authority may also authorise any one or more of the following:

                     (a)  an application of a kind referred to in section 15KG for an order for an entry in a register of births, deaths or marriages under a corresponding assumed identity law;

                     (b)  a request under section 15KI or 15KX;

                     (c)  the use of an assumed identity in a foreign country.

Note:          Section 15KW modifies the effect of this provision if control of the authority is transferred.

### Division 4—Effect of Authority

##### <a id="15KP"></a>15KP  Assumed identity may be acquired and used

                   A person may acquire or use an assumed identity if:

                     (a)  the person is an authorised person (other than an authorised civilian) and the acquisition or use is:

                              (i)  in accordance with an authority; and

                             (ii)  in the course of duty; or

                     (b)  the person is an authorised civilian and the acquisition or use is in accordance with:

                              (i)  an authority; and

                             (ii)  any direction by the person’s supervisor under the authority.

##### <a id="15KQ"></a>15KQ  Protection from criminal liability—authorised persons

                   If an authorised person does something  that, apart from this section, would be a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory, the person is not criminally responsible for the offence if:

                     (b)  the thing is done:

                              (i)  in the case of an authorised intelligence officer, an authorised law enforcement officer or an authorised foreign officer—in the course of his or her duty; or

                             (ii)  in the case of an authorised civilian—in accordance with any direction by his or her supervisor under the authority; and

                     (c)  doing the thing would not be an offence if the assumed identity were the person’s real identity.

##### <a id="15KR"></a>15KR  Protection from criminal liability—third parties

                   If a person does something that, apart from this section, would be a Commonwealth offence or an offence under a law of a State or Territory, the person is not criminally responsible for the offence if:

                     (a)  the person is a Commonwealth officer; and

                     (b)  the thing is done in the course of the person’s duty; and

                     (c)  the chief officer who granted the authority has authorised the doing of the thing; and

                     (d)  if an authorised person had done the thing in accordance with an authority, the authorised person would not have been criminally responsible for the offence because of the application of section 15KQ.

##### <a id="15KS"></a>15KS  Indemnity for authorised persons

             (1)  This section applies if the chief officer of either a law enforcement agency or an intelligence agency grants an authority.

             (2)  The Commonwealth must indemnify the authorised person under the authority for any liability incurred by the person (including reasonable costs) because of something done by the person  if:

                     (b)  the person does not have that qualification.

             (2)  Subsection (1) applies whether or not the person has acquired, as evidence of an assumed identity, a document that indicates that he or she has that qualification.

Example:    An officer who cannot fly a plane is not authorised to fly even though he or she has acquired a pilot’s licence under an assumed identity.

##### <a id="15KU"></a>15KU  Effect of being unaware of variation or cancellation of authority

             (1)  If an authority has been varied in a way that limits its scope, this Part continues to apply to the authorised person to whom it relates as if it had not been varied in that way, for as long as the person:

                     (b)  is not reckless about the existence of the variation.

             (2)  If an authority has been cancelled, this Part continues to apply to the authorised person to whom it related as if it had not been cancelled, for as long as the person:

                     (a)  is unaware of the cancellation; and

                     (b)  is not reckless about the existence of the cancellation.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a person is reckless about the existence of the variation or cancellation of an authority or authorisation if:

                     (a)  the person is aware of a substantial risk that the variation or cancellation has happened; and

                     (b)  having regard to the circumstances known to the person, it is unjustifiable to take the risk that the authority has not been varied or cancelled.

##### <a id="15KV"></a>15KV  Transfer of control of authorities

             (1)  The chief officer of an intelligence agency (the **_originating agency_**) may agree in writing with the chief officer of another intelligence agency (the **_receiving agency_**) to transfer control of an authority to the chief officer of the receiving agency if:

                     (a)  the authority was granted by the chief officer of the originating agency; or

                     (b)  control of the authority was transferred to the chief officer of the originating agency under a previous application of this subsection.

Note:          The chief officer may delegate functions under this section—see section 15LH.

             (2)  The chief officer of a law enforcement agency (the **_originating agency_**) may agree in writing with the chief officer of another law enforcement agency (the **_receiving agency_**) to transfer control of an authority to the chief officer of the receiving agency if:

                     (a)  the authority was granted by the chief officer of the originating agency; or

                     (b)  control of the authority was transferred to the chief officer of the originating agency under a previous application of this subsection.

Note:          The chief officer may delegate functions under this section—see section 15LH.

             (3)  The chief officer of the originating agency must give the chief officer of the receiving agency a written document setting out:

                     (a)  whether the authority has been reviewed under section 15KF, and if so, when a review was last conducted; and

                     (b)  whether control of the authority has previously been transferred under this section, and if so:

                              (i)  the date of each such transfer; and

                             (ii)  the name of the originating agency and receiving agency in relation to each such transfer.

             (4)  Control of the authority is transferred at the time when the chief officer of the receiving agency signs and dates a copy of the authority.

             (5)  Despite subsection (4), if the authority relates to an authorised civilian, control of the authority is not transferred until the chief officer of the receiving agency appoints an officer of that agency to be the authorised civilian’s supervisor.

             (6)  The chief officer of the receiving agency must vary the authority in accordance with section 15KE to state the name of the supervisor appointed under subsection (5).

             (7)  Control of an authority must not be transferred under this section if:

                     (a)  the person who is to acquire or use the assumed identity, or who has acquired or used the assumed identity, is a foreign officer authorised to acquire or use the assumed identity by the chief officer of a law enforcement agency; or

                     (b)  the assumed identity is to be, is being or has been used in a foreign country and the authority was granted by the chief officer of a law enforcement agency.

##### <a id="15KW"></a>15KW  Consequences of transfer of control of authorities

             (1)  This section sets out the consequences of the transfer of control of an authority under section 15KV.

             (2)  The authority continues to be in force after the transfer.

             (3)  The following provisions have effect, after the transfer, as if the chief officer of the receiving agency had granted the authority instead of the chief officer of the originating agency:

                     (a)  section 15KE (which deals with variation and cancellation of authorities);

                     (b)  section 15KF (which deals with review of authorities);

                     (c)  sections 15KI and 15KX (which deal with requests for evidence of assumed identities).

             (4)  To avoid doubt, the obligation under section 15KF, as that section has effect because of subsection (3), for the chief officer of the receiving agency to review the authority, only arises:

                     (a)  in the case of an authority transferred under subsection 15KV(1):

                              (i)  3 years after the last review of the authority by the chief officer of an intelligence agency; or

                             (ii)  if no such review has been undertaken—3 years after the authority was granted; and

                     (b)  in the case of an authority transferred under subsection 15KV(2):

                              (i)  12 months after the last review of the authority by the chief officer of a law enforcement agency; or

                             (ii)  if no such review has been undertaken—12 months after the authority was granted.

             (5)  Section 15KL (which deals with cancellation of evidence of assumed identity) has effect as if the chief officer of the receiving agency had made the request under section 15KI.

                     (b)  give evidence of the assumed identity to the following:

                              (i)  the authorised person named in the authority;

                             (ii)  an officer of the law enforcement agency or the intelligence agency who is named in the request.

Note 1:       The chief officer may delegate functions under this section—see section 15LH.

Note 2:       Section 15KW modifies the effect of this provision if control of the authority is transferred.

             (3)  The request must state that it is a request under this section.

             (4)  A request must not be made under this section for an entry in a register of births, deaths or marriages.

                     (a)  the liability is incurred because of something done in the course of duty by the issuing agency or the officer of the issuing agency to comply with the request; and

                     (b)  any requirements prescribed under the regulations have been met.

### Division 2—General sentencing principles

##### <a id="16A"></a>16A  Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc.

             (1)  In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.

             (2)  In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:

                     (a)  the nature and circumstances of the offence;

                     (b)  other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account;

                     (c)  if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character—that course of conduct;

                     (d)  the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence;

                     (e)  any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;

                      (f)  the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence:

                              (i)  by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; or

                             (ii)  in any other manner;

                    (fa)  the extent to which the person has failed to comply with:

                              (i)  any order under subsection 23CD(1) of the _Federal Court of Australia Act 1976_; or

                             (ii)  any obligation under a law of the Commonwealth; or

                            (iii)  any obligation under a law of the State or Territory applying under subsection 68(1) of the _Judiciary Act 1903_;

                            about pre‑trial disclosure, or ongoing disclosure, in proceedings relating to the offence;

                     (g)  if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence—that fact;

                     (h)  the degree to which the person has co‑operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences;

                      (j)  the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person;

                     (k)  the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence;

                    (m)  the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person;

                     (n)  the prospect of rehabilitation of the person;

                     (p)  the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants.

          (2A)  However, the court must not take into account under subsection (1) or (2) any form of customary law or cultural practice as a reason for:

                     (a)  excusing, justifying, authorising, requiring or lessening the seriousness of the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates; or

                     (b)  aggravating the seriousness of the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates.

          (2B)  In subsection (2A):

                    <a name="crimin-behaviour"></a>**_criminal behaviour_** includes:

                     (a)  any conduct, omission to act, circumstance or result that is, or forms part of, a physical element of the offence in question; and

                     (b)  any fault element relating to such a physical element.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsections (1) and (2), in determining whether a sentence or order under subsection 19B(1), 20(1) or 20AB(1) is the appropriate sentence or order to be passed or made in respect of a federal offence, the court must have regard to the nature and severity of the conditions that may be imposed on, or may apply to, the offender, under that sentence or order.

             (4)  For the purposes of a reference in this section to a family, the members of a person’s family are taken to include the following (without limitation):

                     (a)  a de facto partner of the person;

                     (b)  someone who is the child of the person, or of whom the person is the child, because of the definition of **_child_** in section 3;

                     (c)  anyone else who would be a member of the person’s family if someone mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) is taken to be a member of the person’s family.

##### <a id="16B"></a>16B  Court to have regard to other periods of imprisonment required to be served

                   In sentencing a person convicted of a federal offence, a court must have regard to:

                     (a)  any sentence already imposed on the person by the court or another court for any other federal offence or for any State or Territory offence, being a sentence that the person has not served; and

                     (b)  any sentence that the person is liable to serve because of the revocation of a parole order made, or licence granted, under this Part or under a law of a State or Territory.

##### <a id="16BA"></a>16BA  Taking other offences into account

             (1)  Where a person is convicted of a federal offence or federal offences, and the court before which the person is convicted is satisfied that:

                     (a)  there has been filed in the court a document in, or to the effect of, the form prescribed for the purposes of this section;

                     (b)  the document contains a list of other federal offences, or offences against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, which the person convicted is believed to have committed;

                     (c)  the document has been signed:

                              (i)  by the Director of Public Prosecutions;

                             (ii)  for and on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, by a person authorized by the Director of Public Prosecutions, by instrument in writing, to sign documents under this subsection; or

                            (iii)  by a person appointed under section 69 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_ to prosecute indictable federal offences;

                            and by the person convicted;

                     (d)  a copy of the document has been given to the person; and

                     (e)  in all the circumstances it is proper to do so;

the court may, with the consent of the prosecutor and before passing sentence on the person, ask him or her whether he or she admits his or her guilt in respect of all or any of the offences specified in the list and wishes them to be taken into account by the court in passing sentence on him or her for the offence or offences of which he or she has been convicted.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if the person admits his or her guilt in respect of all or any of the offences specified in the list and wishes to have them taken into account by the court in passing sentence on him or her for the offence or offences of which he or she has been convicted, the court may, if it thinks fit, in passing sentence on him or her for the offence or offences of which he or she has been convicted, take into account all or any of the offences in respect of which the person has admitted his or her guilt.

             (3)  The court shall not take into account under this section any indictable offence that it would not have jurisdiction to try even if the defendant consented to the court hearing and determining proceedings for the offence or the prosecutor requested the court to hear and determine those proceedings.

          (3A)  Subsection (3) does not prevent a court from taking into account an indictable offence where the court has jurisdiction to sentence a person charged with that offence.

             (4)  Where the court takes into account under this section all or any of the offences in respect of which the person has admitted his or her guilt, the sentence passed on him or her for any of the offences of which he or she has been convicted shall not exceed the maximum penalty that the court would have been empowered to impose on him or her for the offence if no offence had been so taken into account.

             (5)  Where an offence is taken into account under this section, the court may make such orders with respect to reparation, restitution, compensation, costs and forfeiture as it would have been empowered to make if the person had been convicted before the court of the offence, but shall not otherwise impose any separate punishment for the offence.

             (6)  Where the court makes an order under subsection (5) in respect of an offence taken into account under this section, there shall be such rights of appeal in respect of the order as there would have been if the order had been an order made upon the conviction of the person for that offence.

             (7)  An order made under subsection (5) in respect of an offence taken into account under this section lapses, by force of this subsection, if the conviction or each conviction, as the case may be, in respect of which the offence was taken into account is quashed or set aside.

             (8)  Where an offence is taken into account under this section, the court shall certify, upon the document filed in the court, the offence taken into account and the conviction or convictions in respect of which the offence was taken into account and thereafter no proceedings shall be taken or continued in respect of the offence unless the conviction or each conviction, as the case may be, in respect of which the offence has been taken into account has been quashed or set aside.

             (9)  An admission of guilt made under and for the purposes of this section is not admissible in evidence in any proceedings taken or continued in respect of the offence in respect of which the admission was made or in respect of any other offence specified in the list contained in the document filed in the court.

           (10)  An offence taken into account under this section shall not, by reason of its so being taken into account, be regarded for any purpose as an offence of which a person has been convicted.

           (11)  In or in relation to any criminal proceeding, reference may lawfully be made to, or evidence may lawfully be given of, the fact that an offence was taken into account under this section in passing sentence for an offence for which a person was convicted if, in or in relation to that proceeding:

                     (a)  reference may lawfully be made to, or evidence may lawfully be given of, the fact that the person was convicted of the last‑mentioned offence; and

                     (b)  had the person been convicted of the offence so taken into account, reference could lawfully have been made to, or evidence could lawfully have been given of, the fact that the person had been convicted of that offence.

           (12)  The fact that an offence was taken into account under this section may be proved in the same manner as the conviction or any of the convictions, as the case may be, in relation to which it was taken into account may be proved.

##### <a id="16C"></a>16C  Fines

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), before imposing a fine on a person for a federal offence, a court must take into account the financial circumstances of the person, in addition to any other matters that the court is required or permitted to take into account.

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) prevents a court from imposing a fine on a person because the financial circumstances of the offender cannot be ascertained by the court.

##### <a id="16D"></a>16D  No corporal punishment

             (1)  A court must not impose any form of corporal punishment for a federal offence.

             (2)  A person serving a federal sentence must not be subjected to any form of corporal punishment.

### Division 3—Sentences of imprisonment

##### <a id="16E"></a>16E  Commencement of sentences

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the law of a State or Territory relating to the commencement of sentences and of non‑parole periods applies to a person who is sentenced in that State or Territory for a federal offence in the same way as it applies to a person who is sentenced in that State or Territory for a State or Territory offence.

             (2)  Where the law of a State or Territory has the effect that a sentence imposed on a person for an offence against the law of that State or Territory or a non‑parole period fixed in respect of that sentence:

                     (a)  may be reduced by the period that the person has been in custody for the offence; or

                     (b)  is to commence on the day on which the person was taken into custody for the offence;

the law applies in the same way to a federal sentence imposed on a person in that State or Territory or to a non‑parole period fixed in respect of that sentence.

             (3)  Where the law of a State or Territory does not have the effect mentioned in subsection (2), a court (including a federal court) in that State or Territory that imposes a federal sentence on a person or fixes a non‑parole period in respect of such a sentence must take into account any period that the person has spent in custody in relation to the offence concerned.

##### <a id="16F"></a>16F  Court to explain sentence

             (1)  Where a court imposes a federal sentence on a person and fixes a non‑parole period in respect of the sentence, it must explain or cause to be explained to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the purpose and consequences of fixing that non‑parole period including, in particular, an explanation:

                     (a)  that service of the sentence will entail a period of imprisonment of not less than the non‑parole period and, if a parole order is made, a period of service in the community, called the parole period, to complete service of the sentence; and

                     (b)  that, if a parole order is made, the order will be subject to conditions; and

                     (c)  that the parole order may be amended or revoked; and

                     (d)  of the consequences that may follow if the person fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfil those conditions.

             (2)  Where a court imposes a federal sentence on a person and makes a recognizance release order in respect of that sentence, it must explain or cause to be explained to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the purpose and consequences of making the recognizance release order including, in particular, an explanation:

                     (a)  that service of the sentence will entail a period of imprisonment equal to the pre‑release period (if any) specified in the order and a period of service in the community equal to the balance of the sentence; and

                     (b)  of the conditions to which the order is subject; and

                     (c)  of the consequences that may follow if the person fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfil those conditions; and

                     (d)  that any recognizance given in accordance with the order may be discharged or varied under section 20AA.

##### <a id="17A"></a>17A  Restriction on imposing sentences

             (1)  A court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment on any person for a federal offence, or for an offence against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, unless the court, after having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.

             (2)  Where a court passes a sentence of imprisonment on a person for a federal offence, or for an offence against the law of an external Territory that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, the court:

                     (a)  shall state the reasons for its decision that no other sentence is appropriate; and

                     (b)  shall cause those reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

             (3)  The failure of a court to comply with the provisions of this section does not invalidate any sentence.

             (4)  This section applies subject to any contrary intention in the law creating the offence.

##### <a id="17B"></a>17B  Restriction on imposing sentences for certain minor offences

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of one or more section 17B offences relating to property, money or both, whose total value is not more than $2,000; and

                     (b)  the person has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment for any federal, State or Territory offence;

the court convicting the person is not to pass a sentence of imprisonment for that offence, or for any of those offences, unless the court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances that warrant it.

             (2)  In calculating the total value for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a section 17B offence which the court, with the consent of the person charged, has taken into account in passing sentence on the person for another federal offence (whether a section 17B offence or not) is taken to be an offence of which the person is convicted.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="section-17b-offenc"></a>**_section 17B offence_** means an offence against section 29 of this Act, an offence against section 131.1, 132.1, 132.6, 132.7, 134.1, 134.2, 135.1, 135.2, 135.4, 145.4 or 145.5 of the _Criminal Code_ or an offence against a provision of a federal law prescribed for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Sentence of imprisonment

             (1)  Where imprisonment is imposed in respect of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth it may (unless the contrary intention appears in the law) be imposed either with or without hard labour.

             (2)  Where under the law of a State or Territory a convicted person may in particular cases be imprisoned in a particular kind or class of prison, a person convicted of an offence against the law of the Commonwealth may, in corresponding cases, be imprisoned in the kind or class of prison appropriate to the circumstances.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Cumulative, partly cumulative or concurrent sentences

             (1)  Where a person who is convicted of a federal offence or federal offences is at the time of that conviction or those convictions, serving, or subject to, one or more federal, State or Territory sentences, the court must, when imposing a federal sentence for that federal offence, or for each of those federal offences, by order direct when the federal sentence commences, but so that:

                     (a)  no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and

                     (b)  if a non‑parole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences—the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that non‑parole period commences immediately after the end of the period.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of 2 or more federal offences at the same sitting; and

                     (b)  the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences;

the court must, by order, direct when each sentence commences, but so that no sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or of the last to end of those sentences.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  a person is convicted of a federal offence or offences, and a State or Territory offence or offences, at the same sitting; and

                     (b)  the person is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one of the offences;

the court must, by order, direct when each federal sentence commences but so that:

                     (c)  no federal sentence commences later than the end of the sentences the commencement of which has already been fixed or the last to end of those sentences; and

                     (d)  if a non‑parole period applies in respect of any State or Territory sentences—the first federal sentence to commence after the end of that non‑parole period commences immediately after the end of the period.

             (4)  For the purpose of fixing the commencement of a sentence under this section, a reference in this section to a sentence the commencement of which has already been fixed includes a reference to another sentence imposed at the same time as the first‑mentioned sentence.

##### <a id="19A"></a>19A  Detention of person in State or Territory prisons

                   A federal offender who is ordered by a court or a prescribed authority to be detained in prison in a State or Territory, may be detained in any prison in that State or Territory and may be removed from one prison to another prison in that State or Territory as if the person were detained as a State offender or Territory offender.

##### <a id="19AA"></a>19AA  Remissions and reductions of sentences

             (1)  A law of a State or Territory that provides for the remission or reduction of State or Territory sentences (other than such part of the law as relates to the remission or reduction of non‑parole periods of imprisonment or of periods of imprisonment equivalent to pre‑release periods of imprisonment in respect of recognizance release orders) applies in the same way to the remission or reduction of a federal sentence in a prison of that State or Territory, being a sentence imposed after the commencement of this section.

             (2)  Where a law of a State or Territory provides that a person is to be taken to be serving a State or Territory sentence during the period from the time of release under a parole order or licence (however called) until the parole order or licence is, or is taken to be, revoked, the law:

                     (a)  is, for the purposes of subsection (1), to be taken to be providing for the remission or reduction of sentences; and

                     (b)  applies to any calculation of the part of a federal sentence remaining to be served at the time of a federal offender’s release under a federal parole order or licence as if the sentence were a State or Territory sentence.

             (3)  Where a federal offender who is released on parole or licence and whose parole order or licence has subsequently been revoked does not get the benefit of subsection (2) in calculating the part of any federal sentence of imprisonment remaining to be served at the time of release:

                     (a)  a court fixing a new non‑parole period in respect of such a person under section 19AR; or

                     (b)  a prescribed authority fixing a non‑parole period in respect of such a person under section 19AW;

must have regard to the period of time spent by the person on parole or licence before that parole order or licence is revoked or is to be taken to have been revoked.

             (4)  A law of a State or Territory that provides for the remission or reduction, by reason of industrial action taken by prison warders, of the non‑parole period of a State or Territory sentence applies in the same way to the remission or reduction:

                     (a)  of a federal non‑parole period to be served in a prison in that State or Territory; and

                     (b)  of a federal pre‑release period to be served in that State or Territory.

this section applies.

             (2)  Where this section applies, the court must, after considering the relevant circumstances, including:

             (3)  Where, under paragraph (2)(e), the court makes a new recognizance release order, that order:

             (1)  Where a court is required to fix a non‑parole period or make a recognizance release order in respect of a federal sentence or sentences, the court must fix a non‑parole period that ends, or make a recognizance release order such that the pre‑release period ends, not later than the end of the sentence, or of the last to be served of the sentences, as reduced by any remissions or reductions under section 19AA.

             (2)  This section does not restrict the length of the non‑parole period or the pre‑release period in respect of a life sentence or sentences that include such a sentence.

##### <a id="19AG"></a>19AG  Non‑parole periods for sentences for certain offences

             (1)  This section applies if a person is convicted of one of the following offences (each of which is a **_minimum non‑parole offence_**) and a court imposes a sentence for the offence:

                     (a)  an offence against section 24AA;

                     (b)  a terrorism offence;

                     (c)  an offence against Division 80 or 91 of the _Criminal Code_.

Note:          A sentence for a minimum non‑parole offence is a federal sentence, because such an offence is a federal offence.

             (2)  The court must fix a single non‑parole period of at least 3/4 of:

                     (a)  the sentence for the minimum non‑parole offence; or

                     (b)  if 2 or more sentences have been imposed on the person for minimum non‑parole offences—the aggregate of those sentences.

The non‑parole period is in respect of all federal sentences the person is to serve or complete.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2):

                     (a)  a sentence of imprisonment for life for a minimum non‑parole offence is taken to be a sentence of imprisonment for 30 years for the offence; and

                     (b)  it does not matter:

                              (i)  whether or not the sentences mentioned in that subsection were imposed at the same sitting; or

                             (ii)  whether or not the convictions giving rise to those sentences were at the same sitting; or

                            (iii)  whether or not all the federal sentences mentioned in that subsection are for minimum non‑parole offences.

             (4)  If the person was subject to a recognizance release order, the non‑parole period supersedes the order.

             (5)  Sections 19AB, 19AC, 19AD, 19AE and 19AR have effect subject to this section.

Note:          The effects of this include preventing a court from:

(a)           making a recognizance release order under paragraph 19AB(1)(e) or (2)(e), 19AE(2)(e) or 19AR(2)(e); or

(b)           confirming (under paragraph 19AD(2)(d)) a pre‑existing non‑parole period; or

(c)           confirming (under paragraph 19AE(2)(d)) a recognizance release order; or

(d)           declining (under subsection 19AB(3) or 19AC(1) or (2) or paragraph 19AD(2)(f)) to fix a non‑parole period.

##### <a id="19AH"></a>19AH  Failure to fix non‑parole period or make recognizance release order

             (1)  Where a court fails to fix, or properly to fix, a non‑parole period, or to make, or properly to make, a recognizance release order, under this Act:

                     (a)  that failure does not affect the validity of any sentence imposed on a person; and

                     (b)  the court must, at any time, on application by the Attorney‑General, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the person, by order, set aside any non‑parole period or recognizance release order that was not properly fixed or made and fix a non‑parole period or make a recognizance release order under this Act.

             (2)  A court shall not, for the purposes of subsection (1), be taken to have failed to fix a non‑parole period in respect of a sentence or sentences in respect of which it has made a recognizance release order or to have failed to make a recognizance release order in respect of a sentence or sentences in respect of which it has fixed a non‑parole period.

             (3)  Application under subsection (1) to the court that has sentenced a person may be dealt with by that court whether or not it is constituted in the way in which it was constituted when the person was sentenced.

##### <a id="19AJ"></a>19AJ  Court may only fix non‑parole periods or make recognizance release orders for federal sentences of imprisonment

                   This Division does not authorise a court to fix a single non‑parole period, or make a recognizance release order, in respect both of federal sentences of imprisonment and State or Territory sentences of imprisonment.

##### <a id="19AK"></a>19AK  Possible deportation no impediment to fixing non‑parole period

                   Where a person is convicted of a federal offence, a court is not precluded from fixing a non‑parole period in respect of the sentence imposed for that offence merely because the person is, or may be, liable to be deported from Australia.

             (5)  A parole order directing that a person be released from prison is sufficient authority for the release if, and only if, the person indicates, in writing, his or her acceptance of the conditions to which the order is subject by certifying to that effect either on the original parole order or on a copy of that order.

##### <a id="19AM"></a>19AM  Person not to be released on parole if still serving State or Territory sentence

                     (d)  if one of the outstanding sentences is a sentence of life imprisonment or the new sentence or sentences and the unserved part of the outstanding sentence or sentences aggregate more than 3 years—the court imposing the new sentence or sentences must fix a single new non‑parole period in respect of the new sentence or sentences and the outstanding sentence or sentences; and

                     (e)  if the new sentence or sentences and the unserved part of the outstanding sentence or sentences aggregate 3 years or less—the court imposing the new sentence or sentences must not fix a non‑parole period but may make a recognizance release order in respect of the new sentence or sentences and the outstanding sentence or sentences;

and, in doing so, the court must have regard to the total period of imprisonment that the person is liable to serve.

             (4)  Where, but for this subsection, the court would be required by subsection (1), (2) or (3) to fix a non‑parole period, the court is not required to do so if it is satisfied, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence or offences concerned and to the antecedents of the offender, that it is not appropriate to do so.

             (5)  Where a court decides, under this section, that it is inappropriate either to fix a non‑parole period, or to make a recognizance release order, the court:

                     (a)  must state its reasons for so deciding; and

                     (b)  must cause these reasons to be entered in the records of the court.

                     (b)  the manner in which he or she is dealt with had been a sentence passed upon that conviction.

             (9)  Nothing in this section shall be taken to prevent a sentence passed, or an order made, under subsection 20AB(1) being revoked or varied under the applied provisions otherwise than for a failure to comply with the sentence or order or with any requirements made in relation to the sentence or order by or under the applied provisions.

           (10)  A pecuniary penalty imposed on a person by virtue of paragraph (6)(a) shall, for the purposes of the laws of the Commonwealth, and of the States and Territories, with respect to the enforcement and recovery of fines ordered to be paid by offenders, be deemed to be a fine imposed on the person upon his or her conviction for a federal offence.

### Division 6—Unfitness to be tried

##### <a id="20B"></a>20B  Consequences of preliminary finding that person unfit to be tried

             (1)  Where, in proceedings for the commitment of a person for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences, the question of the person’s fitness to be tried in respect of the offence, is raised by the prosecution, the person or the person’s legal representative, the magistrate must refer the proceedings to the court to which the proceedings would have been referred had the person been committed for trial.

             (2)  If the court to which the proceedings have been referred finds the person charged to be fit to be tried, the court must remit the proceedings to the magistrate and proceedings for the commitment must be continued as soon as practicable.

             (3)  Where a court:

                     (a)  to which proceedings have been referred under subsection (1); or

                     (b)  before which a person appears in proceedings for trial of a federal offence on indictment, being proceedings begun after this section commences;

finds the person charged unfit to be tried, the court must determine whether there has been established a prima facie  case that the person committed the offence concerned.

             (4)  Where a magistrate refers proceedings to a court under subsection (1), the magistrate may order the person charged to be detained in prison or in hospital for so long only as is reasonably necessary to allow the court to which the person is referred to determine whether it will make an order under subsection (2) remitting the person to the magistrate, an order under section 20BA dismissing the charge or an order under section 20BB detaining the person in prison or hospital or granting the person bail.

             (5)  Where a court finds a person, other than a person in respect of whom proceedings have been referred to it by a magistrate under subsection (1), to be unfit to be tried, the court may order the person to be detained in prison or hospital for so long only as is reasonably necessary to allow the court to determine whether it will make an order under section 20BA dismissing the charge or an order under section 20BB detaining the person in prison or hospital or granting the person bail.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (3), a prima facie  case is established if there is evidence that would (except for the circumstances by reason of which the person is unfit to be tried) provide sufficient grounds to put the person on trial in relation to the offence.

             (7)  In proceedings to determine whether, for the purposes of subsection (3), a prima facie  case has been established:

                     (a)  the person may give evidence or make an unsworn statement; and

                     (b)  the person may raise any defence that could properly be raised if the proceedings were a trial for that offence; and

                     (c)  the court may seek such other evidence, whether oral or in writing, as it considers likely to assist in determining the matter.

##### <a id="20BA"></a>20BA  Upon determining prima facie  case, court to dismiss charge or to determine fitness within 12 months

             (1)  Where the court determines that there has not been established a prima facie  case that the person committed the offence, the court must, by order, dismiss the charge against the person and, if the person is in custody, order the release of the person from custody.

             (2)  Where the court determines that there has been established a prima facie  case that the person committed the offence, but the court is of the opinion, having regard to:

                     (a)  the character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the person; or

                     (b)  the extent (if any) to which the offence is of a trivial nature; or

                     (c)  the extent (if any) to which the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances;

that it is inappropriate to inflict any punishment, or to inflict any punishment other than a nominal punishment, the court must, by order, dismiss the charge and, if the person is in custody, order the release of the person from custody.

             (3)  Where the court orders that the person be released from custody, the person must be released accordingly.

             (4)  Where the court determines that there has been established a prima facie  case that the person committed the offence, but the court does not dismiss the charge under subsection (2), the court must, as soon as practicable after making that first‑mentioned determination, determine whether, on the balance of probabilities, the person will become fit to be tried, within the period of 12 months after the day the person was found to be unfit to be tried.

             (5)  A court must not make a determination under subsection (4) unless the court has obtained, and considered, written or oral evidence from a duly qualified psychiatrist and one other duly qualified medical practitioner.

             (6)  Nothing in subsection (5) prevents a court from obtaining written or oral evidence from such other persons, bodies or organisations as the court considers appropriate.

##### <a id="20BB"></a>20BB  Persons found by a court to be likely to be fit within 12 months

             (1)  Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person charged with a federal offence who was found unfit to be tried will become fit to be tried within a period of 12 months after that finding, the court must, at the time of making that determination, also determine:

                     (a)  whether the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital; and

                     (b)  if so—whether the person objects to being detained in a hospital.

             (2)  Where a court has made a determination under subsection (1), the court must:

                     (a)  where the court has determined that the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person does not object to being detained in a hospital—order that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital, or continue to be detained in a hospital, as the case requires; or

                     (b)  otherwise:

                              (i)  order that the person be taken to and detained in a place other than a hospital (including a prison); or

                             (ii)  grant the person bail on condition that the person live at an address or in a place specified by the court;

for a period ending:

                     (c)  when the person becomes fit to be tried; or

                     (d)  when, as soon as practicable after the end of the 12 months referred to in subsection (1), the court makes an order under subsection 20BC(2) or (5) as applied under subsection (4);

whichever happens first.

             (3)  Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person charged with a federal offence who was found unfit to be tried will become fit to be tried within 12 months after that finding then, if the person becomes fit within that period:

                     (a)  if the person had been indicted on the charge before being found unfit—the proceedings on the indictment must be continued as soon as practicable; and

                     (b)  if proceedings for the commitment of the person had been referred to the court under section 20B—those proceedings must be continued as soon as practicable as if they had not been so referred.

             (4)  Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person who was found unfit to be tried will become fit to be tried, within 12 months after that finding but the person does not become fit within that period, then, at the end of that period, subsections 20BC(2) and (5) apply as if the court had originally determined, at that time, that the person would not become fit to be tried and had made, under subsection 20BC(1), a further determination of the kind that it made under subsection (1) of this section.

             (5)  Where subsections 20BC(2) and (5) apply in relation to a person in the circumstances set out in subsection (4), then:

                     (a)  in an order under subsection 20BC(2) as so applied the court must, in fixing the period of detention, have regard to any period of detention already served under paragraph (2)(a) or (b) of this section; and

                     (b)  in an order under subsection 20BC(5) as so applied the court must:

                              (i)  in the case of a person already on bail—order, in lieu of the person’s release from custody, the continuance of the person’s release on bail; and

                             (ii)  in fixing the period of the person’s release for which conditions apply, have regard to any period of detention already served under paragraph (2)(a) or (b) of this section.

             (6)  Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person who was found unfit to be tried will become fit to be tried within 12 months after that finding but the person does not become fit within that period, the finding that there is, on the balance of probabilities, a prima facie  case for the commission of the offence charged acts as a stay against any proceedings, or any further proceedings, against the person in respect of the offence.

##### <a id="20BC"></a>20BC  Persons found by a court not to be likely to be fit within 12 months

             (1)  Where a court determines, under section 20BA, that a person who was found unfit to be tried will not become fit to be tried within 12 months after that finding, the court must, at the time of making that determination, also determine:

                     (a)  whether the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital; and

                     (b)  if so—whether the person objects to being detained in a hospital.

             (2)  Where a court has made a determination under subsection (1), the court must:

                     (a)  if the court has determined that the person is suffering from a mental illness, or a mental condition, for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person does not object to being detained in a hospital—order that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital, or continue to be detained in a hospital, as the case requires; or

                     (b)  otherwise—order that the person be detained in a place other than a hospital, including a prison;

for a period specified in the order, not exceeding the maximum period of imprisonment that could have been imposed if the person had been convicted of the offence charged.

             (3)  The Attorney‑General may, at any time, by order in writing, vary the hospital or other place of detention at which a person is detained under this section.

             (4)  Where, for urgent medical or security reasons, it becomes necessary to do so, an officer of the State or Territory in which a person is detained under this section may vary the hospital or other place of detention of that person but, where the officer does so, the officer must forthwith notify the Attorney‑General, in writing, of the variation and of the reasons for the variation.

             (5)  Despite subsection (2), the court may, if in the court’s opinion it is more appropriate to do so than to make an order under subsection (2), order the person’s release from custody either absolutely or subject to conditions to apply for such period as the court specifies in the order, not exceeding 3 years.

             (6)  The conditions may include:

                     (a)  a condition that the person remain in the care of a responsible person nominated in the order; and

                     (b)  a condition that the person attend upon a person nominated, or at a place specified, in the order for assessment of the person’s mental illness, mental condition or intellectual disability and, where appropriate, for treatment; and

                     (c)  any other condition that the court thinks fit.

             (7)  Where a person has been released from custody subject to conditions, the person or the Director of Public Prosecutions may, at any time, apply to the court to vary those conditions.

             (8)  Where a court determines, under subsection 20BA(4), that a person who was found unfit to be tried will not become fit to be tried, within 12 months after the finding, the finding that there is, on the balance of probabilities, a prima facie  case for the commission of the offence charged acts as a stay against any proceedings, or any further proceedings, against the person, in respect of the offence.

##### <a id="20BD"></a>20BD  Review by Attorney‑General

             (1)  Where a court makes an order under subsection 20BC(2), the Attorney‑General must, at least once in each period of 6 months after the day the person is detained under the order, consider whether or not the person should be released from detention.

             (2)  In considering whether the person should be released from detention the Attorney‑General:

                     (a)  must obtain and consider:

                              (i)  a report from a duly qualified psychiatrist or psychologist; and

             (8)  Where, for urgent medical or security reasons it becomes necessary to do so, an officer of the State or Territory in which the person is detained may vary the prison or hospital at which the person is detained but, where the officer does so, the officer must forthwith notify the Attorney‑General, in writing, of the variation and of the reasons for that variation.

##### <a id="20BN"></a>20BN  Attorney‑General to review detention of persons taken back into detention

             (1)  Where, under subsection 20BM(5), a prescribed authority directs that a person be detained in prison or in a hospital, the Attorney‑General must, as soon as practicable after the person is so detained, consider (in this section called the **_initial consideration_**) whether or not the person should be released from detention and must, while the person is in detention, reconsider the matter at least once in each period of 6 months after the initial consideration.

             (2)  Subsection 20BK(2) and, subject to the modification in subsection (3), section 20BL, apply in relation to an initial consideration and a reconsideration under subsection (1).

             (3)  For the purposes of applying section 20BL, subsection 20BL(1) has effect as if the reference in that subsection to subsection 20BK(1) were a reference to subsection (1) of this section.

                   Where a person detained by authority of an order under subsection 20BJ(1) or a warrant under subsection 20BM(5) for a specified period in a State or Territory is due to be released because the period of the person’s detention has ended, the Attorney‑General must notify the mental health authorities of that State or Territory of the proposed release of the person.

### Division 8—Summary disposition of persons suffering from mental illness or intellectual disability

##### <a id="20BQ"></a>20BQ  Person suffering from mental illness or intellectual disability

             (1)  Where, in proceedings in a State or Territory before a court of summary jurisdiction in respect of a federal offence, it appears to the court:

                     (a)  that the person charged is suffering from a mental illness within the meaning of the civil law of the State or Territory or is suffering from an intellectual disability; and

                     (b)  that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings, or such other evidence as the court considers relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the person under this Division than otherwise in accordance with law;

the court may, by order:

                     (c)  dismiss the charge and discharge the person:

                              (i)  into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally, or subject to conditions, for a specified period that does not exceed 3 years; or

                             (ii)  on condition that the person attend on another person, or at a place, specified by the court for an assessment of the first‑mentioned person’s mental condition, or for treatment, or both, but so that the total period for which the person is required to attend on that other person or at that place does not exceed 3 years; or

                            (iii)  unconditionally; or

                     (d)  do one or more of the following:

                              (i)  adjourn the proceedings;

                             (ii)  remand the person on bail;

             (2)  Where a court makes an order under paragraph (1)(c) in respect of a person and a federal offence with which the person has been charged, the order acts as a stay against any proceedings, or any further proceedings, against the person in respect of the offence.

             (3)  Where a court makes an order under subsection (1) in respect of a person and a federal offence with which the person has been charged, the court must not make an order under section 19B, 20, 20AB or 21B in respect of the person in respect of the offence.

##### <a id="20BR"></a>20BR  Means by which court may be informed

                   For the purposes of this Division, a court of summary jurisdiction may inform itself as the court thinks fit, but not so as to require the person charged to incriminate himself or herself.

### Division 9—Sentencing alternatives for persons suffering from mental illness or intellectual disability

##### <a id="20BS"></a>20BS   Hospital orders

             (1)  Where a person is convicted in a State or Territory, on indictment, of a federal offence and the court before which the person is convicted is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the person is suffering from a mental illness within the meaning of the civil law of that State or Territory; and

                     (b)  the illness contributed to the commission of the offence by the person; and

                     (c)  appropriate treatment for the person is available in a hospital in that State or Territory; and

                     (d)  the proposed treatment cannot be provided to the person other than as an inmate of a hospital in the State or Territory;

the court may, without passing sentence on the person, make an order (in this section called a **_hospital order_**) that the person be detained in a hospital specified in the order for a period specified in the order for the purposes of receiving treatment specified in the order.

             (2)  A court must not make a hospital order unless, but for the mental illness of the person, the court would have sentenced the person to a term of imprisonment.

             (3)  A court must not specify a period of detention in a hospital that is longer than the period of imprisonment to which the person would have been sentenced had the hospital order not been made.

             (4)  Where the court orders a person to be detained in a hospital for a specified period, the court may fix a lesser period of detention during which the person is not to be eligible to be released from the hospital.

             (5)  Before reaching an opinion on the matters specified in subsection (1) in relation to a person, the court must obtain and consider the reports of 2 duly qualified psychiatrists with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.

             (6)  A court may make a hospital order in respect of a person even if the person is serving a federal sentence at the time when, under the order, the person is to begin to be detained in hospital and, where a hospital order is made in such circumstances:

                     (a)  the hospital order is sufficient authority for the person to be detained outside the prison during the period of involuntary hospitalisation under the order; and

                     (b)  the person is to be treated, for the purposes of that sentence, as serving that sentence during the period of involuntary hospitalisation under the order; and

                     (c)  if the person is still liable to serve a part of that sentence when the hospital order ends or is discharged, the person is to be returned for that purpose to the prison where he or she was serving that sentence before the making of the order.

             (7)  Subsection (4) does not enable a court, in the case of a person who is serving a federal sentence at the time when the hospital order begins, to fix a lesser period of detention ending:

                     (a)  if a non‑parole period has been fixed in respect of the sentence—before the end of that non‑parole period; and

                     (b)  otherwise—before the end of that sentence.

##### <a id="20BT"></a>20BT  Lesser periods of imprisonment fixed under hospital orders

             (1)  Where a lesser period of detention is fixed under subsection 20BS(4) in relation to a person detained in hospital under a hospital order, the Attorney‑General must, at the end of the lesser period, obtain and consider the reports of 2 duly qualified psychiatrists with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness so as to determine whether or not to release the person from the detention.

             (2)  Unless:

                     (a)  either of the reports of the psychiatrists recommends that the person not be released because of a continuing need for hospital treatment; or

                     (b)  the person continues, at the end of the lesser period of detention, to be required to serve a federal sentence of imprisonment that the person was serving at the time when the hospital order began;

the Attorney‑General must order the person to be released on such conditions (including conditions relating to release into the care of another person specified in the order) for the balance of the period of the hospital order as the Attorney‑General considers appropriate having regard to the reports and to such other matters as he or she considers relevant.

             (3)  Sections 20BM and 20BN apply in relation to a person released from involuntary hospitalisation by order under subsection (2) as if:

                     (a)  the order under that subsection were a release order made under subsection 20BL(1); and

                     (b)  the references in each of those sections to detention in a prison or a hospital were references only to detention in a hospital; and

                     (c)  the reference in subsection 20BM(5) to the period of detention in safe custody under subsection 20BJ(1) were a reference to the period of detention in a hospital specified in the order under subsection 20BS(1).

##### <a id="20BU"></a>20BU  Discharge of hospital orders

             (1)  Where a person is subject to a hospital order, the person or the Director of Public Prosecutions may, at any time while the order is in force, apply to the court that imposed the order to discharge the order and to impose such other sentence as the court thinks appropriate, being a sentence that could have been imposed when the order was made.

             (2)  The court must not discharge a hospital order unless the court is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the person has sufficiently recovered from mental illness no longer to require involuntary hospitalisation; or

                     (b)  that the mental illness will not respond or respond further to hospital treatment.

             (3)  Where the court discharges a hospital order and imposes another sentence instead of the order:

                     (a)  the new sentence must commence on the date of commencement of the order; and

                     (b)  the length of the new sentence must not exceed the length of the order; and

                     (c)  if the sentence is a sentence of imprisonment—the person concerned is to be treated as having served that part of the sentence during which he or she was subject to involuntary hospitalisation.

             (4)  Before reaching an opinion on the matters specified in subsection (2) in relation to a person, the court:

                     (a)  must obtain and consider the reports of 2 duly qualified psychiatrists with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness; and

                     (b)  if the person has been released, under section 20BR, into the care of another person for the balance of the hospital order—must obtain and consider the report of that other person; and

                     (c)  may obtain and consider such other information as it thinks relevant.

             (5)  An application under subsection (1) to the court that made a hospital order may be dealt with by that court whether or not it is constituted in the way in which it was constituted when the order was made.

##### <a id="20BV"></a>20BV  Psychiatric probation orders

             (1)  Where a person is convicted in a State or Territory of a federal offence and the court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the person is suffering from a mental illness within the meaning of the civil law of that State or Territory; and

                     (b)  the illness contributed to the commission of the offence by the person; and

                     (c)  appropriate psychiatric treatment for the person is available in a hospital or other place in the State or Territory; and

                     (d)  the person consents to the order being made;

the court may, without passing sentence on the person, make an order (in this section called a **_psychiatric probation order_**) that the person reside at, or attend at, a specified hospital or other place for the purpose of receiving that psychiatric treatment.

             (2)  The court must not make an order unless the person, or the person’s legal guardian, consents to the proposed treatment.

             (3)  An order is subject to the following additional conditions:

                     (a)  that the person will, during such period, not exceeding 2 years, as the court specifies in the order, be subject to the supervision of a probation officer appointed in accordance with the order and obey all reasonable directions of a probation officer so appointed;

                     (b)  that the person will be of good behaviour for such period, not exceeding 5 years, as the court specifies in the order.

             (4)  The court may, on the application of the person, of the probation officer appointed to supervise the person or of the person in charge of the hospital or other place where the treatment is being undertaken, vary the treatment that the person is to undertake.

##### <a id="20BW"></a>20BW  Breach of psychiatric probation orders

             (1)  Where an order has been made under section 20BV and information is laid before a magistrate, whether before or after the end of the period referred to in paragraph 20BV(3)(a) or (b), alleging that the person has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with a condition of the order, the magistrate may:

                     (a)  issue a summons directing the person to appear, on a date, and at a time and place, fixed in the summons, before the court by which the order was made; or

                     (b)  if the information is laid on oath and the magistrate is of the opinion that proceedings against the person by summons might not be effective—issue a warrant for the arrest of the person.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a person who is served with a summons issued under subsection (1) fails to attend before the court as required by the summons; or

                     (b)  a person who has been admitted to bail under subsection (4) fails to attend before the court as required by the conditions of that bail;

the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the person.

             (3)  A warrant for the arrest of a person issued under subsection (1) or (2) also authorises the bringing of the person before the court as soon as practicable after the person’s arrest and the detention of the person in custody until the person is released by order of the court or under subsection (4).

             (4)  Where a person is arrested under a warrant issued under subsection (1) or (2) and the court before which the person is to be brought is not sitting at the time of the arrest, the person must be brought before a magistrate who may:

                     (a)  remand the person to bail on such recognizance (with or without sureties) as the magistrate thinks fit and on the condition that the person appears before the court on such date, and at such time and place, as the magistrate specifies; or

                     (b)  direct that the person be kept in custody in accordance with the warrant.

##### <a id="20BX"></a>20BX  Enforcement of psychiatric probation orders

                     (a)  without prejudice to the continuance of the order, impose a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 10 penalty units on the person; or

                     (b)  discharge the order and make an order under section 20; or

                     (c)  revoke the order and, subject to subsection (2), deal with the person for the offence in respect of which the order was made, in any way in which the person could have been dealt with for that offence if the order had not been made and the person was before the court for sentence in respect of the offence; or

                     (d)  take no action.

             (2)  Where a person who is subject to an order under section 20BV is dealt with under subsection (1) for the offence in respect of which the order was made, the court must, in so dealing with the person, in addition to any other matters, take into account:

                     (a)  the fact that the order was made; and

                     (b)  anything done under the order; and

                     (c)  any other order made in respect of the offence.

             (3)  Where a person who has been released in accordance with an order under section 20BV is dealt with under subsection (1) for the offence in respect of which the order was made, the person has such rights of appeal in respect of the way in which the person was dealt with for that offence as the person would have if:

                     (a)  the court had, immediately before so dealing with the person, convicted the person of the offence; and

                     (b)  the manner in which the person is dealt with had been a sentence passed upon that conviction.

##### <a id="20BY"></a>20BY  Program probation orders

             (1)  Where a person is convicted in a State or Territory of a federal offence and the court before which the person is convicted is satisfied that:

                     (b)  the disability contributed to the commission of the offence by the person; and

                     (c)  an appropriate education program or treatment is available for the person in that State or Territory;

the court may, without passing sentence on the person, order that the person be released, on condition that the person undertake the program or treatment specified in the order for a period specified in the order.

             (2)  Subsections 20BV(2), (3) and (4) and sections 20BW and 20BX apply to a person in respect of whom an order has been made under subsection (1) of this section in the same way as they apply to a person in respect of whom an order has been made under subsection 20BV(1) and, for that purpose, references in those provisions to treatment have effect as if they were references to an education program or treatment of the kind referred to in subsection (1) of this section.

the Director of Public Prosecutions may, at any time while the offender is under sentence, if the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the opinion that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so, appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence or of the non‑parole period.

             (3)  Where an appeal is begun under this section against the inadequacy of a sentence, or of a non‑parole period, that was reduced because of a person’s undertaking to co‑operate with law enforcement agencies, the court hearing the appeal:

                     (a)  if it is satisfied that the person has failed entirely to co‑operate in accordance with the undertaking—must substitute for the reduced sentence or reduced non‑parole period the sentence, or non‑parole period, that would have been imposed on, or fixed in respect of, the person but for that reduction; and

##### <a id="23A"></a>23A  Application of Part

             (4)  Where a law of a State or Territory would, apart from this subsection, require the electronic recording of confessional evidence in relation to a Commonwealth offence (whether or not expressed as a condition of the admissibility of that evidence), that requirement ceases to apply on the commencement of this Part.

             (5)  The provisions of this Part, so far as they protect the individual, are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any rights and freedoms of the individual under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory.

             (6)  If an offence against a law of the Australian Capital Territory is punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding 12 months and the investigating official concerned is a member or special member of the Australian Federal Police, this Part applies to that offence as if:

                     (b)  the person was brought, while under arrest, to the State or Territory; and

                     (c)  this Part applies in the State or Territory.

             (2)  This Part applies in relation to a person as if he or she first became a protected suspect on arrival in a State or Territory if:

### Division 2—Powers of detention

_Note:       The powers in this Division only apply in relation to people under arrest. They do not apply in relation to protected suspects._

#### Subdivision A—Non‑terrorism offences

##### <a id="23C"></a>23C  Period of investigation if arrested for a non‑terrorism offence

             (1)  If a person is arrested for a Commonwealth offence (other than a terrorism offence), the following provisions apply.

Note:          A person would not be arrested for a Commonwealth offence if, for example, the person has been released under subsection 3W(2)—see the definition of **_arrested_** in subsection 23B(1).

             (2)  The person may, while arrested for the Commonwealth offence, be detained for the purpose of investigating either or both of the following:

                     (a)  whether the person committed the offence;

                     (b)  whether the person committed another Commonwealth offence that an investigating official reasonably suspects that the person has committed.

          (2A)  Subsection (2) ceases to apply at the end of the investigation period, but that cessation does not affect any other power to detain the person.

             (3)  If the person is not released within the investigation period, the person must be brought before a judicial officer within the investigation period or, if it is not practicable to do so within the investigation period, as soon as practicable after the end of the investigation period.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, but subject to subsections (6) and (7), the investigation period begins when the person is arrested, and ends at a time thereafter that is reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances, but does not extend beyond:

                     (a)  if the person is or appears to be under 18, an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander—2 hours; or

                     (b)  in any other case—4 hours;

after the arrest, unless the period is extended under section 23DA.

             (5)  In ascertaining any period of time for the purposes of this section, regard shall be had to the number and complexity of matters being investigated.

             (6)  If the person has been arrested more than once within any period of 48 hours, the investigation period for each arrest other than the first is reduced by so much of any of the following periods as occurred within that 48 hours:

                     (a)  any earlier investigation period or periods under this section;

                     (b)  any earlier investigation period or periods under section 23DB.

          (6A)  However, in relation to each first arrest, disregard subsection (6) for any later arrest if:

                     (a)  the later arrest is for a Commonwealth offence:

                              (i)  that was committed after the end of the person’s period of detention under this Part for the first arrest; or

                             (ii)  that arose in different circumstances to those in which any Commonwealth offence to which the first arrest relates arose, and for which new evidence has been found since the first arrest; and

                     (b)  the person’s questioning associated with the later arrest does not relate to:

                              (i)  a Commonwealth offence to which the first arrest relates; or

                             (ii)  the circumstances in which such an offence was committed.

             (7)  In ascertaining any period of time for the purposes of subsection (4) or (6), disregard any reasonable time during which the questioning of the person is suspended, or delayed, for one or more of the following reasons:

                     (a)  to allow the person to be conveyed from the place at which the person is arrested to the nearest premises at which the investigating official has access to facilities for complying with this Part;

                     (b)  to allow the person, or someone else on the person’s behalf, to communicate with a legal practitioner, friend, relative, parent, guardian, interpreter or other person as provided by this Part;

                     (c)  to allow such a legal practitioner, friend, relative, parent, guardian, interpreter or other person to arrive at the place where the questioning is to take place;

                     (d)  to allow the person to receive medical attention;

                     (e)  because of the person’s intoxication;

                      (f)  to allow for an identification parade to be arranged and conducted;

                     (g)  to allow the making of an application under section 3ZQB or the carrying out of a prescribed procedure within the meaning of Division 4A of Part IAA;

                     (h)  to allow the making and disposing of an application under section 23D, 23WU or 23XB;

                      (i)  to allow a constable to inform the person of matters specified in section 23WJ;

                      (j)  to allow the person to rest or recuperate;

                     (k)  to allow a forensic procedure to be carried out on the person by order of a magistrate under Division 5 of Part ID;

                      (l)  because section 23XGD applies and the time is to be disregarded in working out a period of time for the purposes of that section.

          (7A)  To avoid doubt, subsection (7) does not prevent the person being questioned during a time covered by a paragraph of subsection (7), but if the person is questioned during such a time, the time is not to be disregarded.

Evidentiary provision

             (8)  In any proceedings, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove that:

                     (a)  the person was brought before a judicial officer as soon as practicable; or

                     (b)  any particular time was covered by a provision of subsection (7).

##### <a id="23D"></a>23D  Application may be made for extension of investigation period

                      (f)  the maximum amount of time by which the investigation period could be extended;

                     (g)  the reasons why the investigating official believes the investigation period should be extended;

                     (h)  the period by which the investigating official believes the investigation period should be extended.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not require any information to be included in the application if disclosure of that information is likely:

                     (a)  to prejudice national security (within the meaning of the _National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004_); or

                     (b)  to be protected by public interest immunity; or

                     (c)  to put at risk ongoing operations by law enforcement agencies or intelligence agencies; or

                     (d)  to put at risk the safety of the community, law enforcement officers or intelligence officers.

             (5)  Before the application is considered by the magistrate, the investigating official:

                     (a)  must:

                              (i)  if the application is to be made in writing—provide a copy of the application to the person, or to his or her legal representative; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—inform the person, or his or her legal representative, of all matters or information in the application (other than information of a kind mentioned in subsection (4)); and

                     (b)  must inform the person that he or she, or his or her legal representative, may make representations to the magistrate about the application.

             (6)  If the application contains any information of a kind mentioned in subsection (4), the investigating official may remove it from any copy of the application that is provided to the person or to his or her legal representative.

             (7)  The person, or his or her legal representative, may make representations to the magistrate about the application.

##### <a id="23DB"></a>23DB  Period of investigation if arrested for a terrorism offence

             (1)  If a person is arrested for a terrorism offence, the following provisions apply.

Note:          A person would not be arrested for a terrorism offence if, for example, the person has been released under subsection 3W(2)—see the definition of **_arrested_** in subsection 23B(1).

             (2)  The person may, while arrested for the terrorism offence, be detained for the purpose of investigating either or both of the following:

                     (a)  whether the person committed the offence;

                     (b)  whether the person committed another Commonwealth offence that an investigating official reasonably suspects that the person has committed.

                     (b)  any earlier investigation period or periods under section 23C.

             (8)  However, in relation to each first arrest, disregard subsection (7) for any later arrest if:

                     (a)  the later arrest is for a Commonwealth offence:

                              (i)  that was committed after the end of the person’s period of detention under this Part for the first arrest; or

                             (ii)  that arose in different circumstances to those in which any Commonwealth offence to which the first arrest relates arose, and for which new evidence has been found since the first arrest; and

                     (b)  the person’s questioning associated with the later arrest does not relate to:

                              (i)  a Commonwealth offence to which the first arrest relates; or

                             (ii)  the circumstances in which such an offence was committed.

             (9)  In ascertaining any period of time for the purposes of subsection (5) or (7), disregard any reasonable time during which the questioning of the person is suspended, or delayed, for one or more of the following reasons:

                     (a)  to allow the person to be conveyed from the place at which the person is arrested to the nearest premises at which the investigating official has access to facilities for complying with this Part;

                     (b)  to allow the person, or someone else on the person’s behalf, to communicate with a legal practitioner, friend, relative, parent, guardian, interpreter or other person as provided by this Part;

                     (c)  to allow such a legal practitioner, friend, relative, parent, guardian, interpreter or other person to arrive at the place where the questioning is to take place;

                     (d)  to allow the person to receive medical attention;

                     (e)  because of the person’s intoxication;

                      (f)  to allow for an identification parade to be arranged and conducted;

                     (g)  to allow the making of an application under section 3ZQB or the carrying out of a prescribed procedure within the meaning of Division 4A of Part IAA;

                     (h)  to allow the making and disposing of an application under section 23DC, 23DE, 23WU or 23XB;

                      (i)  to allow a constable to inform the person of matters specified in section 23WJ;

                      (j)  to allow the person to rest or recuperate;

                     (k)  to allow a forensic procedure to be carried out on the person by order of a magistrate under Division 5 of Part ID;

                      (l)  because section 23XGD applies and the time is to be disregarded in working out a period of time for the purposes of that section;

                    (m)  subject to subsection (11), because the time is within a period specified under section 23DD, so long as the suspension or delay in the questioning of the person is reasonable.

           (10)  To avoid doubt:

                     (a)  subsection (9) does not prevent the person being questioned during a time covered by a paragraph of subsection (9), but if the person is questioned during such a time, the time is not to be disregarded; and

                     (b)  a period specified under section 23DD is not extended by any time covered by a paragraph of subsection (9).

Limit on time that may be disregarded under paragraph (9)(m)

           (11)  No more than 7 days may be disregarded under paragraph (9)(m) in relation to an arrest. However:

                     (a)  if the person has been arrested more than once within any period of 48 hours, the 7 day period for each arrest other than the first arrest is reduced by any period or periods specified under section 23DD in relation to any earlier arrest; and

                     (b)  subsection (8) applies as if the reference in that subsection to subsection (7) were a reference to this subsection.

Evidentiary provision

           (12)  In any proceedings, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove that:

                     (a)  the person was brought before a judicial officer as soon as practicable; or

                     (b)  any particular time was covered by a provision of subsection (9).

##### <a id="23DC"></a>23DC  Time during which suspension or delay of questioning may be disregarded—application

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a person is arrested for a terrorism offence; and

                     (b)  an investigation is being conducted into whether the person committed that terrorism offence or another terrorism offence.

Application for specification of period

             (2)  At or before the end of the investigation period, an investigating official (within the meaning of paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition of that expression) may apply, in writing, to a magistrate for a period to be specified for the purpose of paragraph 23DB(9)(m).

             (3)  The application must not be made unless the application is authorised, in writing, by an authorising officer.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), the application must include statements of all of the following:

                     (a)  whether it appears to the investigating official that the person is under 18;

                     (b)  whether it appears to the investigating official that the person is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander;

                     (c)  the outcome of any previous application under this section in relation to:

                              (i)  the person and the arrest; and

                             (ii)  if the person was arrested at any time during the period of 48 hours before the arrest—the person and the earlier arrest or arrests;

                     (d)  the total amount of time that has been disregarded under subsection 23DB(9) in ascertaining the investigation period in relation to:

                              (i)  the person and the arrest; and

                             (ii)  if the person was arrested at any time during the period of 48 hours before the arrest—the person and the earlier arrest or arrests;

                     (e)  the reasons why the investigating official believes the period should be specified, which may, for example, be or include one or more of the following:

                              (i)  the need to collate and analyse information relevant to the investigation from sources other than the questioning of the person (including, for example, information obtained from a place outside Australia);

                             (ii)  the need to allow authorities in or outside Australia (other than authorities in an organisation of which the investigating official is part) time to collect information relevant to the investigation on the request of the investigating official;

                            (iii)  the fact that the investigating official has requested the collection of information relevant to the investigation from a place outside Australia that is in a time zone different from the investigating official’s time zone;

                            (iv)  the fact that translation is necessary to allow the investigating official to seek information from a place outside Australia and/or be provided with such information in a language that the official can readily understand;

                      (f)  the period that the investigating official believes should be specified.

             (5)  Subsection (4) does not require any information to be included in the application if disclosure of that information is likely:

                     (a)  to prejudice national security (within the meaning of the _National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004_); or

                     (b)  to be protected by public interest immunity; or

                     (c)  to put at risk ongoing operations by law enforcement agencies or intelligence agencies; or

                     (d)  to put at risk the safety of the community, law enforcement officers or intelligence officers.

             (6)  Before the application is considered by the magistrate, the investigating official must:

                     (a)  provide a copy of the application to the person or to his or her legal representative; and

                     (b)  inform the person that he or she, or his or her legal representative, may make representations to the magistrate about the application.

             (7)  If the application contains any information of a kind mentioned in subsection (5), the investigating official may remove it from the copy of the application that is provided to the person or to his or her legal representative.

             (8)  The person, or his or her legal representative, may make representations to the magistrate about the application.

                             (ii)  the representations (if any) made by the person, or his or her legal representative, about the application; and

                            (iii)  any other relevant matters; and

                     (b)  the offence is a terrorism offence; and

                     (c)  detention of the person is necessary to preserve or obtain evidence or to complete the investigation into the offence or into another terrorism offence; and

                     (d)  the investigation into the offence is being conducted properly and without delay; and

                     (e)  the application has been authorised by an authorising officer; and

                      (f)  the person, or his or her legal representative, has been given the opportunity to make representations about the application.

Instrument specifying period

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the instrument must:

                     (a)  specify the period as a number (which may be less than one) of hours; and

                     (b)  set out the day and time when it was signed; and

### Division 3—Obligations of investigating officials

_Note:       These obligations apply in relation to protected suspects as well as to people under arrest._

##### <a id="23F"></a>23F  Cautioning persons who are under arrest or protected suspects

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), if a person is under arrest or a protected suspect, an investigating official must, before starting to question the person, caution the person that he or she does not have to say or do anything, but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.

             (2)  The investigating official must inform the person of the caution in accordance with subsection (1), but need only do so in writing if that is the most appropriate means of informing the person.

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply so far as another law of the Commonwealth requires the person to answer questions put by, or do things required by, the investigating official.

##### <a id="23G"></a>23G  Right to communicate with friend, relative and legal practitioner

             (1)  Subject to section 23L, if a person is under arrest or a protected suspect, an investigating official must, before starting to question the person, inform the person that he or she may:

                     (a)  communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a friend or relative to inform that person of his or her whereabouts; and

                     (b)  communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a legal practitioner of the person’s choice and arrange, or attempt to arrange, for a legal practitioner of the person’s choice to be present during the questioning;

and the investigating official must defer the questioning for a reasonable time to allow the person to make, or attempt to make, the communication and, if the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present, to allow the legal practitioner to attend the questioning.

             (2)  Subject to section 23L, if a person is under arrest or a protected suspect and wishes to communicate with a friend, relative or legal practitioner, the investigating official must:

                     (a)  as soon as practicable, give the person reasonable facilities to enable the person to do so; and

                     (b)  in the case of a communication with a legal practitioner—allow the legal practitioner or a clerk of the legal practitioner to communicate with the person in circumstances in which, as far as practicable, the communication will not be overheard.

             (3)  Subject to section 23L, if a person is under arrest or a protected suspect and arranges for a legal practitioner to be present during the questioning, the investigating official must:

                     (a)  allow the person to consult with the legal practitioner in private and provide reasonable facilities for that consultation; and

                     (b)  allow the legal practitioner to be present during the questioning and to give advice to the person, but only while the legal practitioner does not unreasonably interfere with the questioning.

##### <a id="23H"></a>23H  Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders

             (1)  Subject to section 23L, if the investigating official in charge of investigating a Commonwealth offence believes on reasonable grounds that a person who is under arrest, or who is a protected suspect, and whom it is intended to question about the offence is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander, then, unless the official is aware that the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present during the questioning, the official must:

                     (a)  immediately inform the person that a representative of an Aboriginal legal aid organisation will be notified that the person is under arrest or a protected suspect (as the case requires); and

                     (b)  notify such a representative accordingly.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (7) and section 23L, if an investigating official:

                     (a)  interviews a person as a suspect (whether under arrest or not) for a Commonwealth offence, and believes on reasonable grounds that the person is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander; or

                     (b)  believes on reasonable grounds that a person who is under arrest or a protected suspect is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander;

the official must not question the person unless:

                     (c)  an interview friend is present while the person is being questioned and, before the start of the questioning, the official has allowed the person to communicate with the interview friend in circumstances in which, as far as practicable, the communication will not be overheard; or

                     (d)  the person has expressly and voluntarily waived his or her right to have such a person present.

          (2A)  The person suspected, or under arrest, may choose his or her own interview friend unless:

                     (a)  he or she expressly and voluntarily waives this right; or

                     (b)  he or she fails to exercise this right within a reasonable period; or

                     (c)  the interview friend chosen does not arrive within 2 hours of the person’s first opportunity to contact an interview friend.

          (2B)  If an interview friend is not chosen under subsection (2A), the investigating official must choose one of the following to be the person’s interview friend:

                     (a)  a representative of an Aboriginal legal aid organisation;

                     (b)  a person whose name is included in the relevant list maintained under subsection 23J(1).

             (3)  An interview friend may be excluded from the questioning if he or she unreasonably interferes with it.

             (4)  In any proceedings, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove that an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander has waived the right referred to in subsection (2) or (2A), and the burden is not discharged unless the court is satisfied that the person voluntarily waived that right, and did so with full knowledge and understanding of what he or she was doing.

             (5)  In any proceedings, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove that, at the relevant time, a person who is under arrest or a protected suspect had, to the knowledge of the investigating official concerned, made an arrangement of the kind referred to in subsection (1).

             (6)  The rights conferred by this section are in addition to those conferred by section 23G but, to the extent (if any) that compliance with this section results in compliance with section 23G, the requirements of section 23G are satisfied.

             (7)  If the person is under 18, subsection (2) does not apply and section 23K applies.

             (8)  An investigating official is not required to comply with subsection (1), (2) or (2B) in respect of a person if the official believes on reasonable grounds that, having regard to the person’s level of education and understanding, the person is not at a disadvantage in respect of the questioning referred to in that subsection in comparison with members of the Australian community generally.

             (9)  In this section:

                    <a name="interview-friend"></a>**_interview friend_**, in relation to a person to whom subsection (2) applies, means:

                     (a)  a relative or other person chosen by the person; or

                     (b)  a legal practitioner acting for the person; or

                     (c)  a representative of an Aboriginal legal aid organisation; or

                     (d)  a person whose name is included in the relevant list maintained under subsection 23J(1).

##### <a id="23J"></a>23J  Lists of interview friends and interpreters

             (1)  The Minister must, so far as is reasonably practicable, establish and update at such intervals as the Minister thinks appropriate, a list, in relation to a region where there are likely to be persons under arrest and under investigation for Commonwealth offences, of the names of persons (not being constables) who:

                     (a)  are suitable to help Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders under arrest and under investigation for Commonwealth offences; and

                     (b)  are willing to give such help in that region.

             (2)  In establishing and maintaining a list in relation to a region, the Minister or his or her delegate must, from time to time, consult with any Aboriginal legal aid organisation providing legal assistance to Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders in that region.

             (3)  The Minister must, so far as is reasonably practicable, establish and update at such intervals as the Minister thinks appropriate, a list, in relation to such a region, of the names of persons who are able and willing to act as interpreters for Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who:

                     (a)  because of inadequate knowledge of the English language, or a physical disability, are unable to communicate orally with reasonable fluency in that language; and

                     (b)  are under arrest and under investigation in that region for Commonwealth offences.

             (4)  The list of names referred to in subsection (3) must, so far as is reasonably practicable, specify the languages that each person on the list is able to understand and converse in.

             (5)  The Minister may, in writing, delegate to an officer of the Department all or any of the powers of the Minister under this section.

##### <a id="23K"></a>23K  Persons under 18

             (1)  Subject to section 23L, if an investigating official:

                     (a)  interviews a person as a suspect (whether under arrest or not) for a Commonwealth offence, and believes on reasonable grounds that the person is under 18; or

                             (ii)  the concealment, fabrication or destruction of evidence or the intimidation of a witness; or

                     (b)  if the requirement relates to the deferral of questioning—the questioning is so urgent, having regard to the safety of other people, that it should not be delayed by compliance with that requirement.

             (2)  If the requirement relates to things done by or in relation to a legal practitioner, subsection (1) only applies:

                     (a)  in exceptional circumstances; and

                     (b)  if:

                     (b)  preventing or delaying a legal practitioner of the person’s choice from attending at any questioning;

the investigating official must offer the services of another legal practitioner and, if the person accepts, make the necessary arrangements.

             (2)  The investigating official must then provide that information to the other person unless:

                     (a)  the first person does not agree to the provision of that information; or

                     (b)  the investigating official believes on reasonable grounds that the other person is not the first person’s relative, friend or legal representative.

             (3)  This section has effect subject to section 23L.

##### <a id="23N"></a>23N  Right to interpreter

                   Where an investigating official believes on reasonable grounds that a person who is under arrest or a protected suspect is unable, because of inadequate knowledge of the English language or a physical disability, to communicate orally with reasonable fluency in that language, the official must, before starting to question the person, arrange for the presence of an interpreter and defer the questioning or investigation until the interpreter is present.

##### <a id="23P"></a>23P  Right of non‑Australian nationals to communicate with consular office

             (1)  Subject to section 23L, if a person who is under arrest or a protected suspect is not an Australian citizen, an investigating official must, as soon as practicable:

                     (a)  inform the person that if he or she requests that the consular office of:

                              (i)  the country of which he or she is a citizen; or

                             (ii)  the country to which he or she claims a special connection;

                            be notified that he or she is under arrest or a protected suspect (as the case requires), that consular office will be notified accordingly; and

                     (c)  the discretion of a court to exclude unfairly obtained evidence; or

                     (d)  the discretion of a court to exclude illegally or improperly obtained evidence.

##### <a id="23T"></a>23T  Acts authorised under other laws

                   Nothing in this Part prevents an investigating official from asking or causing a person to do a particular thing that the official is authorised to ask or cause the person to do under:

                     (a)  another law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  a provision of a law of the Australian C  apital Territory.

##### <a id="23U"></a>23U  Tape recording of information required to be given to person under arrest

             (1)  If a person is under arrest or a protected suspect, an investigating official who is required by this Part to give the person certain information (including a caution) must tape record, if practicable, the giving of that information and the person’s responses (if any).

             (2)  In any proceedings, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove whether it was practicable to tape record the giving of that information and the person’s responses (if any).

##### <a id="23V"></a>23V  Tape recording of confessions and admissions

             (1)  If a person who is being questioned as a suspect (whether under arrest or not) makes a confession or admission to an investigating official, the confession or admission is inadmissible as evidence against the person in proceedings for any Commonwealth offence unless:

                     (a)  if the confession or admission was made in circumstances where it was reasonably practicable to tape record the confession or admission—the questioning of the person and anything said by the person during that questioning was tape recorded; or

                     (b)  in any other case:

                              (i)  when questioning the person, or as soon as practicable afterwards, a record in writing was made, either in English or in another language used by the person during questioning, of the things said by or to the person during questioning; and

                             (ii)  as soon as practicable after the record was made, it was read to the person in the language used by him or her during questioning and a copy of the record was made available to the person; and

                            (iii)  the person was given the opportunity to interrupt the reading at any time for the purpose of drawing attention to any error or omission that he or she claimed had been made in or from the record and, at the end of the reading, the person was given the opportunity to state whether he or she claimed that there were any errors in or omissions from the record in addition to any to which he or she had drawn attention in the course of the reading; and

                            (iv)  a tape recording was made of the reading referred to in subparagraph (ii) and of everything said by or to the person as a result of compliance with subparagraph (iii), and the requirements of subsection (2) were observed in respect of that recording; and

                             (v)  before the reading referred to in subparagraph (ii), an explanation, in accordance with the form in the Schedule, was given to the person of the procedure that would be followed for the purposes of compliance with that subparagraph and subparagraphs (iii) and (iv).

             (2)  If the questioning, confession or admission, or the confirmation of a confession or admission, of a person is recorded as required under this section, the investigating official must, without charge:

                     (a)  if the recording is an audio recording only or a video recording only—make the recording or a copy of it available to the person or his or her legal representative within 7 days after the making of the recording; and

                     (b)  if both an audio recording and a video recording were made—make the audio recording or a copy of it available to the person or his or her legal representative within 7 days after the making of the recording, and inform the person or his or her legal representative that an opportunity will be provided, on request, for viewing the video recording; and

                     (c)  if a transcript of the tape recording is prepared—make a copy of the transcript available to the person or his or her legal representative within 7 days after the preparation of the transcript.

             (3)  Where a confession or admission is made to an investigating official who was, at the time when it was made, engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior, this section applies as if the acts required by paragraph (1)(b) and subsection (2) to be performed were required to be performed by the official at a time when they could reasonably be performed without prejudice to the covert investigations.

             (4)  Despite any arrangement made under the _Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970_, this section applies to any offence under a law applied by that Act if the investigating official is a member or special member of the Australian Federal Police.

             (5)  A court may admit evidence to which this section applies even if the requirements of this section have not been complied with, or there is insufficient evidence of compliance with those requirements, if, having regard to the nature of and the reasons for the non‑compliance or insufficiency of evidence and any other relevant matters, the court is satisfied that, in the special circumstances of the case, admission of the evidence would not be contrary to the interests of justice.

             (6)  A court may admit evidence to which this section applies even if a provision of subsection (2) has not been complied with if, having regard to the reasons for the non‑compliance and any other relevant matters, the court is satisfied that it was not practicable to comply with that provision.

          (6A)  To avoid doubt, subsection (6) does not limit subsection (5).

             (7)  If a judge permits evidence to be given before a jury under subsection (5) or (6), the judge must inform the jury of the non‑compliance with the requirements of this section, or of the absence of sufficient evidence of compliance with those requirements, and give the jury such warning about the evidence as he or she thinks appropriate in the circumstances.

##### <a id="23W"></a>23W  Proof of belief

and includes a reference to the person being thought of as a transgender person, whether the person is, or was, in fact a transgender person.

             (7)  In this Part (other than subsection (6)), a reference:

### Division 3—Forensic procedures on suspect by consent

##### <a id="23WD"></a>23WD  Forensic procedure may be carried out with informed consent of suspect

             (1)  A person is authorised to carry out a forensic procedure on a suspect with the informed consent of the suspect. The person is authorised to carry out the procedure in accordance with Division 6 and not otherwise.

             (2)  This Division does not authorise the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect who is:

                     (a)  a child; or

                     (b)  an incapable person.

             (3)  This Division does not authorise keeping a suspect in custody, in order to carry out a forensic procedure, after the expiration of the investigation period provided for by Part IC.

Note:          If it is necessary to keep a suspect in custody after the expiration of the Part IC investigation period in order to carry out a forensic procedure, an order of a magistrate under Division 5 will have to be obtained to authorise this.

             (4)  Nothing in this Part or Part IC prevents the carrying out of a forensic procedure, with the informed consent of the suspect, during the investigation period provided for by Part IC. However, neither carrying out the forensic procedure, nor any delay associated with carrying out the forensic procedure, operates to extend the investigation period provided for by Part IC.

Note:          By contrast, the carrying out of a forensic procedure in accordance with a magistrate’s order under Division 5, and associated delays, may delay the expiration of the investigation period provided for by Part IC.

##### <a id="23WE"></a>23WE  People who cannot consent to forensic procedures

             (1)  A child cannot consent to a forensic procedure.

             (2)  An incapable person cannot consent to a forensic procedure.

##### <a id="23WF"></a>23WF  Informed consent to forensic procedures—general

             (1)  This section applies where:

                     (a)  a constable intends to ask a suspect to consent to a forensic procedure; and

                     (b)  the constable does not believe on reasonable grounds that the suspect is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander.

             (2)  A suspect not covered by section 23WE gives informed consent to a forensic procedure if the suspect consents after a constable:

                     (a)  asks the suspect to consent to the forensic procedure under section 23WH; and

                     (b)  gives the suspect a written statement setting out:

                              (i)  the information that the suspect must be given under paragraphs 23WJ(1)(a), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j); and

                             (ii)  the nature of the information that the suspect must be given under paragraphs 23WJ(1)(b), (c) and (d) (but not the specific information that the suspect is to be given under these paragraphs in relation to the particular forensic procedure); and

                     (c)  informs the suspect about the forensic procedure in accordance with section 23WJ; and

                     (d)  gives the suspect a reasonable opportunity to communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a legal practitioner of the suspect’s choice and, subject to subsection (3), to do so in private.

             (3)  If the suspect is in custody, the constable need not allow the suspect to communicate, or attempt to communicate, with the legal practitioner in private if the constable suspects on reasonable grounds that the suspect might attempt to destroy or contaminate any evidence that might be obtained by carrying out the forensic procedure.

##### <a id="23WG"></a>23WG  Informed consent to forensic procedures—Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders

             (1)  This section applies where:

                     (a)  a constable intends to ask a suspect to consent to a forensic procedure; and

                     (b)  the constable believes on reasonable grounds that the suspect is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander.

             (2)  A suspect not covered by section 23WE gives informed consent to a forensic procedure if the suspect consents after a constable:

                     (a)  asks the suspect to consent to the forensic procedure under section 23WH; and

                     (b)  informs the suspect about the forensic procedure in accordance with section 23WJ; and

                     (c)  complies with the rest of this section.

             (3)  The constable must not ask the suspect to consent to the forensic procedure unless:

                     (a)  an interview friend is present; or

                     (b)  the suspect has expressly and voluntarily waived his or her right to have an interview friend present; or

                     (c)  the constable is a senior constable and he or she believes on reasonable grounds that, having regard to the suspect’s level of education and understanding, the suspect is not at a disadvantage in relation to the request to consent by comparison with members of the Australian community generally.

Note:          Section 23YK relates to proving a waiver under paragraph (3)(b) of this section.

             (4)  Before asking the suspect to consent to a forensic procedure, the constable must:

                     (a)  inform the suspect that a representative of an Aboriginal legal aid organisation will be notified that the suspect is to be asked to consent to a forensic procedure; and

                     (b)  notify such a representative accordingly.

             (5)  The constable is not required to comply with subsection (4) if:

                     (a)  he or she is aware that the suspect has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present while the suspect is asked to consent to the forensic procedure; or

                     (b)  paragraph (3)(b) or (c) applies.

             (6)  After asking a suspect covered by paragraph (3)(b) or (c) to consent to a forensic procedure, the constable must give the suspect a reasonable opportunity to communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a legal practitioner of the suspect’s choice and, subject to subsection (8), to do so in private.

             (7)  After asking a suspect not covered by paragraph (3)(b) or (c) to consent to a forensic procedure, the constable must allow the suspect to communicate with the interview friend (if any), and with the suspect’s legal representative (if any), and, subject to subsection (8), to do so in private.

             (8)  If a suspect covered by subsection (6) or (7) is in custody, the constable need not allow the suspect to communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a legal practitioner, or the suspect’s interview friend or legal representative, in private if the constable suspects on reasonable grounds that the suspect might attempt to destroy or contaminate any evidence that might be obtained by carrying out the forensic procedure.

             (9)  An interview friend (other than a legal representative) of the suspect may be excluded from the presence of the constable and the suspect if the interview friend unreasonably interferes with or obstructs the constable in asking the suspect to consent to the forensic procedure, or in informing the suspect as required by section 23WJ.

##### <a id="23WH"></a>23WH  Constable may request suspect to consent to forensic procedure

                   A constable may ask a suspect to undergo a forensic procedure if the constable is satisfied as required by section 23WI.

##### <a id="23WI"></a>23WI  Matters to be considered by constable before requesting consent to forensic procedure

             (1)  The constable must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that:

                     (a)  the person on whom the procedure is proposed to be carried out is a suspect; and

                     (b)  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure is likely to produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed a relevant offence; and

                     (c)  the request for consent to the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances; and

                     (d)  the person on whom the forensic procedure is proposed to be carried out is not a child or an incapable person.

             (2)  In determining whether a request is justified in all the circumstances, the constable must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed the offence concerned against the public interest in upholding the physical integrity of the suspect.

             (3)  In balancing those interests, the constable must have regard to the following matters:

                     (a)  the seriousness of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the relevant offence and the gravity of the relevant offence;

                     (b)  the degree of the suspect’s alleged participation in the commission of the relevant offence;

                     (c)  the age, physical health and mental health of the suspect, to the extent that they are known to the constable or can reasonably be discovered by the constable (by asking the suspect or otherwise);

                     (e)  whether there is a less intrusive but reasonably practicable way of obtaining evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed the relevant offence;

                      (f)  any other matter considered relevant to balancing those interests.

             (4)  Without limiting the matters that the constable may take into account in considering, for the purposes of paragraph (3)(e), the intrusiveness of the forensic procedure, the constable must (where appropriate) take into account the religious beliefs of the suspect.

##### <a id="23WJ"></a>23WJ  Matters that suspect must be informed of before giving consent

             (1)  The constable must inform the suspect of the following matters:

                     (a)  that the giving of information under this section, and the giving of consent (if any) by the suspect, is being or will be recorded by audio tape, videotape or other electronic means, or in writing, and that the suspect has a right to a copy of that record in a form provided by section 23YF;

                     (b)  the purpose for which the forensic procedure is required;

                     (c)  the offence in relation to which the constable wants the forensic procedure carried out;

                     (d)  the way in which the forensic procedure is to be carried out;

                     (e)  that the forensic procedure may produce evidence against the suspect that might be used in a court of law;

                      (f)  that the forensic procedure will be carried out by an appropriately qualified person;

                     (g)  if relevant, the matters specified in subsection (2);

                     (h)  if the constable believes on reasonable grounds that the suspect is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander—that the suspect’s interview friend may be present while the forensic procedure is carried out;

                      (i)  that the suspect may refuse to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure;

                    (ia)  the effect of section 23XZ;

                      (j)  the consequences of not consenting, as specified in subsection (3), (4) or (5) (whichever is applicable);

                     (k)  that information obtained from analysis of forensic material obtained may be placed on the Commonwealth DNA database system and the rules that will apply to its disclosure and use under this Part.

Suspect’s right to have medical practitioner or dentist present during intimate forensic procedures

             (2)  The constable must inform the suspect that the suspect may ask that a medical practitioner or dentist (depending on the kind of forensic procedure) of his or her choice be present while the forensic procedure is carried out (unless the forensic procedure is a non‑intimate forensic procedure).

Failure to consent to non‑intimate forensic procedure—suspect in custody

             (3)  If the suspect is in custody and the forensic procedure is a non‑intimate forensic procedure, the constable must inform the suspect that, if the suspect does not consent:

                     (a)  a constable may order the carrying out of the forensic procedure under Division 4 if he or she is satisfied of the matters referred to in subsection 23WO(1); or

                     (b)  an application may be made to a magistrate for an order authorising the carrying out of the forensic procedure.

Failure to consent to intimate forensic procedure—suspect in custody

             (4)  If the suspect is in custody and the forensic procedure is an intimate forensic procedure, the constable must inform the suspect that, if the suspect does not consent, an application may be made to a magistrate for an order authorising the carrying out of the forensic procedure.

Failure to consent to forensic procedure—suspect not in custody

##### <a id="23WK"></a>23WK  Withdrawal of consent

                   If a person expressly withdraws consent to the carrying out of a forensic procedure under this Part (or if the withdrawal of such consent can reasonably be inferred from the person’s conduct) before or during the carrying out of the forensic procedure, then:

                     (a)  the forensic procedure is to be treated from the time of the withdrawal as a forensic procedure for which consent has been refused; and

             (2)  If tape recording the giving of the information and the suspect’s responses (if any) is not practicable, the constable must ensure that a written record of the giving of the information and the suspect’s responses (if any) is made, and that a copy of the record is made available to the suspect.

Note:          Division 9 contains provisions about making copies of material (including copies of tapes) available to the suspect.

                     (c)  any time during which carrying out the procedure is suspended or delayed to allow such a legal practitioner, friend, relative, parent, guardian, interpreter, medical practitioner, dentist or other person to arrive at the place where the procedure is to be carried out;
