          (4A)  A documentary cargo report must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (b)  be in an approved form; and

             (6)  The CEO may approve different forms or statements for the cargo reports to be made in different circumstances or by different kinds of cargo reporters.

             (7)  The form or statement approved for a report by a special reporter in relation to low value cargo of a particular kind must not require the special reporter to include information relating to cargo of that kind at a level of specificity below the level of a submaster air waybill or an ocean bill of lading, as the case requires.

          (7A)  The form or statement approved for a report by a re‑mail reporter in relation to re‑mail items must not require the reporter to include information relating to re‑mail items at a level of specificity below the level of a submaster air waybill or an ocean bill of lading, as the case requires.

Note:          This means that a re‑mail reporter using the approved form or statement does not have to give information about individual re‑mail items.

          (7B)  However, a re‑mail reporter must not use that approved form or statement for a re‑mail item for which the reporter has information below that level of specificity.

Note:          A re‑mail reporter who does not use the approved form or statement for re‑mail items must provide information about individual re‑mail items in a cargo report.

             (8)  A cargo report is to be made not later than:

                     (a)  if the cargo is carried on a ship:

                              (i)  the start of the prescribed period; or

                             (ii)  if the journey from the last port is of a kind described in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph—the start of the shorter period that is specified in those regulations;

                            before the estimated time of arrival of the ship at the first port in Australia since it last departed from a port outside Australia; or

                     (b)  if the cargo is carried on an aircraft:

                              (i)  2 hours or such other period as is prescribed by the regulations; or

                             (ii)  if the flight from the last airport is of a kind described in regulations made for the purposes of this subparagraph—such shorter period as is specified in those regulations;

                            before the estimated time of arrival specified in the report under section 64 of the impending arrival of the aircraft at the first airport in Australia since it last departed from an airport outside Australia.

          (8A)  Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (8)(a) may prescribe matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) arising out of the making of regulations for those purposes.

           (10)  A cargo reporter who contravenes this section commits an offence punishable, on conviction, by a penalty not exceeding 60 penalty units.

           (11)  An offence against subsection (10) is an offence of strict liability.

           (12)  If:

                     (a)  a cargo reporter who is required to make a cargo report in respect of particular goods commits an offence against this section because the report is not made before the time by which it was required by subsection (8) to be made; and

                     (b)  that time occurs before the end of the general moratorium period or, if a further moratorium period is granted to the cargo reporter, before the end of the further moratorium period;

the cargo reporter is not liable to be prosecuted for the offence and an infringement notice cannot be served on the cargo reporter under Subdivision A of Division 5 of Part XIII for the offence.

           (13)  The **_general moratorium period_** is the period of 6 months beginning on the date of commencement of this section.

           (14)  If:

                     (a)  a cargo reporter applies to the CEO for the grant to the cargo reporter of a further moratorium period to have effect at the end of the general moratorium period; and

                     (b)  the CEO is satisfied that the cargo reporter has, within the general moratorium period, made reasonable progress in:

                              (i)  installing the facilities required for the making of electronic cargo reports; or

                             (ii)  in putting in place business practices or entering into business arrangements to enable the making of electronic cargo reports;

the CEO may grant to the cargo reporter a **_further moratorium period_** of not more than 18 months beginning at the end of the general moratorium period.

        (14A)  A cargo reporter who is required to make a cargo report in respect of particular goods is not liable to be prosecuted for, and cannot be served with an infringement notice under Division 5 of Part XIII for, an offence against this section if:

                     (a)  the cargo reporter made a cargo report, but contravened subsection (8) because the report was not made before the start of a certain period; and

                     (b)  the time (the **_actual time of arrival_**) at which the ship or aircraft in question arrived at the first port or airport in Australia since it last departed from a port or airport outside Australia was later than the estimated time of arrival referred to in subsection (8); and

                     (c)  the cargo reporter would not have contravened subsection (8) if the estimated time of arrival of the ship or aircraft had been its actual time of arrival.

##### <a id="64ACC"></a>64ACC  Information does not have to be reported if it has already been reported to the Migration Department

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  both:

                              (i)  section 64ACA or 64ACB  of this Act; and

                             (ii)  section 245L of the _Migration Act 1958_;

                            require the same piece of information in relation to a particular passenger or member of the crew on a particular voyage or flight to be reported; and

                     (b)  the operator has reported that piece of information in relation to that passenger or member of the crew in accordance with that section of the _Migration Act 1958_;

the operator is then taken not to be required by section 64ACA or 64ACB of this Act (as the case requires) to report the same piece of information in relation to those passengers or crew.

Note:          This may mean that no report at all is required under this Act.

                     (a)  any conviction of the person of an offence against this Act committed within the 10 years immediately before the decision; and

             (4)  The CEO must, in deciding whether a company is a fit and proper company for the purpose of subparagraph (1)(e)(v), have regard to:

                     (a)  any conviction of the company of an offence:

                              (i)   against this Act; or

                             (ii)  if it is punishable by a fine of $5,000 or more—against another law of the Commonwealth, or a law of a State or of a Territory;

             (7)  If, for any reason, the CEO has not completed the consideration of the application for renewal of registration at the time when the current period of registration would, but for this subsection, expire, the current period of registration is taken to continue until the consideration of the application is concluded and a resulting decision made.

             (8)  If the CEO decides to renew the registration of a special reporter in relation to low value cargo of a particular kind, the CEO must renew the registration and notify the applicant for renewal, in writing, of that decision specifying the day on which, in accordance with subsection (10), the renewal of registration comes into force.

                     (a)  the CEO may, by notice in writing to the applicant, require the applicant to provide such additional information relating to the matter as the CEO specifies within a period specified in the notice; and

                     (b)  unless the information is given to the CEO within that period—the applicant is taken to have withdrawn the application.

##### <a id="67EL"></a>67EL  CEO to allocate a special identifying code for each special reporter

             (5)  If the CEO decides to cancel the registration within the 14 days, the registration is cancelled:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—28 days after the CEO’s decision; or

                     (b)  if the special reporter applies to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the CEO’s decision—when the Tribunal affirms the CEO’s decision.

             (6)  The CEO must, by notice in writing, cancel a registration if the CEO receives a written request by the special reporter that the registration be cancelled on or after a specified day indicated in the request letter.

             (7)  A notice under subsection (1), (4) or (6) may be served:

                     (a)  by post at the address indicated by the special reporter in the application for registration or renewal or at an address subsequently indicated by the special reporter; or

                     (c)  by giving it personally to the special reporter, if the special reporter is a natural person.

                     (b)  by leaving it at a place that has been allocated for lodgment of import declarations in a Customs Office;

at the place at which the goods are to be delivered for home consumption.

             (5)  If the information communicated to Customs in an import declaration relating to goods adequately identifies any permission (however it is described) that has been given for the importation of those goods, the identification of the permission in that information is taken, for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth (including this Act), to be the production of the permission to an officer.

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not affect any power of an officer, under this Act, to require the production of a permission referred to in that subsection.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  an import declaration is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  before the time when the declaration is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the declaration relates have been imported or have been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to have been entered for home consumption.

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  an import declaration is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

the goods are taken to be entered for home consumption only when they are brought to that port or airport.

##### <a id="71B"></a>71B  Liability for import declaration processing charge

             (1)  When an import declaration (including an altered import declaration) in respect of goods to which section 68 applies (other than warehoused goods) is, or is taken to have been, communicated to Customs under section 71A, the owner of the goods becomes liable to pay import declaration processing charge in respect of the declaration.

             (2)  If a person who is an owner of goods pays import declaration processing charge in respect of an import declaration relating to particular goods, any other person who is an owner of those goods ceases to be liable to pay charge in respect of that declaration.

             (3)  If an import declaration is withdrawn under subsection 71F(1), or is taken, under subsection 71F(2) or (7), to have been withdrawn, before the issue of an authority to deal in respect of goods covered by the declaration, then, despite subsection (1), the owner of the goods is not liable to pay import declaration processing charge in respect of the declaration.

##### <a id="71BA"></a>71BA  Warehoused goods declaration fee

             (1)  An owner of warehoused goods who makes an import declaration in respect of the goods is liable to pay a fee (the **_warehoused goods declaration fee_**) for the processing by Customs of the declaration.

             (2)  The amount of the warehoused goods declaration fee is:

                     (a)  if the import declaration is made electronically—$23.20 or, if another amount (not exceeding $34.80) is prescribed by the regulations, the amount so prescribed; or

             (3)  If a person who is an owner of warehoused goods pays the warehoused goods declaration fee for the processing of an import declaration in respect of the goods, any other person who is an owner of the goods ceases to be liable to pay the fee for the processing of the import declaration.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="wareh-good"></a>**_warehoused goods_** includes goods that, under section 100, may be dealt with as warehoused goods.

             (6)  Customs must give an authority under subsection (4) in relation to goods covered by item 2 of the table in subsection 132AA(1) if subsection (4) would require Customs to do so apart from paragraph (4)(b).

Note:          Subsection 132AA(1) provides that import duty on goods covered by item 2 of the table in that subsection must be paid by a time worked out under the regulations.

             (7)  Customs must give an authority under subsection (4) in relation to goods if:

                     (a)  that subsection would require Customs to do so apart from the fact that any or all of the following were not paid when duty on the goods was paid (or would have been payable if the goods had been subject to duty):

                              (i)  the assessed GST payable on the taxable importation, if any, that is associated with the import of the goods;

                             (ii)  if a taxable importation of a luxury car is associated with the import of the goods—the assessed luxury car tax payable on that taxable importation;

                            (iii)  if a taxable dealing is associated with the import of the goods—the assessed wine tax payable on that dealing; and

                     (b)  because of the following provisions, the unpaid GST, luxury car tax or wine tax (as appropriate) was not payable until after duty on the goods was payable (or would have been payable if the goods had been subject to duty):

                              (i)  paragraph 33‑15(1)(b) of the GST Act;

                             (ii)  paragraph 13‑20(1)(b) of the Luxury Car Tax Act;

             (9)  An authority to deal with goods may be expressed to be subject to a condition that a specified permission for the goods to be dealt with (however it is described) be obtained under another law of the Commonwealth.

           (10)  If an authority to deal with goods is expressed to be subject to the condition that a specified permission be obtained, the authority is taken not to have been given until the permission has been obtained.

           (11)  An officer may, at any time before goods authorised to be taken into home consumption are so dealt with, cancel the authority:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person who made the declaration or, if that person does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person who made the declaration, a message stating that the authority is cancelled and setting out the reasons for the cancellation.

           (12)  If, at any time before goods authorised to be taken into home consumption are so dealt with, an officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of any Customs‑related law, the officer may suspend the authority for a specified period:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension; and

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person who made the declaration or, if that person does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person who made the declaration, a message stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension.

           (13)  If, during the suspension under subsection (12) of an authority, an officer becomes satisfied that there are no longer reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of a Customs‑related law, the officer must revoke the suspension:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the suspension is revoked; and

             (4)  A person who has received a permission may examine the goods in accordance with the permission in the presence of an officer.

##### <a id="71DA"></a>71DA  An officer may seek additional information

             (1)  Without limiting the information that may be required to be included in an import declaration, if an import declaration has been made in respect of goods, authority to deal with the goods may be refused until an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations:

                     (b)  is satisfied of any other matter that may be relevant to the granting of an authority to deal.

             (2)  If an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations believes, on reasonable grounds, that the owner of goods to which an import declaration relates has custody or control of commercial documents, or has, or can obtain, information, relating to the goods that will assist the officer to determine whether this Act has been or is being complied with in respect of the goods, the officer may require the owner:

                     (a)  to deliver to the officer the commercial documents in respect of the goods that are in the owner’s custody or control (including any such documents that had previously been delivered to an officer and had been returned to the owner); or

                     (b)  if another person made the declaration on behalf of the owner—that other person;

any questions relating to the goods.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  the owner of goods has been required to deliver documents or information in relation to the goods under subsection (2); or

                     (b)  the owner of, or the person making an import declaration in respect of, goods has been asked a question in respect of the goods under subsection (5); or

                     (c)  the owner of goods has been required to verify a matter in respect of the goods under subsection (6);

authority to deal with the relevant goods in accordance with the declaration must not be granted unless:

                     (e)  the question referred to in paragraph (b) has been answered or withdrawn; or

                      (f)  the requirement referred to in paragraph (c) has been complied with or withdrawn, or a security has been taken for compliance with the requirement;

as the case requires.

             (8)  Subject to section 215, if a person delivers a commercial document to an officer doing duty in relation to import declarations under this section, the officer must deal with the document and then return it to the person.

#### Subdivision C—Requests for cargo release

##### <a id="71DB"></a>71DB  Making a request for cargo release

             (1)  A request for cargo release (an **_RCR_**) in respect of goods is a communication to Customs in accordance with this section of a request for the release of goods to which section 68 applies that are intended to be entered for home consumption.

             (2)  An RCR must be communicated electronically.

             (3)  An RCR can be made only:

                     (a)  by a person (an **_accredited client_**) who has entered into an import information contract or by a customs broker nominated in the contract to make communications to Customs on behalf of the person; and

                     (b)  while the contract is in force.

             (4)  An RCR must contain the information contained in an approved statement.

             (5)  If the information communicated to Customs in an RCR in respect of goods adequately identifies any permission (however it is described) that has been given for the importation of those goods, the identification of the permission in that information is taken, for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth (including this Act), to be the production of the permission to an officer.

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not affect any power of an officer, under this Act, to require the production of a permission referred to in that subsection.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  an RCR in respect of goods is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  before the time when the RCR is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the RCR relates have been imported or have been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to have been entered for home consumption.

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  an RCR in respect of goods is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  at the time when the RCR is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods have not been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to be entered for home consumption only when they are brought to that port or airport.

##### <a id="71DC"></a>71DC  Liability for an RCR processing charge

             (2)  RCR processing charge in respect of an RCR in respect of goods is payable on the accredited client payment day for the month following the month during which the goods are taken, under section 71DB, to have been entered for home consumption.

             (3)  If an RCR is withdrawn under subsection 71F(1), or is taken to be withdrawn under subsection 71F(2) or (7), before the issue of an authority to deal in respect of goods covered by the RCR, then, despite subsection (1), the person is not liable to pay an RCR processing charge in respect of the RCR.

##### <a id="71DD"></a>71DD  Making of import information contracts

                     (a)  enabling RCRs to be made by, or on behalf of, the person; and

                     (b)  enabling payments of amounts of import duty, accredited client monthly duty estimate, RCR processing charge and periodic declaration processing charge to be made on accredited client payment days.

Note:          The CEO may make business rules that a person who wishes to enter into, or is a party to, an import information contract must comply with (see section 273EB).

             (2)  The CEO must not enter into an import information contract with a person (other than a company specified in subsection (3)) unless the CEO is satisfied, as a result of an audit carried out by a person chosen in accordance with the business rules, that the person can provide Customs with accurate information that is necessary to enable Customs to perform duties in relation to goods imported into Australia.

             (3)  The following companies are specified for the purposes of subsection (2):

          (4A)  Provisions in an import information contract relating to how amounts of accredited client monthly duty estimate payable by a person are to be determined must provide a method of working out the amounts that results in the estimate payable by the person for a particular month being approximately equal to the total amount of import duty that the person will be liable to pay in respect of goods that are:

                     (a)  covered by the import information contract; and

                     (b)  taken, under section 71DB, to have been entered for home consumption during the month.

           (10)  If, during the suspension under subsection (9) of an authority, an officer becomes satisfied that there are no longer reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of a Customs‑related law, the officer must revoke the suspension by sending electronically, to the person to whom the message notifying the suspension was sent, a message stating that the suspension is revoked.

           (11)  A cancellation or suspension of an authority, or a revocation of a suspension of an authority, has effect from the time when the relevant notice is served or the relevant message is sent, as the case may be.

#### Subdivision D—Warehouse declarations

##### <a id="71DH"></a>71DH  Making a warehouse declaration

             (1)  A warehouse declaration is a communication to Customs in accordance with this section of information about goods to which section 68 applies that are intended to be entered for warehousing.

             (2)  A warehouse declaration may be communicated by document or electronically.

             (3)  A documentary warehouse declaration must be communicated to Customs:

                     (a)  by giving or sending it to an officer doing duty in relation to warehouse declarations; or

                     (b)  by leaving it at a place that has been allocated for lodgment of warehouse declarations in a Customs Office;

at the place at which the goods are to be delivered for warehousing.

             (5)  If the information communicated to Customs in a warehouse declaration relating to goods adequately identifies any permission (however it is described) that has been given for the importation of those goods, the identification of the permission in that information is taken, for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth (including this Act), to be the production of the permission to an officer.

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not affect any power of an officer, under this Act, to require the production of a permission referred to in that subsection.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  a warehouse declaration is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  before the time when the declaration is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the declaration relates have been imported or have been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to have been entered for warehousing.

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  a warehouse declaration is, or is taken under section 71L to have been, communicated to Customs; and

                     (b)  at the time when the warehouse declaration is, or is so taken to have been, communicated to Customs, the goods to which the declaration relates have not been brought to the first port or airport in Australia at which any goods are to be discharged;

the goods are taken to be entered for warehousing only when they are brought to that port or airport.

##### <a id="71DI"></a>71DI  Liability for warehouse declaration processing charge

             (1)  When a warehouse declaration (including an altered warehouse declaration) in respect of goods is, or is taken to have been, communicated to Customs under section 71DH, the owner of the goods becomes liable to pay warehouse declaration processing charge in respect of the declaration.

             (2)  If a person who is an owner of goods pays warehouse declaration processing charge in respect of a warehouse declaration relating to particular goods, any other person who is an owner of those goods ceases to be liable to pay charge in respect of that declaration.

             (3)  If a warehouse declaration is withdrawn under subsection 71F(1), or is taken, under subsection 71F(2) or (7), to have been withdrawn, before the issue of an authority to deal in respect of goods covered by the declaration, then, despite subsection (1), the owner of the goods is not liable to pay warehouse declaration processing charge in respect of the declaration.

##### <a id="71DJ"></a>71DJ  Authority to deal with goods in respect of which a warehouse declaration has been made

             (1)  If a warehouse declaration in respect of goods has been communicated to Customs, Customs must give a warehouse declaration advice, by document or electronically, in accordance with this section.

                             (ii)  a statement that the goods are directed to be held in their current location or are directed for further examination.

             (3)  A warehouse declaration advice relating to goods entered by an electronic warehouse declaration:

                     (a)  must refer to the number given by Customs to identify the particular warehouse declaration; and

                     (b)  must be communicated electronically to the person who made the declaration; and

                     (c)  must contain:

                              (i)  a statement to the effect that the goods are cleared for warehousing; or

             (6)  If goods are authorised to be taken into warehousing, the authority to deal, whether given by a document or electronically, must set out:

                     (a)  any condition of the kind referred to in subsection (7) to which the authority is subject; and

                     (b)  the date on which the authority is given; and

                     (c)  such other information as is prescribed.

             (7)  An authority to deal with goods may be expressed to be subject to a condition that a specified permission for the goods to be dealt with (however it is described) be obtained under another law of the Commonwealth.

             (8)  If an authority to deal with goods is expressed to be subject to the condition that a specified permission be obtained, the authority is taken not to have been given until the permission has been obtained.

             (9)  An officer may, at any time before goods authorised to be taken into warehousing are so dealt with, cancel the authority:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the authority is cancelled and setting out the reasons for the cancellation; and

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person who made the declaration or, if that person does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person who made the declaration, a message stating that the authority is cancelled and setting out the reasons for the cancellation.

           (10)  If, at any time before goods authorised to be taken into warehousing are so dealt with, an officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of any Customs‑related law, the officer may suspend the authority for a specified period:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension; and

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person who made the declaration or, if that person does not have possession of the goods, on the person who has possession of the goods; or

                     (b)  if the authority was given in respect of an electronic declaration—by sending electronically, to the person who made the declaration, a message stating that the authority is so suspended and setting out the reasons for the suspension.

           (11)  If, during the suspension under subsection (10) of an authority, an officer becomes satisfied that there are no longer reasonable grounds to suspect that the goods were imported into Australia in contravention of a Customs‑related law, the officer must revoke the suspension:

                     (a)  if the authority was given in respect of a documentary declaration, by:

                              (i)  signing a notice stating that the suspension is revoked; and

                             (ii)  serving a copy of the notice on the person to whom the notice of the suspension was given; or

             (4)  A person who has received a permission may examine the goods in accordance with the permission in the presence of an officer.

##### <a id="71DL"></a>71DL  An officer may seek additional information

             (1)  Without limiting the information that may be required to be included in a warehouse declaration, if a warehouse declaration has been made in respect of goods, authority to deal with the goods may be refused until an officer doing duty in relation to warehouse declarations:

                     (b)  is satisfied of any other matter that may be relevant to the granting of an authority to deal.

             (2)  If an officer doing duty in relation to warehouse declarations believes, on reasonable grounds, that the owner of goods to which a warehouse declaration relates has custody or control of commercial documents, or has, or can obtain, information, relating to the goods that will assist the officer to determine whether this Act has been or is being complied with in respect of the goods, the officer may require the owner:

                     (a)  to deliver to the officer the commercial documents in respect of the goods that are in the owner’s custody or control (including any such documents that had previously been delivered to an officer and had been returned to the owner); or

                     (b)  to deliver to the officer such information, in writing, relating to the goods (being information of a kind specified in the notice) as is within the knowledge of the owner or as the owner is reasonably able to obtain.

                     (b)  if another person made the declaration on behalf of the owner—that other person;

any questions relating to the goods.

             (6)  If an officer doing duty in relation to warehouse declarations believes, on reasonable grounds, that the owner of goods to which a warehouse declaration relates has custody or control of commercial documents, or has, or can obtain, information, relating to the goods that will assist the officer to verify the particulars shown in the warehouse declaration, the officer may require the owner to produce the documents or supply the information to the officer.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  the owner of goods has been required to deliver documents or information in relation to the goods under subsection (2); or

                     (b)  the owner of, or the person making a warehouse declaration in respect of, goods has been asked a question in respect of the goods under subsection (5); or

#### Subdivision B—Export declarations

##### <a id="114"></a>114  Making an export declaration

             (1)  An export declaration is a communication to Customs in accordance with this section of information about goods that are intended for export.

             (2)  An export declaration can be communicated by document or electronically.

             (3)  A documentary export declaration:

                     (a)  can be made only by the owner of the goods concerned; and

                     (b)  must be communicated to Customs by giving or sending it to an officer doing duty in relation to export declarations; and

                     (c)  must be in an approved form; and

                     (d)  must contain such information as is required by the form; and

                     (e)  must be signed by the person making it.

             (4)  An electronic export declaration must communicate such information as is set out in an approved statement.

             (5)  If the information communicated to Customs in an export declaration relating to goods adequately identifies any permission (however it is described) that has been given for the exportation of those goods, the identification of the permission in that information is taken, for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth (including this Act), to be the production of the permission to an officer.

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not affect any power of an officer, under this Act, to require the production of a permission referred to in that subsection.

             (7)  When, in accordance with section 119D, an export declaration is taken to have been communicated to Customs, the goods to which the declaration relates are taken to have been entered for export.

             (8)  Customs may refuse to accept or deal with an export declaration in circumstances prescribed by the regulations.

             (9)  Customs must communicate a refusal to accept or deal with an export declaration by notice given by document or electronically to the person who made the declaration.

##### <a id="114A"></a>114A  An officer may seek additional information

             (1)  Without limiting the information that may be required to be included in an export declaration, if an export declaration has been made in respect of goods, authority to deal with the goods in accordance with the declaration may be refused until an officer doing duty in relation to export declarations has verified particulars of the goods shown in the declaration:

                     (a)  by reference to information contained in commercial documents relating to the goods that have been given to Customs by the owner of the goods on, or at any time after, the communication of the declaration to Customs; or

                     (b)  by reference to information, in writing, in respect of the goods that has been so given to Customs.

             (2)  If an officer doing duty in relation to export declarations believes, on reasonable grounds, that the owner of goods to which an export declaration relates has custody or control of commercial documents, or has, or can obtain, information, relating to the goods that will assist the officer to determine whether this Act has been or is being complied with in respect of the goods, the officer may require the owner:

                     (a)  to deliver to the officer the commercial documents in respect of the goods that are in the owner’s possession or under the owner’s control (including any such documents that had previously been delivered to an officer and had been returned to the owner); or

                     (b)  to deliver to the officer such information, in writing, relating to the goods (being information of a kind specified in the notice) as is within the knowledge of the owner or as the owner is reasonably able to obtain.

             (3)  A documentary requirement for the delivery of documents or information in respect of an export declaration must:

                     (a)  be communicated to the person by whom, or on whose behalf, the declaration was communicated; and

                     (b)  be in an approved form and contain such particulars as the form requires.

             (4)  An electronic requirement for the delivery of documents or information in respect of an export declaration must:

                     (a)  be sent electronically to the person who made the declaration; and

                     (b)  communicate such particulars as are set out in an approved statement.

             (5)  An officer doing duty in relation to export declarations may ask:

                     (a)  the owner of goods in respect of which an export declaration has been made; and

                     (b)  if another person made the declaration on behalf of the owner—the other person;

any questions relating to the goods.

             (6)  An officer doing duty in relation to export declarations may require the owner of goods in respect of an export declaration that has been made to verify the particulars shown in the export declaration by making a declaration or producing documents.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  the owner of goods has been required to deliver documents or information in relation to the goods under subsection (2); or

                     (b)  the owner of, or person who made an export declaration in respect of, goods has been asked a question in respect of the goods under subsection (5); or

                     (c)  the owner of goods has been required under subsection (6) to verify a matter in respect of the goods;

authority to deal with the relevant goods in accordance with the declaration must not be granted unless:

                     (d)  the requirement referred to in paragraph (a) has been complied with or withdrawn; or

                     (e)  the question referred to in paragraph (b) has been answered or withdrawn; or

                      (f)  the requirement referred to in paragraph (c) has been complied with or withdrawn;

as the case requires.

             (8)  Subject to section 215, if a person delivers a commercial document to an officer doing duty in relation to export declarations under this section, the officer must deal with the document and then return it to that person.

             (1)  A person who:

                     (a)  proposes to make an export declaration relating to particular goods or is likely to make, from time to time, export declarations in relation to goods of a particular kind; and

                     (b)  will be unable to include in the export declaration or export declarations particular information in relation to the goods because the information cannot be ascertained until after the exportation of the goods;

may apply to the CEO for confirming exporter status in respect of the information and the goods.

             (2)  An application under subsection (1) must:

                     (a)  be in writing; and

                     (c)  contain such particulars as are required by the form including the reasons the information referred to in subsection (1) cannot be ascertained before exportation.

             (3)  Where a person applies for confirming exporter status in respect of particular information and particular goods or goods of a particular kind, the CEO must:

                     (a)  if the CEO is satisfied that the information cannot be ascertained before exportation—grant the applicant that status by signing a notice stating:

                              (i)  that the applicant is granted that status in respect of that information and those goods; and

                             (ii)  that the grant is on such conditions as are specified in the notice; or

                     (b)  if the CEO is not so satisfied—refuse to grant the applicant that status by signing a notice stating that the CEO has refused to grant the applicant that status and setting out the reasons for the refusal.

             (4)  A grant of confirming exporter status has effect from the day on which the relevant notice is signed.

             (5)  Without limiting the generality of the conditions to which a grant of confirming exporter status may be subject, those conditions must be expressed to include:

                     (a)  a requirement that the appropriate confirming exporter status will be specified in any export declaration relating to the goods in respect of which the status was granted where the confirming exporter proposes to rely on that status; and

                     (b)  a requirement that full details of the information in respect of which the status was granted will be provided as soon as practicable after exportation and not later than the time the CEO indicates in the notice granting the status; and

                     (c)  a requirement that, if information in respect of which the status was granted becomes, to the knowledge of the confirming exporter, able to be ascertained before the exportation of goods in respect of which the status was granted, the confirming exporter will notify the CEO forthwith.

             (6)  Where the CEO is satisfied that information in respect of which confirming exporter status was granted is now able to be ascertained before exportation, he or she must sign a notice in writing:

                     (a)  cancelling the confirming exporter status forthwith; or

                     (b)  modifying the confirming exporter status so that it no longer relates to that information.

             (7)  Where a person granted a confirming exporter status in respect of information and goods fails to comply with a condition to which the grant is subject, the person is guilty of an offence.

                    Penalty:  10 penalty units.

          (7A)  Subsection (7) does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse.

          (7B)  Subsection (7) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (8)  Where:

                     (a)  a person who is a confirming exporter in respect of information and goods of a particular kind is convicted of an offence against subsection (7); or

                     (b)  the CEO becomes satisfied that a person who is such a confirming exporter has failed to comply with a condition of a grant of confirming exporter status although no proceedings for an offence against subsection (7) have been brought against the person;

the CEO may:

                     (c)  cancel that person’s status in respect of that information and those goods; or

                     (d)  modify that person’s status so that it no longer relates to specified information or goods or so that the conditions to which it is subject are altered in a specified respect;

by signing a notice stating that that status has been so cancelled or modified and setting out the reasons for that cancellation or modification.

             (9)  A cancellation or modification of the confirming exporter status of a person has effect on the day the relevant notice was signed.

           (10)  The CEO must, as soon as practicable after signing a notice under subsection (3), (6) or (8), serve a copy of the notice on the person concerned but a failure to do so does not alter the effect of the notice.

             (6)  If a person makes, by the use of an ACEAN, a communication that relates to more than one consignment of goods:

                     (a)  the use of the ACEAN is invalid and does not constitute an entry of any of the goods for export; and

                     (b)  the person is guilty of an offence punishable, on conviction, by a penalty not exceeding 60 penalty units.

             (7)  An offence against paragraph (6)(b) is an offence of strict liability.

##### <a id="132B"></a>132B  Declared period quotas—effect on rates of import duty

             (1)  If at any time the CEO is of the opinion that, for the reason that persons are anticipating, or may anticipate, an increase in the rate of duty applicable to goods of a particular kind, the quantity of goods of that kind that may be entered for home consumption during a period is likely to be greater than it would otherwise be, the CEO may, by notice published in the _Gazette_, declare that that period is, for the purposes of this section, a declared period with respect to goods of that kind.

             (2)  The CEO shall, in a notice under subsection (1) declaring that a period is a declared period for the purposes of this section, specify in the notice another period being a period ending before the commencement of the declared period, as the base period in relation to the declared period.

             (3)  Where the CEO makes a declaration under subsection (1) specifying a declared period in respect of goods of any kind, he or she may, in respect of that kind of goods, or goods of a kind included in that kind of goods, make an order in writing (in this Act referred to as a **_quota order_**) applicable to a person specified in the order, being an order that states that the person’s quota, for the declared period, in respect of goods of the kind to which the order relates is such quantity as is specified in the order or is nil, and, subject to subsection (4) of this section, the order comes into force forthwith.

             (4)  Where, during a declared period, a person enters goods for home consumption, being goods of a kind in respect of which there is no quota order in force that is applicable to that person for the declared period, the CEO may, before authority to deal with the goods is given under section 71C or 71DE and whether or not the declared period has expired, make, under subsection (3), a quota order that is applicable to that person for that declared period in respect of goods of that kind, and a quota order so made shall, unless the contrary intention appears in the order, be deemed to have come into force immediately before the time of entry of the goods.

             (5)  In making a quota order under subsection (3), or revoking or varying a quota order under section 132C, with respect to a person, the CEO shall have regard to the quantity of goods (if any) of the kind to which the order relates that, at any time or times during the period that is the base period with respect to the declared period to which the order relates or during any other period that the CEO considers relevant, the person has entered for home consumption, and to such other matters as the CEO considers relevant.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  at any time during a declared period, a person has entered any goods (in this section referred to as the **_relevant goods_**) for home consumption, being goods of a kind in respect of which there is in force at the time of entry of the goods a quota order that states that the person’s quota in respect of goods of that kind is a quantity specified in the order;

                     (b)  the quantity of the relevant goods so entered, together with goods (if any) of that kind previously entered for home consumption by the person during the declared period, exceeds the quota; and

                     (c)  the amount of import duty paid or payable on the relevant goods at the rate of duty in force at the time of entry of the goods is less than the amount of duty applicable to those goods in accordance with the rate of duty in force on the day immediately following the last day of the declared period;

the rate of import duty payable on the relevant goods, or on so much of the relevant goods as, together with goods (if any) of that kind previously entered for home consumption by the person during the declared period, exceeds the quota, is the rate of duty in force on the day immediately following the last day of the declared period.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  at any time during a declared period, a person has entered any goods for home consumption, being goods of a kind in respect of which there is in force at the time of entry of the goods a quota order that states that the person’s quota in respect of goods of that kind is nil; and

                     (b)  the amount of import duty paid or payable on those goods at the rate of duty in force at the time of entry of the goods is less than the amount of duty applicable to those goods in accordance with the rate of duty in force on the day immediately following the last day of the declared period;

the rate of import duty payable on the goods is the rate of duty in force on the day immediately following the last day of the declared period.

             (8)  Where at any time during a declared period, a person enters any goods for home consumption, being goods of a kind in respect of which there is in force at the time of entry of the goods a quota order that is applicable to that person for the declared period, the Customs shall have the right, before authority to deal with the goods is given under section 71C or 71DE, in addition to requiring import duty to be paid on the goods at the rate in force at that time of entry of the goods, to require and take, for the protection of the revenue of the Customs in relation to any additional amount of duty that may become payable on the goods, or on a part of the goods, by virtue of the operation of subsection (6) or (7), security by way of cash deposit of an amount equal to the amount of duty payable on the goods, or on that part of the goods, at the rate in force at the time of entry of the goods.

             (1)  The CEO may, by writing under his or her hand, revoke or vary a quota order at any time before the expiration of the declared period to which the quota order relates.

             (2)  Where a quota order is revoked by the CEO under this section, the revocation shall be deemed to have taken effect on the day on which the order came into force.

             (3)  The revocation of a quota order under this section does not prevent the making of a further quota order that is applicable to the person to whom the revoked quota order was applicable and that has effect with respect to the declared period in respect of which the revoked quota order had effect, whether or not the kind of goods to which the further quota order relates is the same as the kind of goods to which the revoked quota order related.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), a variation of a quota order under this section shall, for the purposes of section 132B, be deemed to have had effect on and from the day on which the quota order came into force.

             (5)  Where:

                     (a)  a quota order applicable to a person states that the person’s quota in respect of goods of the kind to which the order relates is a quantity specified in the order; and

                     (b)  the CEO varies the order in such a way that the order specifies a lesser quantity or states that the person’s quota is nil;

the variation has effect on and from the day on which it is made.

##### <a id="132D"></a>132D  Service of quota orders etc.

                   The CEO shall, as soon as practicable after he or she makes a quota order or revokes or varies a quota order, cause a copy of the quota order or of the revocation or variation, as the case may be, to be served on the person to whom the quota order is applicable.

General rule for determining allowable expenditure of a factory on materials

             (1)  Subject to the exceptions set out in this section, the allowable expenditure of a factory on materials in respect of preference claim goods is the cost to the manufacturer of those materials in the form they are received at the factory, worked out under section 153E.

Goods wholly or partly manufactured from materials imported from outside the qualifying area

             (2)  If:

the allowable expenditure of the factory on those particular materials in the form they are received at the factory does not include any part of the cost of those particular materials to the manufacturer, worked out under section 153E, that is attributable to the cost of those contributing materials in the form in which the contributing materials were received by the person who subjected them to their first manufacturing process in the qualifying area after importation.

Intervening export of contributing materials

             (5)  If contributing materials within the meaning of subsection (4) are, after their importation into a country in the qualifying area and before their incorporation into the particular materials from which preference claim goods are manufactured, subsequently exported to a country outside that area, then, on their reimportation into a country in the qualifying area, subsection (2) or (4), as the case requires, applies as if that subsequent reimportation were the only importation of those materials.

          (6A)  If:

                     (a)  goods claimed to be the manufacture of Papua New Guinea or a particular Forum Island Country are manufactured, in whole or in part, from particular materials; and

                     (b)  if the qualifying area for that country consisted only of that country and Australia—under subsection (4), the allowable expenditure of the factory on those particular materials, after excluding any costs required to be excluded under subsection (4), would be at least 50% of the total expenditure of the factory on those particular materials worked out in accordance with section 153C;

then, despite subsection (4), the allowable expenditure of the factory on those particular materials is taken to be that total expenditure.

Waste or scrap

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  materials are imported into a country; and

                     (b)  the subjecting of those materials to a process of manufacture gives rise to waste or scrap; and

                     (c)  that waste or scrap is fit only for the recovery of raw materials;

any raw materials that are so recovered in that country are to be treated, for the purposes of this section, as if they were unmanufactured raw products of that country.

##### <a id="153E"></a>153E  Calculation of the cost of materials received at a factory

Purpose of section

             (1)  This section sets out, for the purposes of sections 153C and 153D, the rules for working out the cost of materials in the form they are received at a factory.

General rule

             (2)  Subject to this section, the cost of materials received at a factory is the amount paid or payable by the manufacturer in respect of the materials in the form they are so received.

Customs and excise duties and certain other taxes to be disregarded

             (3)  Any part of the cost of materials in the form they are received at a factory that represents:

                     (a)  a customs or excise duty; or

                     (b)  a tax in the nature of a sales tax, a goods and services tax, an anti‑dumping duty or a countervailing duty;

imposed on the materials by a country in the qualifying area is to be disregarded.

CEO may require artificial elements of cost to be disregarded

             (4)  If the CEO is satisfied that preference claim goods consist partly of materials added or attached solely for the purpose of artificially raising the allowable factory cost of the goods, the CEO may, by written notice given to the importer of the preference claim goods, require the part of that cost that is, in the CEO’s opinion, reasonably attributable to those materials, to be disregarded.

CEO may require cost over normal market value to be disregarded

             (5)  If the CEO is satisfied that the cost to the manufacturer of materials in the form they are received at a factory exceeds, by an amount determined by the CEO, the normal market value of the materials, the CEO may, by written notice given to the importer of preference claim goods in which those materials are incorporated, require the excess to be disregarded.

CEO may determine cost of certain materials received at a factory

             (6)  If the CEO is satisfied:

                     (a)  that materials in the form they are received at a factory are so received:

                              (i)  free of charge; or

                             (ii)  at a cost that is less than the normal market value of the materials; and

                     (b)  that the receipt of the materials free of charge or at a reduced cost has been arranged, directly or indirectly, by a person who will be the importer of preference claim goods in which those materials are incorporated;

the CEO may, by written notice given to the importer, require that an amount determined by the CEO to be the difference between the cost, if any, paid by the manufacturer and the normal market value be treated as the amount, or a part of the amount, paid by the manufacturer in respect of the materials.

Effect of determination

             (7)  If the CEO gives a notice to the importer of preference claim goods under subsection (4), (5) or (6) in respect of materials incorporated in those goods, the cost of the materials to the manufacturer must be determined having regard to the terms of that notice.

##### <a id="153F"></a>153F  Allowable expenditure of factory on labour

Calculation of allowable expenditure of factory on labour

             (1)  Allowable expenditure of a factory on labour in respect of preference claim goods means the sum of the part of each cost prescribed for the purposes of this subsection:

                     (b)  that relates, directly or indirectly, and wholly or partly, to the manufacture of the goods; and

                     (c)  that can reasonably be allocated to the manufacture of the goods.

Regulations may specify manner of working out cost

             (2)  Regulations prescribing a cost for the purposes of subsection (1) may also specify the manner of working out that cost.

##### <a id="153G"></a>153G  Allowable expenditure of factory on overheads

                     (b)  that relates, directly or indirectly, and wholly or partly, to the manufacture of the goods; and

                     (c)  that can reasonably be allocated to the manufacture of the goods.

Regulations may specify manner of working out cost

             (2)  Regulations prescribing a cost for the purposes of subsection (1) may also specify the manner of working out that cost.

                     (b)  if the goods are of a kind for which the CEO has determined, by _Gazette_ notice, that a lesser percentage is appropriate—that percentage.

##### <a id="153LA"></a>153LA  Modification of section 153L in special circumstances

When 50% in subsection 153L(4) can be read as 48%

             (1)  If the CEO is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the allowable factory cost of preference claim goods in a shipment of such goods that are claimed to be the manufacture of Papua New Guinea or a Forum Island Country is at least 48% but not 50% of the total factory cost of those goods; and

                     (b)  that the allowable factory cost of those goods would be at least 50% of the total factory cost of those goods if an unforeseen circumstance had not occurred; and

                     (c)  that the unforeseen circumstance is unlikely to continue;

the CEO may determine, in writing, that section 153L has effect:

                     (d)  for the purpose of the shipment of goods that is affected by that unforeseen circumstance; and

                     (e)  for the purposes of any subsequent shipment of similar goods that is so affected during a period specified in the determination;

as if the reference in subsection 153L(4) to 50% were a reference to 48%.

Effect of determination

             (2)  If the CEO makes a determination, then, in relation to all preference claim goods imported into Australia that are covered by the determination, section 153L has effect in accordance with the determination.

CEO may revoke determination

##### <a id="153YE"></a>153YE  Goods (except clothing and textiles) produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia from non‑originating materials

             (1)  Goods are **_US originating goods_** if:

                     (a)  a tariff classification (the **_final classification_**) that is specified in column 2 of the Schedule 1 tariff table applies to the goods; and

                     (b)  they are produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from non‑originating materials only or from non‑originating materials and originating materials; and

                     (c)  if any of the following 3 requirements apply in relation to the goods—that requirement is satisfied.

First requirement

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the first requirement applies only if a change in tariff classification is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods. The first requirement is that:

                     (a)  each of the non‑originating materials satisfies the transformation test (see subsection (8)); or

                     (b)  the following are satisfied:

                              (i)  the total value of all the non‑originating materials, that do not satisfy the transformation test (see subsection (8)), does not exceed 10% of the customs value of the goods;

                             (ii)  if one or more of the non‑originating materials are prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph—each of those non‑originating materials satisfies the transformation test (see subsection (8)).

Note 1:       Paragraph (2)(b) relates to Article 5.2 (De Minimis) of the Agreement.

Note 2:       The value of the non‑originating materials is to be worked out in accordance with the regulations: see subsection 153YA(2).

             (3)  However, the first requirement does not apply if:

                     (a)  an alternative requirement to the change in tariff classification is also specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods; and

                     (b)  that alternative requirement is satisfied.

Second requirement

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), the second requirement applies only if a regional value content requirement is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods. The second requirement is that the goods satisfy that regional value content requirement.

             (5)  However, the second requirement does not apply if:

                     (a)  an alternative requirement to the regional value content requirement is also specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods; and

                     (b)  that alternative requirement is satisfied.

             (6)  The regulations may prescribe different regional value content requirements for different kinds of goods.

Third requirement

             (7)  The third requirement is that the goods satisfy any other requirement that is specified in, or referred to in, column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods.

Transformation test

             (8)  A non‑originating material satisfies the transformation test if:

                     (a)  it satisfies the change in tariff classification that is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 1 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods; or

                     (b)  it does not satisfy the change in tariff classification mentioned in paragraph (a), but it was produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from other non‑originating materials, and each of those materials satisfies the transformation test (including by one or more applications of this subsection).

Note 1:       Paragraph (8)(b) relates to paragraph 2 of Article 5.3 (Accumulation) of the Agreement.

Note 2:       Subsection (8) operates in a recursive manner: a non‑originating material may satisfy the transformation test in its own right, or it may satisfy it because each non‑originating material used to produce it satisfies the transformation test (whether because each of those materials does so in its own right, or because each non‑originating material used to produce the material does so), and so on.

##### <a id="153YF"></a>153YF  Goods that are chemicals, plastics or rubber

                   Goods are **_US originating goods_** if:

                     (a)  they are produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from non‑originating materials only or from non‑originating materials and originating materials; and

                     (b)  they are goods that are classified to any of Chapters 28 to 40 of the Harmonized System; and

                     (c)  a tariff classification (the **_final classification_**) that is specified in column 2 of the Schedule 1 tariff table applies to the goods; and

                     (d)  before the tariff classifications in column 2 of that table in relation to Chapter 28 or 39 of the Harmonized System, the regulations specify particular rules in column 3 of that table; and

                     (e)  those rules apply in relation to the final classification for the goods; and

                      (f)  the goods satisfy those rules.

#### Subdivision E—Goods that are clothing or textiles produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia from non‑originating materials

##### <a id="153YG"></a>153YG  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Subdivision:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      This Subdivision sets out

when goods that are clothing or textiles that are produced entirely in the US, or in the US and Australia, from non‑originating materials only, or from non‑originating

materials and originating materials, are US originating goods.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The goods may be US

originating goods under section 153YH (which applies to all clothing and

textiles).</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The goods may also be US

originating goods under section 153YI (which applies only to clothing and

textiles classified to Chapter 62 of the Harmonized System).</li>

* * *

##### <a id="153YH"></a>153YH  Goods that are clothing or textiles produced entirely in the US or in the US and Australia from non‑originating materials

             (1)  Subject to subsection (5), goods are **_US originating goods_** if:

                     (a)  a tariff classification (the **_final classification_**) that is specified in column 2 of the Schedule 2 tariff table applies to the goods; and

                     (b)  they are produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from non‑originating materials only or from non‑originating materials and originating materials; and

                   (ba)  if the component of the goods that determines the final classification for the goods contains elastomeric yarns—the elastomeric yarns are produced entirely in the US or Australia; and

                     (c)  if any of the following 2 requirements apply in relation to the goods—that requirement is satisfied.

Note 1:       Subsection (5) sets out a qualification for goods put up in a set for retail sale.

Note 2:       Paragraph (1)(ba) relates to paragraph 7 of Article 4.2 (Rules of origin and related matters) of the Agreement.

First requirement

             (2)  The first requirement applies only if a change in tariff classification is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 2 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods. The first requirement is that:

                     (a)  subject to subsection (3), each of the non‑originating materials satisfies the transformation test (see subsection (7)); or

                     (b)  the following are satisfied:

                              (i)  the total weight of all the relevant non‑originating materials (see subsection (8)) does not exceed 7% of the total weight of the component of the goods that determines the final classification for the goods;

                             (ii)  if one or more of the non‑originating materials are prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph—each of those non‑originating materials satisfies the transformation test (see subsection (7)).

Note:          Paragraph (2)(b) relates to paragraph 6 (De Minimis) of Article 4.2 of the Agreement.

             (3)  In relation to goods classified to Chapter 61, 62 or 63 of the Harmonized System, paragraph (2)(a) is to be applied by applying:

                     (a)  for goods covered by Chapter 61 of the Harmonized System—Chapter Rule 2 for Chapter 61 that is set out in the Schedule 2 tariff table; and

                     (b)  for goods covered by Chapter 62 of the Harmonized System—Chapter Rule 3 for Chapter 62 that is set out in the Schedule 2 tariff table; and

                     (c)  for goods covered by Chapter 63 of the Harmonized System—Chapter Rule 1 for Chapter 63 that is set out in the Schedule 2 tariff table.

Second requirement

             (4)  The second requirement is that the goods satisfy any other requirement that is specified in, or referred to in, column 3 of the Schedule 2 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods.

Goods put up in a set for retail sale

             (5)  However, if:

                     (a)  the goods are put up in a set for retail sale; and

                     (b)  the goods are classified in accordance with Rule 3 of the Interpretation Rules;

the goods are **_US originating goods_** only if:

                     (c)  all of the goods in the set are US originating goods under this Division; or

                     (d)  the total value of the goods in the set that are not US originating goods under this Division does not exceed 10% of the customs value of the set of goods.

Note:          The value of the goods in the set is to be worked out in accordance with the regulations: see subsection 153YA(2).

             (6)  In applying paragraph (5)(c), assume the goods were not part of a set.

Example:    A skirt and a belt are put up in a set for retail sale. The skirt and the belt have been classified under Rule 3 of the Interpretation Rules according to the tariff classification applicable to skirts.

                   The effect of subsection (6) is that the origin of the belt must now be determined according to the tariff classification applicable to belts.

Transformation test

             (7)  A non‑originating material satisfies the transformation test if:

                     (a)  it satisfies the change in tariff classification that is specified in column 3 of the Schedule 2 tariff table opposite the final classification for the goods; or

                     (b)  it does not satisfy the change in tariff classification mentioned in paragraph (a), but it was produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from other non‑originating materials, and each of those materials satisfies the transformation test (including by one or more applications of this subsection).

Note 1:       Paragraph (7)(b) relates to paragraph 2 of Article 5.3 (Accumulation) of the Agreement.

Note 2:       Subsection (7) operates in a recursive manner: a non‑originating material may satisfy the transformation test in its own right, or it may satisfy it because each non‑originating material used to produce it satisfies the transformation test (whether because each of those materials does so in its own right, or because each non‑originating material used to produce the material does so), and so on.

             (8)  In this section:

                    <a name="relev-non-originating-materi"></a>**_relevant non‑originating materials_**, in relation to goods, means non‑originating materials that:

                     (a)  are used to produce the component of the goods that determines the final classification for the goods; and

                     (b)  do not satisfy the transformation test (see subsection (7)).

##### <a id="153YI"></a>153YI  Goods that are clothing and textiles classified to Chapter 62 of the Harmonized System

                   Goods are **_US originating goods_** if:

                     (a)  they are produced entirely in the US, or entirely in the US and Australia, from non‑originating materials only or from non‑originating materials and originating materials; and

                     (b)  they are goods that are classified to Chapter 62 of the Harmonized System; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  in any case—the goods satisfy Chapter Rule 2 for Chapter 62 that is set out in the Schedule 2 tariff table; or

                             (ii)  in the case of goods that are classified to subheading 6205.20 or 6205.30 of Chapter 62 of the Harmonized System—the goods satisfy the subheading rule for that subheading that is set out in the Schedule 2 tariff table.

#### Subdivision F—Other US originating goods

##### <a id="153YJ"></a>153YJ  Standard accessories, spare parts and tools

             (1)  If goods (the **_underlying goods_**) are imported into Australia with standard accessories, standard spare parts or standard tools, then the accessories, spare parts or tools are **_US originating goods_** if:

                     (a)  the underlying goods are US originating goods; and

                     (b)  the accessories, spare parts or tools are not invoiced separately from the underlying goods; and

                     (c)  the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts or tools are the usual quantities and value in relation to the underlying goods.

             (2)  In working out if the underlying goods are US originating goods, if the goods must satisfy a regional value content requirement under Subdivision D, the regulations must require the value of the accessories, spare parts or tools to be taken into account for the purposes of that requirement.

Note:          The value of the accessories, spare parts or tools is to be worked out in accordance with the regulations: see subsection 153YA(2).

#### Subdivision G—Packaging materials and containers

##### <a id="153YK"></a>153YK  Packaging materials and containers

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  goods are packaged for retail sale in packaging material or a container; and

                     (b)  the packaging material or container is classified with the goods in accordance with Rule 5 of the Interpretation Rules;

then the packaging material or container is to be disregarded for the purposes of this Division (with 1 exception).

             (2)  The exception is that in working out if the goods are US originating goods, if the goods must satisfy a regional value content requirement under Subdivision D, the regulations must require the value of the packaging material or container to be taken into account for the purposes of that requirement.

Note:          The value of the packaging material or container is to be worked out in accordance with the regulations: see subsection 153YA(2).

#### Subdivision H—Consignment

##### <a id="153YL"></a>153YL  Consignment

             (1)  Goods are not US originating goods under this Division if:

                     (a)  they are transported through a country or place other than the US or Australia; and

                     (b)  they undergo any process of production, or any other operation, in that country or place (other than unloading, reloading, any operation to preserve them in good condition or any operation that is necessary for them to be transported to Australia).

             (2)  This section applies despite any other provision of this Division.

Change in tariff classification

             (2)  The regulations may make it a requirement (the **_tariff change requirement_**) that each non‑originating material (if any) used to produce the goods must satisfy a particular change in tariff classification. The regulations may also set out when a non‑originating material is taken to satisfy that change.

             (3)  The tariff change requirement is also taken to be satisfied if the total value of all the non‑originating materials that:

                     (a)  do not satisfy the particular change in tariff classification; and

                     (b)  the accessories, spare parts or tools are imported solely for the purpose of artificially raising the regional value content of the underlying goods.

Underlying goods

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the underlying goods must satisfy a regional value content requirement under section 153ZD to be Thai originating goods; and

                     (b)  the accessories, spare parts or tools are not imported solely for the purpose of artificially raising the regional value content of the underlying goods;

then the regulations must require the value of the accessories, spare parts or tools to be taken into account for the purposes of that requirement.

                              (i)  if the Collector determines, in writing, that he or she is not so satisfied and that he or she does not desire to use the method—the Collector shall thereupon be taken to be unable to use that method; and

                             (ii)  if the Collector determines, in writing, that he or she is not so satisfied but that he or she desires to use the method—the Collector may use the method but no deduction shall be allowed on account of that amount.

##### <a id="161"></a>161  Transaction value

             (1)  The transaction value of imported goods is an amount equal to the sum of their adjusted price in their import sales transaction and of their price related costs to the extent that those costs have not been taken into account in determining the price of the goods.

                              (i)  was not, at the time of the sale, related to the vendor of the comparable goods; and

                             (ii)  did not incur any production assist costs in relation to the comparable goods; and

                     (d)  that was, in the opinion of the Collector, a sale of a sufficient number of units of comparable goods as to permit an appropriate determination of their price per unit.

                    <a name="refer-sale"></a>**_reference sale_**, in relation to comparable goods, means:

                     (a)  where there was only one contemporary sale of the goods—that sale;

                     (a)  reduced by the sum of value unrelated amounts, deductible administrative costs, and deductible financing costs, in relation to the comparable goods; and

                     (b)  divided by the number of units of the comparable goods.

             (3)  The following example illustrates the operation of paragraph (c) of the definition of **_reference sale_** in subsection (2): 

_Facts:_

There were 2 contemporary sales of 5 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $100.

There were 6 contemporary sales of 3 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $40.

There was one contemporary sale of 4 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $40.

There was one contemporary sale of 7 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $60.

There were 3 contemporary sales of 2 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $60.

This means that:

10 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $100.

22 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $40.

13 units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $60.

_Result:_

More units of comparable goods were sold in contemporary sales at $40 than were sold in such sales at any other unit price.

Therefore, the reference sales are the sales at the unit price of $40.

             (4)  The following example illustrates the operation of paragraph (e) of the definition of **_reference sale_** in subsection (2):

_Facts_:

There was one contemporary sale of 10 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $60.

There were 2 contemporary sales of 2 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $20.

There was one contemporary sale of 6 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $20.

There were 8 contemporary sales of 1 unit of comparable goods at a unit price of $80.

There was one contemporary sale of 5 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $70.

There were 2 contemporary sales of 2 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $70.

There were 2 contemporary sales of 1 unit of comparable goods at a unit price of $50.

There were 2 contemporary sales of 4 units of comparable goods at a unit price of $50.

_Result_:

An equal number of units of comparable goods (10) were sold in contemporary sales at 3 unit prices ($60, $20, $50).

This number is not exceeded by 8 units of comparable goods sold in contemporary sales at $80 or by 9 units of comparable goods sold in contemporary sales at $70.

Therefore, reference sales are the sales at the unit price of $20.

                              (i)  if one of the sales on the common day was of a higher number of units of the comparable goods than the other or others on the common day—that sale of a higher number; or

                             (ii)  if 2 or more of the sales on the common day were of the same number of units of comparable goods and no other sale on the common day was of a higher number of such units—whichever of those 2 or more sales of the same number of units was the sale in which comparable goods were sold at the lower or lowest unit price.

##### <a id="161G"></a>161G  Fall‑back value

                   The fall‑back value of imported goods is such value as a Collector determines, having regard to the other methods of valuation under this Division in the order in which those methods would ordinarily be considered under section 159 and of such other matters as the Collector considers relevant, but not having regard to any of the following matters:

                     (b)  has, in accordance with subsection (3), (5) or (7), decided that the transaction value of the goods cannot be determined; or

                     (c)  is satisfied that the disposition or use of the goods by the purchaser is subject to restrictions, not being restrictions of the following kinds:

                              (i)  restrictions imposed or required by, or by any public officer or authority acting in accordance with, any law in force in Australia;

                             (ii)  restrictions that limit the geographical area in which the goods may be sold;

             (2)  Where, in relation to goods required to be valued, a Collector:

                     (a)  is satisfied that the purchaser and the vendor of imported goods were, at the time of the goods’ import sales transaction, related persons; and

                     (b)  considers that that relationship may have influenced the price of the goods;

the Collector shall, by notice in writing served, personally or by post, on the purchaser of the goods:

                     (c)  advise the purchaser of:

                              (i)  the view that the Collector has formed of the possible effect on the price of the goods of the relationship between the purchaser and the vendor;

                             (ii)  the reasons for forming that view; and

                            (iii)  the fact that, because of that view, the Collector may be required to decide under subsection (3) that the transaction value of the goods cannot be determined; and

                     (d)  invite the purchaser to put before the Collector, within a period specified in the notice (not being a period of less than 28 days), such further information as the purchaser considers might serve to satisfy the Collector as to any of the matters set out in subsection (3).

             (3)  On the expiration of the period specified in a notice under subsection (2), the Collector shall, unless the purchaser of the imported goods has satisfied the Collector that:

                     (a)  a relationship between the purchaser and the vendor of the goods did not influence the price of the goods; or

                     (b)  the amount of the transaction value that would be determined in respect of the goods if the purchaser and the vendor had not been related at the time of the import sales transaction for the goods divided by the number of the units of the goods closely approximates, having regard to all relevant factors:

                              (i)  the unit price within the meaning of section 161A of identical goods that were exported to Australia about the same time as the imported goods;

                             (ii)  the unit price within the meaning of section 161B of similar goods that were exported to Australia about the same time as the imported goods;

                            (iii)  the unit price of identical goods or similar goods sold in a contemporary sale within the meaning of section 161C as determined in accordance with that section; or

                            (iv)  the computed unit price of identical goods or similar goods that were imported into Australia about the same time as the imported goods being the computed value of those identical or similar goods determined in accordance with section 161F divided by the number of units of those identical or similar goods;
