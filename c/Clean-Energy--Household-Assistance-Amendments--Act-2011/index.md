Add:

### Division 8—Adjustments relating to clean energy household assistance

##### <a id="1206GF"></a>1206GF  Special rules for indexation of certain rates on or after 20 March 2013

             (1)  The indexation factor for an amount set out in subsection (2) on an indexation day on or after 20 March 2013 is to be reduced by the brought forward CPI indexation amount, but not below 1.

Note:          Once the brought forward CPI indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the factor.

Example:    Assume that the indexation factor worked out under section 1193 on 20 March 2013 is 1.003\. The brought forward CPI indexation amount in relation to 20 March 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 20 March 2013.

                   Further assume that on 20 September 2013 the indexation factor is 1.010\. The brought forward CPI indexation amount in relation to 20 September 2013 is 0.004\. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.006 on 20 September 2013.

                   The brought forward CPI indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the amounts are as follows:

                     (a)  pension MBR;

                     (b)  PS rate;

                     (c)  PS minimum rate;

                     (d)  PS basic rate;

                     (e)  benefit MBR (ordinary);

                      (f)  pension supplement component for pension bonus;

                     (g)  maximum transitional pension rates.

             (3)  The living cost indexation factor worked out under section 1197:

                     (a)  for pension MBR, except to the extent that pension MBR covers the maximum basic rate for pension PP (single); and

                     (b)  for each indexation day on or after 20 March 2013;

is to be reduced by the brought forward PBLCI indexation amount, but not below 1.

Note:          Once the brought forward PBLCI indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the factor.

Example:    Assume that the living cost indexation factor worked out under section 1197 on 20 March 2013 is 1.003\. The brought forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to 20 March 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 20 March 2013.

                   Further assume that on 20 September 2013 the living cost indexation factor is 1.010\. The brought forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to 20 September 2013 is 0.004\. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.006 on 20 September 2013.

                   The brought forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the living cost indexation factor.

             (4)  Neither paragraph (2)(a), nor subsection (3), affect:

                     (a)  the rate of a payment worked out under clause 146 of Schedule 1A; or

                     (b)  an amount worked out in relation to a pension because of clause 149 of that Schedule.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="brought-forward-cpi-index-amount"></a>**_brought forward CPI indexation amount_**, in relation to a day, means:

                     (a)  if subsection (3) applies for the amount, and the brought forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to the day is 0—0; and

                     (b)  otherwise—0.007 less any reduction made under subsection (1) for a previous day.

                    <a name="index-amount"></a><a name="brought-forward-pblci"></a>**_brought forward PBLCI_** **_indexation amount_**, in relation to a day, means:

                     (a)  if the brought forward CPI indexation amount in relation to the day is 0—0; and

                     (b)  otherwise—0.007 less any reduction made under subsection (3) for a previous day.

##### <a id="1206GG"></a>1206GG  Special rules for indexation of certain rates on or after 1 January 2014

             (1)  The indexation factor for AP MBR or YA MBR on an indexation day on or after 1 January 2014 is to be reduced by the brought forward indexation amount, but not below 1.

             (2)  In this section:

                    <a name="brought-forward-index-amount"></a>**_brought forward indexation amount_**, in relation to a day, means 0.007 less any reduction made under this section for a previous day.

Note:          Once the brought forward indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the factor.

Example:    Assume that the indexation factor worked out under section 1193 on 1 January 2014 is 1.003\. The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 January 2014 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 1 January 2014.

                   Further assume that on 1 January 2015 the indexation factor is 1.010\. The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 January 2015 is 0.004\. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.006 on 1 January 2015.

                   The brought forward indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

                             (ii)  the main rate would be reduced as described in paragraph (1)(b);

the person’s quarterly clean energy supplement is reduced to the same extent (if any) that the component of the main rate that would correspond to the person’s clean energy supplement would be reduced under subsection (1) were quarterly clean energy supplement not payable to the person.

Note:          The reduction may be disregarded unless the person’s quarterly clean energy supplement is reduced to nil (see subsection 43(5B) of the Administration Act).

### Division 2—Amount of clean energy advance

##### <a id="105"></a>105  Amount of advance where entitlement under section 103

             (1)  On the day (the **_decision day_**) that the Secretary determines that an individual is entitled to a clean energy advance under section 103, the Secretary must work out the amount of the advance.

Secretary determines entitlement before 1 July 2012

             (2)  If the decision day is before 1 July 2012, the amount of the individual’s clean energy advance is, subject to subsections (5) and (6), worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the individual’s clean energy daily rate (see section 106) on the decision day (assuming that any rate or amount that is to be indexed on 1 July 2012 had already been indexed on the decision day).

Step 2.   Multiply the amount at step 1 by 365: the result is the amount of the individual’s clean energy advance.

* * *

Secretary determines entitlement in the 2012‑13 income year

             (3)  If the decision day is on or after 1 July 2012 and before 1 July 2013, the amount of the individual’s clean energy advance is, subject to subsections (5) and (6), worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the sum of the individual’s clean energy daily rates (see section 106) for each day in the period beginning on 1 July 2012 and ending on the decision day.

Step 2.   Multiply the individual’s clean energy daily rate on the decision day by the number of days in the 2012‑13 income year that are after the decision day.

Step 3.   Work out the sum of the amounts at steps 1 and 2: the result is the amount of the individual’s clean energy advance.

* * *

Secretary determines entitlement on or after 1 July 2013

             (4)  If the decision day is on or after 1 July 2013, the amount of the individual’s clean energy advance is, subject to subsections (5) and (6), the sum of the individual’s clean energy daily rates (see section 106) for each day in the 2012‑13 income year.

Reduced amount if rate took account of a section 28 or 29 percentage determination

             (5)  If, in relation to any of the following days:

                     (a)  if the decision day is before 1 July 2012—the decision day;

                     (b)  if the decision day is on or after 1 July 2012 and before 1 July 2013—a day in the period beginning on 1 July 2012 and ending on the decision day;

                     (c)  if the decision day is on or after 1 July 2013—a day in the 2012‑13 income year;

a determination under section 28 or 29 of a particular percentage in relation to one or more FTB children of the individual is in effect, the clean energy daily rate for that day is that percentage of the clean energy daily rate that would otherwise apply.

Legislative instrument

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  an individual is entitled to a clean energy advance under section 103 in relation to an FTB child; and

                     (b)  before the decision day in relation to the individual, a former partner of the individual was entitled to a clean energy advance under section 103 or 108 in relation to that FTB child; and

                     (c)  at the time the former partner became so entitled, the individual and the former partner were members of the same couple;

then:

                     (d)  subsections (2) to (5) do not apply in relation to working out the amount of the individual’s clean energy advance; and

                     (e)  the amount of the individual’s clean energy advance is worked out in accordance with an instrument made under subsection (7) (which may be nil).

             (7)  The Minister may, by legislative instrument, specify a method for working out the amount of clean energy advances for the purposes of subsection (6).

##### <a id="106"></a>106  Clean energy daily rate

             (1)  An individual’s **_clean energy daily rate_** for a day is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   If the individual’s rate of family tax benefit on that day (disregarding reductions (if any) under clause 5 or 25A of Schedule 1) consisted of or included a Part A rate greater than nil:

               (a)     if the Part A rate is worked out under clause 3 of Schedule 1 and the individual’s income and maintenance tested rate exceeds the individual’s base rate—work out the sum of the amounts at paragraphs (a) and (ca) of step 1 of the method statement in that clause; or

              (b)     if the Part A rate is worked out under clause 3 of Schedule 1 and the individual’s income and maintenance tested rate is less than or equal to the individual’s base rate—work out the sum of the amounts at paragraphs (a) and (d) of step 1 of the method statement in clause 25 of that Schedule; or

               (c)     if the Part A rate is worked out under clause 25 of Schedule 1 and the individual’s Method 2 income and maintenance tested rate is less than or equal to the individual’s provisional Part A rate—work out the sum of the amounts at paragraphs (a) and (d) of step 1 of the method statement in that clause; or

              (d)     if the Part A rate is worked out under clause 25 of Schedule 1 and the individual’s Method 2 income and maintenance tested rate exceeds the individual’s provisional Part A rate—work out the sum of the amounts at paragraphs (a) and (ca) of step 1 of the method statement in clause 3 of that Schedule.

Step 2.   If the individual’s rate of family tax benefit on that day consisted of or included a Part B rate greater than nil, work out whichever of the following amounts is appropriate:

               (a)     the sum of the amounts under paragraphs 29(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 1;

              (b)     the sum of the amounts at paragraphs (a) and (b) of step 1 of the method statement in subclause 29(2) of Schedule 1;

               (c)     the sum of the amounts under paragraphs 29A(2)(a) and (b) of Schedule 1.

Step 3.   Work out the sum of the amounts at steps 1 and 2.

Step 4.   Multiply the amount at step 3 by 0.017.

Step 5.   Divide the amount at step 4 by 365 (rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards)): the result is the individual’s **_clean energy daily rate_** for that day.

* * *

             (2)  If steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in subsection (1) do not apply in relation to an individual on a day, the individual’s **_clean energy daily rate_** for that day is nil.

             (3)  An individual’s **_clean energy daily rate_** for a day is nil if the individual is an absent overseas recipient on that day (disregarding section 63A).

             (4)  The calculation under subsection (1) for a day is to be done disregarding any FTB child of the individual who is an absent overseas FTB child (disregarding section 63A) on that day.

             (5)  The calculation under subsection (1) is to be done disregarding section 32.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the decision day (see subsection 105(1)) is before 1 July 2013; and

                     (b)  on the decision day:

                              (i)  an FTB child of the individual is outside Australia and the FTB child left Australia before 1 April 2013; and

                             (ii)  that FTB child is not an absent overseas FTB child (disregarding section 63A);

then the calculation under subsection (1) of this section on the decision day is to be done disregarding that FTB child.

             (7)  If the child referred to in subsection (6) returns to Australia before 1 July 2013, then, for the purposes of section 108, there is taken to be a change in the individual’s circumstances on the day of the child’s return.

             (8)  If the child referred to in subsection (6) does not return to Australia before 1 July 2013, then, for the purposes of section 108, there is taken to be a trigger day of 30 June 2013 in relation to the individual.

##### <a id="107"></a>107  Amount of advance where entitlement under section 104

                   If the Secretary makes a determination under subsection 104(1) that an individual is entitled to a clean energy advance, the amount of the advance is the amount referred to in subparagraph 104(1)(b)(i) or (ii) (as the case requires).

### Division 3—Top‑up payments of clean energy advance

##### <a id="108"></a>108  Top‑up payments of clean energy advance

General case

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Secretary pays a clean energy advance (the **_original payment_**) to an individual in circumstances where the Secretary determined the individual is entitled to the advance under section 103 and where the amount of the advance is not worked out under subsection 105(6); and

                     (b)  the decision day (see subsection 105(1)) is before 1 July 2013; and

                     (c)  on a day (the **_trigger day_**) after the decision day and before 1 July 2013, the individual’s circumstances change so that:

                              (i)  if the individual has not previously become entitled to a payment under this section—the amount of the original payment is less than the amount of the clean energy advance that would have been paid to the individual if the decision day had been the trigger day; or

                             (ii)  if the individual has previously become entitled to one or more payments under this section—the sum of those payments and the original payment is less than the amount of the clean energy advance that would have been paid to the individual if the decision day had been the trigger day;

then the individual is entitled to a further payment of clean energy advance equal to the amount of the shortfall.

Case involving former partner

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the Secretary pays a clean energy advance (the **_original payment_**) to an individual in circumstances where the Secretary determined the individual is entitled to the advance under section 103 and where the amount of the advance is worked out under subsection 105(6); and

                     (b)  the decision day (see subsection 105(1)) is before 1 July 2013; and

                     (c)  on a day after the decision day and before 1 July 2013, the individual’s circumstances change; and

                     (d)  the individual is entitled to a further payment of clean energy advance in accordance with an instrument made under subsection (3);

then the amount of the individual’s further clean energy advance is worked out in accordance with an instrument made under subsection (3) (which may be nil).

             (3)  The Minister may, by legislative instrument:

                     (a)  specify the circumstances in which individuals are entitled to further payments of clean energy advances for the purposes of subsection (2); and

                     (b)  specify a method for working out the amount of further clean energy advances for the purposes of subsection (2).

Interpretation

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, there is taken not to be a change in the individual’s circumstances merely because a determination under section 28 in relation to the individual is varied or ceases to be in force.

### Division 4—General rules

##### <a id="109"></a>109  General rules

                   If:

                     (a)  an individual is entitled to a clean energy advance under section 103 or 108 in relation to an FTB child; and

                     (b)  the amount of the advance was not worked out by applying subsection 105(5);

then, while the individual is a member of a couple, the other member of the couple is not entitled to a clean energy advance under section 103 or 108 in relation to that child.

                     (b)  in such manner as the Secretary considers appropriate.

Note:          The individual does not have to make a claim for the advance.

             (2)  If:

                     (b)  on that day, section 32AA or 32AD of this Act prevents the Secretary from making a payment of family tax benefit to the individual, or the individual’s partner, worked out on the basis referred to in subsection 20(1), (2A) or (3) of this Act;

then the Secretary must not pay the clean energy advance to the individual at a time that is earlier than the time family tax benefit is paid to the individual, or the individual’s partner, in relation to that day.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the decision day (see subsection 105(1) of the Family Assistance Act) is on or after 1 July 2013; and

                     (b)  in relation to one or more days in the 2012‑13 income year, section 32AA or 32AD of this Act prevents the Secretary from making a payment of family tax benefit to the individual, or the individual’s partner, worked out on the basis referred to in subsection 20(1), (2A) or (3) of this Act;

Add:

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Adjustment of indexation factor for certain amounts on and after 1 July 2013

             (1)  This clause applies to the following amounts:

                     (a)  FTB child rate (A1);

                     (b)  FTB child rate (A2);

                     (c)  FTB standard rate (B);

                     (d)  FTB standard ACO rate.

             (2)  For each amount to which this clause applies, the indexation factor, worked out under clause 5 for each indexation day that is on or after 1 July 2013, is to be reduced by the brought forward indexation amount, but not below 1.

             (3)  In this clause:

                    <a name="brought-forward-index-amount"></a>**_brought forward indexation amount_**, in relation to an indexation day, means 0.007 less any reduction made under this clause for a previous indexation day.

Note:          Once the brought forward indexation amount becomes zero, there will be no further reduction of the indexation factor.

Example:    Assume that the indexation factor worked out under clause 5 on 1 July 2013 is 1.004\. The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 July 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 1 July 2013.

                   Further assume that on 1 July 2014 the indexation factor is 1.010\. The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 July 2014 is 0.003\. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.007 on 1 July 2014.

                   The brought forward indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now zero so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Adjustment of indexation factor for certain amounts on and after 1 July 2014

             (1)  This clause applies to the following amounts:

                     (a)  FTB gross supplement amount (A);

                     (b)  FTB gross supplement amount (B).

             (2)  For each amount to which this clause applies, the indexation factor, worked out under clause 5 for each indexation day (a **_reduction day_**) that is on or after 1 July 2014, is to be reduced by the brought forward indexation amount, but not below 1.

             (3)  In this clause:

                    <a name="brought-forward-index-amount"></a>**_brought forward indexation amount_**, in relation to a reduction day, means 0.007 less:

                     (a)  any reduction made under subclause 10(2) on 1 July 2013; and

                     (b)  any reduction made under this clause for a previous reduction day.

Note:          Once the brought forward indexation amount becomes zero, there will be no further reduction of the indexation factor.

Example:    Assume that the indexation factor worked out under clause 5 on 1 July 2014 is 1.010 and that there was a reduction of 0.004 under subclause 10(2) on 1 July 2013.

                   The brought forward indexation amount in relation to 1 July 2014 is 0.003\. The indexation factor worked out under clause 5 on 1 July 2014 is reduced to 1.007.

                   The brought forward indexation amount in relation to later reduction days is now zero so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

are eligible for a further payment, of the amount worked out in accordance with the instrument, of the clean energy advance.

             (2)  This subsection covers a person’s circumstances changing in a way such that:

                     (a)  immediately after the change the Commission could still have determined that the person would have been eligible for a clean energy advance for the original underlying payment, had the Commission not already made such a determination; and

                     (b)  had the amount of the original payment been worked out by reference to the person’s circumstances immediately after the change, the clean energy advance daily rate that would have been used for working out that amount would have been greater than the rate actually used for working out that amount.

             (3)  This subsection covers a change in a person’s circumstances that, apart from a multiple entitlement exclusion, would (if any necessary administrative decisions were made) entitle the person to a clean energy bonus, under an Act or a scheme, relating to a payment other than the original underlying payment.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), a **_multiple entitlement exclusion_** is an instrument that:

                     (a)  provides a person is not entitled to a clean energy bonus under an Act or a scheme because of the person’s entitlement to or receipt of the original payment or the original underlying payment; and

                     (b)  is made under:

                              (i)  section 65A; or

                             (ii)  section 424L of the MRCA; or

                            (iii)  section 918 of the Social Security Act;

                            or is an instrument establishing entitlements to a clean energy bonus under a scheme.

             (5)  An instrument under subsection (1) may provide for:

                     (a)  different periods for changes in circumstances depending on different changes in circumstances; and

                     (b)  different ways of working out further amounts of the original payment depending on different changes in circumstances.

#### Subdivision D—Payment of clean energy advance

##### <a id="61G"></a>61G  Payment of clean energy advance

             (1)  An amount of clean energy advance for which a person is eligible is payable in a single lump sum on the day that the Commission considers to be the earliest day on which it is reasonably practicable for the amount to be paid.

             (2)  However, the clean energy advance is not payable if the Commission is aware that the person has died.

#### Subdivision E—Debts

##### <a id="61H"></a>61H  Debts relating to clean energy advances

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a person has been paid a clean energy advance for a clean energy underlying payment; and

                     (b)  after the advance was paid, one of the following events happens to a determination that directly or indirectly affected the payability or amount of the clean energy advance paid to the person:

                              (i)  the determination is changed, revoked or set aside;

                             (ii)  the determination is superseded by another determination; and

                     (c)  the event happened wholly or partly because the person knowingly made a false or misleading statement or knowingly provided false information; and

                     (d)  had the event happened on or before the day the advance was paid:

                              (i)  the advance would not have been paid; or

                             (ii)  the advance would have been reduced.

Note 1:       Examples of determinations directly affecting the payability or amount of the clean energy advance include:

(a)    a determination relating to the person’s eligibility for the clean energy underlying payment to which the advance related; and

(b)    the determination of the person’s eligibility for the clean energy advance.

Note 2:       An example of a determination indirectly affecting the amount of the advance is a determination relating to a change in circumstances that results in the person becoming eligible for a further payment of the advance under an instrument made under section 61F.

Creation and amount of debt

             (2)  The advance is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person if subparagraph (1)(d)(i) applies.

             (3)  The amount by which the advance would have been reduced is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person if subparagraph (1)(d)(ii) applies.

Relationship with other sections

             (4)  The other provisions of this Act under which debts arise do not apply in relation to clean energy advances to which this section applies.

             (5)  A debt that arises under this section is a recoverable amount within the meaning of subsection 205(8).

### Division 5—Multiple entitlement exclusions

##### <a id="65A"></a>65A  Multiple entitlement exclusions

             (1)  The Commission may by legislative instrument determine that persons in circumstances specified in the instrument are not entitled to a clean energy bonus under this Act that is specified in the instrument.

Note:          For **_clean energy bonus_** see subsection 5Q(1).

             (2)  Those circumstances must relate to persons’ entitlement to or receipt of one or more of the following:

                     (a)  another clean energy bonus under this Act;

                     (b)  a clean energy bonus under the MRCA;

                     (c)  a clean energy bonus under the Social Security Act;

                     (d)  a clean energy bonus under a scheme (however described), whether or not the scheme is provided for by or under an Act.

             (3)  An instrument under subsection (1) has effect according to its terms, despite any other provision of this Act.

When clean energy supplement is to be added

 SCH6‑BB1  A clean energy supplement is to be added to the person’s maximum basic rate (of service pension) if the person is residing in Australia and:

                     (a)  is in Australia; or

                     (b)  is temporarily absent from Australia and has been so for a continuous period not exceeding 13 weeks.

Note:          Section 65A may affect the addition of the clean energy supplement.

 SCH6‑BB2  However, this Module does not apply if quarterly clean energy supplement for service pension is payable to the person.

Amount of clean energy supplement

 SCH6‑BB3  The person’s clean energy supplement is worked out by:

                     (a)  applying the applicable percentage in the following table to the clean energy pension rate; and

                     (b)  rounding the result of paragraph (a) up or down to the nearest multiple of $2.60 (rounding up if that result is not a multiple of $2.60 but is a multiple of $1.30).

Indexation of rates relating to clean energy supplements

             (9)  This Act has effect as if, on each adjustment day on or after 20 September 2013, there were substituted, for each of the following rates:

                     (a)  CES 22(3) rate;

                     (b)  CES 22(4) rate;

##### <a id="198MA"></a>198MA  Adjustment of indexation factor under section 59D for limited time on and after 20 March 2013 for certain purposes

Application

             (1)  This section applies for purposes connected with the following payments on or after 20 March 2013:

                     (a)  a service pension;

                     (b)  seniors supplement;

                     (c)  a pension under Part II or IV at a rate determined under or by reference to Division 4 of Part II or subsection 30(1);

                     (d)  Special Rate Disability Pension under the MRCA;

                     (e)  compensation under Division 2 (Compensation for member’s death for wholly dependent partners) of Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MRCA.

Note 1:       Section 198 of the MRCA sets Special Rate Disability Pension by reference to the rate of pension under section 24 of this Act (so indexation of amounts affecting that rate also affects that pension).

Note 2:       Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MRCA sets compensation under that Division by reference to the rate of pension under subsection 30(1) of this Act (so indexation of amounts affecting that rate also affects the compensation).

Adjustment of indexation factor

             (2)  An indexation factor that:

                     (a)  is worked out under section 59D on a day that is on or after 20 March 2013; and

                     (b)  is directly or indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by:

                              (i)  subsection 5GA(1) (which provides for the PS rate mentioned in table item 2 of section 59A); or

                             (ii)  subsection 5GA(2) (which provides for the PS minimum rate mentioned in table item 2A of section 59A); or

                            (iii)  subsection 5GA(4) (which provides for the PS basic rate mentioned in table item 2B of section 59A); or

                            (iv)  subsection 22(3) or (4), 23(4) or 24(4); or

                             (v)  paragraph 30(1)(a) or (b); or

                            (vi)  table item 2 of point SCH6‑B1 of the Rate Calculator (which provides for the pension MBR mentioned in table item 1 of section 59A);

is, for the purposes of the indexation of such an amount on that day, to be reduced by the brought‑forward CPI indexation amount, but not below 1.

Note 1:       An indexation factor worked out under section 59D is indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by subsection 22(3) or (4), 23(4) or 24(4) or paragraph 30(1)(b). This is because:

(a)    section 198 provides for indexation of such an amount by reference to the pension MBR factor worked out under section 59LA; and

(b)    the pension MBR factor depends on the increase in the single pension rate MBR amount, which in turn depends (under section 59G) on indexation of the pension MBR amount under section 59C, which involves the indexation factor worked out under section 59D.

Note 2:       An indexation factor worked out under section 59D is indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by paragraph 30(1)(a). This is because that amount is affected by indexation under section 59G, which in turn depends on indexation under section 59C.

Note 3:       Once the brought‑forward CPI indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the indexation factor.

Example:    Assume that the indexation factor worked out under section 59D on 20 March 2013 is 1.005\. The brought‑forward CPI indexation amount in relation to 20 March 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 20 March 2013.

                   Further assume that on 20 September 2013 the indexation factor is 1.010\. The brought‑forward CPI indexation amount in relation to 20 September 2013 is 0.002\. That indexation factor is reduced to 1.008 on 20 September 2013.

                   The brought‑forward CPI indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

Definition of **brought‑forward CPI indexation amount**

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="brought-forward-cpi-index-amount"></a>**_brought‑forward CPI indexation amount_** for a day means:

                     (a)  0.007 less any reduction made under subsection (2) for an earlier day; or

                     (b)  0 if the brought‑forward PBLCI indexation amount for the day under section 198MB is 0.

                     (b)  a pension under Part II or IV at a rate determined under or by reference to section 22, 23 or 24 or subsection 30(1);

                     (c)  Special Rate Disability Pension under the MRCA;

                     (d)  compensation under Division 2 (Compensation for member’s death for wholly dependent partners) of Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MRCA.

Note 1:       Section 198 of the MRCA sets Special Rate Disability Pension by reference to the rate of pension under section 24 of this Act (so indexation of amounts affecting that rate also affects that pension).

Note 2:       Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MRCA sets compensation under that Division by reference to the rate of pension under subsection 30(1) of this Act (so indexation of amounts affecting that rate also affects the compensation).

Adjustment of living cost indexation factor

             (2)  A living cost indexation factor that:

                     (a)  is worked out under section 59EAB on a day that is on or after 20 March 2013; and

                     (b)  is directly or indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by:

                              (i)  subsection 22(3) or (4), 23(4) or 24(4); or

                             (ii)  paragraph 30(1)(a) or (b); or

                            (iii)  table item 2 of point SCH6‑B1 of the Rate Calculator (which provides for the pension MBR mentioned in table item 1 of section 59A);

is, for the purposes of the indexation of such an amount on that day, to be reduced by the brought‑forward PBLCI indexation amount, but not below 1.

Note 1:       A living cost indexation factor worked out under section 59EAB is indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by subsection 22(3) or (4), 23(4) or 24(4) or paragraph 30(1)(b). This is because:

(a)    section 198 provides for indexation of such an amount by reference to the pension MBR factor worked out under section 59LA; and

(b)    the pension MBR factor depends on the increase in the single pension rate MBR amount, which in turn depends (under section 59G) on indexation of the pension MBR amount under section 59C, which may involve the living cost indexation factor worked out under section 59EAB.

Note 2:       A living cost indexation factor worked out under section 59EAB is indirectly relevant to the indexation of an amount provided for by paragraph 30(1)(a). This is because that amount is affected by indexation under section 59G, which in turn depends on indexation under section 59C.

Note 3:       Once the brought‑forward PBLCI indexation amount becomes 0, there will be no further reduction of the living cost indexation factor.

Example:    Assume that the living cost indexation factor worked out under section 59EAB on 20 March 2013 is 1.005\. The brought‑forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to 20 March 2013 is 0.007 (as there has been no previous reduction). That living cost indexation factor is reduced to 1 on 20 March 2013.

                   Further assume that on 20 September 2013 the living cost indexation factor is 1.010\. The brought‑forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to 20 September 2013 is 0.002\. That living cost indexation factor is reduced to 1.008 on 20 September 2013.

                   The brought‑forward PBLCI indexation amount in relation to later indexation days is now 0 so there is no further reduction of the indexation factor.

Definition of **brought‑forward PBLCI indexation amount**

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="brought-forward-pblci-index-amount"></a>**_brought‑forward PBLCI indexation amount_** for a day means:

                     (a)  0.007 less any reduction made under subsection (2) for an earlier day; or

                     (b)  0 if the brought‑forward CPI indexation amount for the day under section 198MA is 0.

## 58  At the end of Part 5 of Schedule 5

Add:

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Special rules for indexation of rates payable under clause 30

             (1)  This clause applies if clause 30 affects the rate at which service pension is payable to a person for a day on or after 20 March 2013.

             (2)  Subsection 198MA(2), and the definition of **_brought forward CPI indexation amount_** (except paragraph (b) of that definition) in subsection 198MA(3), apply in relation to the amount described in subparagraph 30(4)(a)(i) of this Schedule for the person in the same way as they apply in relation to the person’s PS minimum rate.

             (3)  The following provisions do not affect the rate of the person’s service pension worked out under clause 30 or an amount worked out in relation to the person’s pension because of clause 34:

                     (a)  subparagraph 198MA(2)(b)(vi);

                     (b)  section 198MB.

For Special Rate Disability Pension

             (2)  The **_clean energy advance daily rate_** for Special Rate Disability Pension is the same as that rate worked out under subsection 61D(1) of the _Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986_ for a pension at a rate determined under subsection 24(4) of that Act.

For compensation under Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 5

             (3)  The **_clean energy advance daily rate_** for compensation under Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 5 is the same as that rate worked out under subsection 61D(4) of the _Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986_ for a pension at a rate determined under subsection 30(1) of that Act.

                     (a)  who have been paid the amount (the **_original payment_**) of a specified clean energy advance for a clean energy underlying payment (the **_original underlying payment_**) worked out under Division 2; and

                     (b)  whose circumstances change, within a period specified in the instrument, in a way that is specified in the instrument and is covered by subsection (2) or (3);

are eligible for a further payment, of the amount worked out in accordance with the instrument, of the clean energy advance.

             (2)  This subsection covers a person’s circumstances changing in a way such that:

                     (a)  immediately after the change the Commission could still have determined that the person would have been eligible for a clean energy advance for the original underlying payment, had the Commission not already made such a determination; and

                     (b)  had the amount of the original payment been worked out by reference to the person’s circumstances immediately after the change, the clean energy advance daily rate that would have been used for working out that amount would have been greater than the rate actually used for working out that amount.

             (3)  This subsection covers a change in a person’s circumstances that, apart from a multiple entitlement exclusion, would (if any necessary administrative decisions were made) entitle the person to a clean energy bonus, under an Act or a scheme, relating to a payment other than the original underlying payment.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), a **_multiple entitlement exclusion_** is an instrument that:

                     (a)  provides a person is not entitled to a clean energy bonus under an Act or a scheme because of the person’s entitlement to or receipt of the original payment or the original underlying payment; and

                     (b)  is made under:

                              (i)  section 424L; or

                            or is an instrument establishing entitlements to a clean energy bonus under a scheme.

             (5)  An instrument under subsection (1) may provide for:

                     (a)  different periods for changes of circumstances depending on different changes in circumstances; and

                     (b)  different ways of working out further amounts of the original payment depending on different changes in circumstances.

### Division 4—Payment of clean energy advance

##### <a id="424J"></a>424J  Payment of clean energy advance

             (1)  An amount of clean energy advance for which a person is eligible is payable in a single lump sum on the day that the Commission considers to be the earliest day on which it is reasonably practicable for the advance to be made.

             (2)  However, the clean energy advance is not payable if the Commission is aware that the person has died.

### Division 5—Debts

##### <a id="424K"></a>424K  Debts relating to clean energy advances

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a person has been paid a clean energy advance for a clean energy underlying payment; and

                     (b)  after the advance was paid, one of the following events happens to a determination that directly or indirectly affected the payability or amount of the clean energy advance paid to the person:

                              (i)  the determination is changed, revoked or set aside;

                             (ii)  the determination is superseded by another determination; and

                     (c)  the event happened wholly or partly because the person knowingly made a false or misleading statement or knowingly provided false information; and

                     (d)  had the event happened on or before the day the advance was paid:

                              (i)  the advance would not have been paid; or

                             (ii)  the advance would have been reduced.

Note 1:       Examples of determinations directly affecting the payability or amount of the clean energy advance include:

(a)    a determination relating to the person’s eligibility for the clean energy underlying payment to which the advance related; and

(b)    the determination of the person’s eligibility for the clean energy advance.

Note 2:       An example of a determination indirectly affecting the amount of the advance is a determination relating to a change in circumstances that results in the person becoming eligible for a further payment of the advance under an instrument made under section 424H.

Creation and amount of debt

             (2)  The advance is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person if subparagraph (1)(d)(i) applies.

             (3)  The amount by which the advance would have been reduced is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the person if subparagraph (1)(d)(ii) applies.

Recovery of debt

             (4)  A debt under this section is recoverable by the Commission from the person in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (5)  The recoverable amount may be deducted from an amount that is payable to or for the benefit of the person under this Act.

### Division 6—Multiple entitlement exclusions

##### <a id="424L"></a>424L  Multiple entitlement exclusions

             (1)  The Commission may by legislative instrument determine that persons in circumstances specified in the instrument are not entitled to a clean energy bonus under this Act that is specified in the instrument.

Note:          For **_clean energy bonus_** see subsection 5(1).

             (2)  Those circumstances must relate to persons’ entitlement to or receipt of one or more of the following:

                     (a)  another clean energy bonus under this Act;

                     (b)  a clean energy bonus under the _Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986_;

                     (a)  the **_main income earner_** is:

                              (i)  if the individual is not a member of a couple—the individual; or

                             (ii)  if the individual is a member of a couple—the member of the couple whose taxable income for the income year is the highest (or the individual if those taxable incomes are equal); and

                     (b)  if the individual is a member of a couple—the **_low income earner_** is the member of the couple whose taxable income for the income year is the lowest (or the individual’s partner if those taxable incomes are equal).

Annual rate

             (3)  An individual’s annual rate of single income family supplement is nil if the main income earner’s taxable income for the income year (rounded down to the nearest dollar) is:

                     (a)  $68,000 or less; or

                     (b)  $150,000 or more.

             (4)  An individual’s annual rate of single income family supplement is worked out as follows if the main income earner’s taxable income for the income year (rounded down to the nearest dollar) is more than $68,000 and less than $150,000:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the main income earner’s taxable income (rounded down to the nearest dollar).

Step 2.   Reduce the amount at step 1 by $68,000.

Step 3.   Multiply the amount worked out at step 2 by 0.025.

Step 4.   If the amount at step 3 is less than or equal to $300, the provisional component is the amount at step 3.

Step 5.   If the amount at step 3 is more than $300, the provisional component is:

               (a)     if the main income earner’s taxable income exceeds $80,000 and is less than or equal to $120,000—$300; or

              (b)     if the main income earner’s taxable income exceeds $120,000—$300 less $0.01 for each dollar of the excess.

Step 6.   If the individual is not a member of a couple—the individual’s annual rate of single income family supplement is the provisional component.

Step 7.   If the individual is a member of a couple—the individual’s annual rate of single income family supplement is the provisional component less any reduction under step 8.

Step 8.   If the low income earner’s taxable income for the income year (rounded down to the nearest dollar) exceeds $16,000, the provisional component is reduced (but not below nil) by $0.15 for each dollar of the excess.

* * *

Daily rate

             (5)  The daily rate of single income family supplement is the annual rate divided by 365 and rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards). If the daily rate before rounding is above nil and below half a cent, round up to 1 cent.

##### <a id="84GA"></a>84GA  Sharing single income family supplement between members of a couple in a blended family

                   If the Secretary determines under section 57GC an individual’s percentage of the single income family supplement for qualifying children of the individual, the individual’s annual rate of single income family supplement is that percentage of the rate that would otherwise apply.

##### <a id="84GB"></a>84GB  Sharing single income family supplement between separated members of a couple for period before separation

                   If the Secretary determines under section 57GD an individual’s percentage of the single income family supplement for a qualifying child or children of the individual for a period, the individual’s annual rate of single income family supplement for that period is that percentage of the rate that would otherwise apply for the period.

Statement of tax file number

             (2)  The first kind of statement that can be made is a statement of the TFN determination person’s tax file number. Regardless of who the TFN determination person is, this kind of statement can be made by the claimant only.

Statement that TFN person does not know what his or her tax file number is etc.

             (3)  The second kind of statement that can be made is a statement by the TFN determination person that the person:

                     (a)  has a tax file number but does not know what it is; and

                     (b)  has asked the Commissioner of Taxation to inform the person of his or her tax file number; and

                     (b)  the claimant does not comply with the request within 28 days of the request being made;

then, subject to subsection (2), the consequence in subsection (7) applies.

Exemption from request under subsection 65KR(1)

             (2)  The Secretary may determine that the consequence in subsection (7) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the TFN determination person concerned is or was the claimant’s partner; and

                     (b)  the claimant cannot obtain from the person:

                              (i)  the person’s tax file number; or

                             (ii)  a statement by the person under subsection 65KR(3) or (4).

                     (b)  by the end of 28 days after the request is made, the claimant gives the Secretary a statement by the TFN determination person of the kind set out in subsection 65KR(3); and

                     (c)  the Commissioner of Taxation subsequently tells the Secretary that the TFN determination person has no tax file number;

the consequence in subsection (7) applies.

Statement made by TFN determination person under subsection 65KR(4)

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the Secretary makes a request under subsection 65KR(1); and

the consequence in subsection (7) applies.

Consequence—variation of determination

             (7)  For the purposes of subsection (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6), the consequence is that the Secretary may, if the determination is one under which the claimant is entitled to be paid single income family supplement for a past period, vary the determination so that it has the effect that the claimant is not entitled to be paid single income family supplement for any day in the past period.

Consequence of Secretary later becoming aware of tax file number
