##### <a id="86"></a>86  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Australian carbon credit

units may be required to be relinquished if:</li>

               (a)     the issue of the units is attributable to the giving of false or misleading information; or

              (b)     the units were issued in relation to a sequestration offsets project, and the declaration of the sequestration offsets project as an eligible offsets project has been revoked; or

               (c)     the units were issued in relation to a sequestration offsets project, and there has been a complete or partial reversal of sequestration.

* * *

##### <a id="87"></a>87  Maximum potential relinquishment period

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, the **_maximum potential relinquishment period_** for an eligible offsets project is:

                     (a)  a project of a kind specified in a methodology determination in accordance with paragraph 106(1)(a) should be covered by the additionality test regulations;

                     (b)  to the extent to which a method specified in a methodology determination in accordance with paragraph 106(1)(c) or (d) involves ascertaining any of the following:

                              (i)  the removal of one or more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere;

                             (ii)  the reduction of emissions of one or more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere;

                            (iii)  the emission of one or more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere;

                            the removal, reduction or emission, as the case may be, should be:

                            (iv)  measurable; and

                             (v)  capable of being verified;

                     (c)  a method specified in a methodology determination in accordance with paragraph 106(1)(c) or (d) should not be inconsistent with the methods set out in the National Inventory Report;

                              (i)  the carbon dioxide equivalent net abatement amount for a project;

                             (ii)  the carbon dioxide equivalent net sequestration amount for a project;

                            there is to be a deduction of the carbon dioxide equivalence of the amount that, under the determination, is taken to be the total amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted from any source or sources as a consequence of carrying out the project;

                      (f)  a method specified in a methodology determination in accordance with paragraph 106(1)(c) or (d) in relation to a sequestration offsets project should provide for adjustments to take account of significant cyclical variations that are likely to occur in the amount of carbon sequestered in the relevant carbon pool on the project area or project areas during:

                              (i)  a 100‑year period; or

                             (ii)  if, at the time when the methodology determination was made, another period was specified in the regulations—that other period;

                     (g)  to the extent to which a method specified in a methodology determination in accordance with paragraph 106(1)(c) or (d) involves an estimate, projection or assumption—the estimate, projection or assumption should be conservative;

                     (h)  if:

                             (a)  a method determined under subsection 10(3) of the _National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007_ is a method by which the amounts of the emissions of greenhouse gases from a particular source are to be measured for the purposes of that Act; and

                             (b)  a method specified in a methodology determination in accordance with paragraph 106(1)(c) or (d) involves the measurement of emissions of greenhouse gases from that source;

                            the methodology determination should provide that the emissions are to be measured, under the method specified in the methodology determination in accordance with paragraph 106(1)(c) or (d), in the same way as they are measured under the method determined under subsection 10(3) of the _National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007_.

Note 1:       For the additionality test, see section 41.

Note 2:       The permanence of sequestration is dealt with in the following provisions of this Act:

(a)    sections 16 and 17 provide for a risk of reversal buffer;

(b)    sections 90 and 91 provide for relinquishment of Australian carbon credit units in the event of a reversal of sequestration;

(c)    Part 8 provides for carbon maintenance obligations.

             (2)  Paragraph (1)(f) does not apply to a sequestration offsets project of a kind specified in the regulations.

             (3)  Subsection (2) of this section does not, by implication, limit the application of subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ to another instrument under this Act.

Civil enforcement of penalty

             (6)  A pecuniary penalty is a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth.

The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.

##### <a id="222"></a>222  Who may apply for a civil penalty order

##### <a id="226"></a>226  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   The Court must not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="227"></a>227  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to  constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the order are dismissed.

##### <a id="228"></a>228  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person.

##### <a id="229"></a>229  Evidence given in proceedings for a civil penalty order not admissible in criminal proceedings

                   Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

##### <a id="230"></a>230  Mistake of fact

             (1)  A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

                              (i)  considered whether or not facts existed; and

                             (ii)  was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

                     (b)  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

                     (a)  the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

             (3)  A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

##### <a id="232"></a>232  Continuing contraventions
