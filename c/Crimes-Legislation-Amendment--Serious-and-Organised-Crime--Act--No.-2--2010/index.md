##### <a id="318A"></a>318A  Admissibility in proceedings of statements made at examination by absent witness

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if direct evidence by a person (the **_absent witness_**) of a matter would be admissible in a proceeding before a court:

                     (a)  on an application for an order under this Act; or

                     (b)  ancillary to such an application; or

                     (c)  for the enforcement of an order made under this Act.

Admissibility of statements made at examination

             (2)  A statement that the absent witness made at an * examination of the absent witness and that tends to establish the matter is admissible in the proceeding as evidence of the matter:

                     (a)  if it appears to the court that:

                              (i)  the absent witness is dead or is unfit, because of physical or mental incapacity, to attend as a witness; or

                             (ii)  the absent witness is outside the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his or her attendance; or

                            (iii)  all reasonable steps have been taken to find the absent witness but he or she cannot be found; or

                     (b)  if it does not so appear to the court—unless another party to the proceeding requires the party tendering evidence of the statement to call the absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and the tendering party does not so call the absent witness.

Rules that apply if statement admitted

             (3)  The rules in subsections (4) to (6) apply if evidence of a statement is admitted under subsection (2).

             (4)  In deciding how much weight (if any) to give to the statement as evidence of a matter, regard is to be had to:

                     (a)  how long after the matters to which it related occurred the statement was made; and

                     (b)  any reason the absent witness may have had for concealing or misrepresenting a material matter; and

                     (c)  any other circumstances from which it is reasonable to draw an inference about how accurate the statement is.

             (5)  If the absent witness is not called as a witness in the proceeding:

                     (a)  evidence that would, if the absent witness had been so called, have been admissible in the proceeding for the purpose of destroying or supporting his or her credibility is so admissible; and

                     (b)  evidence is admissible to show that the statement is inconsistent with another statement that the absent witness has made at any time.

             (6)  However, evidence of a matter is not admissible under this section if, had the absent witness been called as a witness in the proceeding and denied the matter in cross‑examination, evidence of the matter would not have been admissible if adduced by the cross‑examining party.

##### <a id="318B"></a>318B  Objection to admission of statements made at examination

Adducing party to give notice

             (1)  A party (the **_adducing party_**) to a proceeding referred to in subsection 318A(1) may, not less than 14 days before the first day of the hearing of the proceeding, give another party to the proceeding written notice that the adducing party:

                     (b)  for that purpose, will apply to have evidence of those statements admitted in the proceeding.

             (2)  The notice must set out, or be accompanied by a written record of, the specified statements.

Other party may object to admission of specified statements

             (3)  The other party may, within 14 days after a notice is given under subsection (1), give the adducing party a written notice (an **_objection notice_**):

                     (b)  specifying, in relation to each of those statements, the grounds of objection.

             (4)  The period referred to in subsection (3) may be extended by the court before which the proceeding is to be heard or by agreement between the parties concerned.

Effect of giving objection notice

                     (a)  the notice under subsection (1) and any record under subsection (2); and

                     (b)  the objection notice.

             (6)  If subsection (5) is complied with, the court may either:

                     (a)  determine the objections as a preliminary point before the hearing of the proceeding begins; or

                     (b)  defer determination of the objections until the hearing.

Effect of not giving objection notice

             (7)  If a notice has been given in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), the other party is not entitled to object at the hearing of the proceeding to a statement specified in the notice being admitted in evidence in the proceeding, unless:

                     (a)  the other party has, in accordance with subsection (3), objected to the statement being so admitted; or

                     (b)  the court gives the other party leave to object to the statement being so admitted.

Object

                              (i)  the State offence is an ancillary offence that relates to a particular primary offence; and

                             (ii)  assuming that the provision creating the primary offence had been enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth instead of by the Parliament of the State—the provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (c)  assuming that the Parliament of the Commonwealth had enacted a provision that created an offence penalising the specific acts or omissions involved in committing the State offence—that provision would have been a valid law of the Commonwealth.

Specificity of acts or omissions

             (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(c), the specificity of the acts or omissions involved in committing a State offence is to be determined having regard to the circumstances in which the offence is committed (whether or not those circumstances are expressed to be elements of the offence).

             (4)  A State offence is taken to be covered by paragraph (2)(c) if the conduct constituting the State offence:

                             (ii)  insurance (other than State insurance not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or

                     (h)  relates to a matter outside Australia; or

                      (i)  relates to a matter in respect of which an international agreement to which Australia is a party imposes obligations to which effect could be given by the creation of an offence against the domestic laws of the parties to the agreement; or

                      (j)  relates to a matter that affects the relations between Australia and another country or countries or is otherwise a subject of international concern.

                     (a)  the person commits an offence against any law (the **_underlying offence_**); and

                     (b)  the person engaged in the conduct constituting the underlying offence at the direction of an organisation or of a member of an organisation; and

                     (c)  the organisation consists of 2 or more persons; and

                     (d)  the organisation’s aims or activities include facilitating the engagement in conduct, or engaging in conduct, constituting an offence against any law that is, or would if committed be, for the benefit of the organisation; and

                     (e)  the offence against any law mentioned in paragraph (d) is an offence against any law punishable by imprisonment for at least 3 years; and

                      (f)  the underlying offence is a constitutionally covered offence punishable by imprisonment for at least 12 months.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 7 years.

Fault elements

                     (b)  been the subject of an order under section 19B (Discharge of offenders without proceeding to conviction) of the _Crimes Act 1914_, or a corresponding law of a State, Territory or foreign country, relating to the underlying offence.

             (6)  If a person has been convicted or acquitted of a foreign offence in respect of conduct, the person cannot be convicted of an offence against this section in respect of that conduct.

Note:          If the underlying offence is an Australian offence, section 4C of the _Crimes Act 1914_ prevents the person from being punished twice under Australian law (once under this section and once under the Commonwealth, State or Territory law creating the underlying offence) for the act or omission constituting the underlying offence.

Likely benefits

             (7)  To avoid doubt, the person may be convicted of an offence against subsection (1) because the underlying offence is likely to result in the organisation or at least one member receiving benefits as described in the definition of **_for the benefit of_** in subsection 390.1(1), even if the organisation or member does not actually receive such a benefit.

                     (c)  on any ground if the Court of Appeal gives leave.

Decision on appeal

             (3)  The Court of Appeal must allow the appeal if the court thinks that:

## 3  Transitional provision

                     (a)  section 20BI of the _Crimes Act 1914_ does not apply in relation to the finding that was the subject of the appeal proceedings, despite item 2; and

                     (b)  the following provisions of the _Crimes Act 1958_ of Victoria, as in force immediately before their repeal by the _Criminal Procedure Act 2009_ of Victoria, continue to apply (as laws of the Commonwealth) in relation to the finding despite that repeal:

(2)       An instrument in force for the purposes of any of those provisions immediately before the repeal described in paragraph (1)(b) of the provision continues in force (despite that repeal) for the purposes of that provision as it continues to apply because of that paragraph.
