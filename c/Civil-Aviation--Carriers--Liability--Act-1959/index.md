##### <a id="11A"></a>11A  Limitation of liability for Australian international carriers

             (1)  Despite the terms of paragraph 1 of Article 22 of the Convention, but subject to the regulations relating to passenger tickets, the liability of an Australian international carrier under this Part in respect of each passenger, by reason of the passenger’s injury or death resulting from an accident, is limited to:

                     (a)  if neither paragraph (b) nor (c) applies—260,000 SDRs; or

                     (c)  if, at the date of the accident, no regulation was in force under paragraph (b) but the contract of carriage under which the passenger was carried specified the limit of the carrier’s liability as a number of SDRs that exceeds 260,000—the number of SDRs so specified; or

                     (d)  if, at the date of the accident, a regulation prescribing a number of SDRs exceeding 260,000 was in force under paragraph (b) but the contract of carriage under which the passenger was carried specified the limit of the carrier’s liability as a number of SDRs that exceeds the number so prescribed—the number of SDRs so specified.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Liability in respect of death

             (1)  The provisions of this section apply in relation to liability imposed by the Convention on a carrier in respect of the death of a passenger (including the injury that resulted in the death).

             (2)  Subject to section 14, the liability under the Convention is in substitution for any civil liability of the carrier under any other law in respect of the death of the passenger or in respect of the injury that has resulted in the death of the passenger.

             (3)  Subject to the next succeeding subsection, the liability is enforceable for the benefit of such of the members of the passenger’s family as sustained damage by reason of his or her death.

             (4)  To the extent that the damages recoverable include loss of earnings or profits up to the date of death, or funeral, medical or hospital expenses paid or incurred by the passenger before his or her death or by his or her personal representative, the liability is enforceable for the benefit of the personal representative of the passenger in his or her capacity as personal representative.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (3), the members of the passenger’s family shall be deemed to be the wife or husband, de facto spouse, parents, step-parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, half-brothers, half-sisters, children, step-children and grandchildren of the passenger, and, in ascertaining the members of the passenger’s family, an illegitimate person or an adopted person shall be treated as being, or as having been, the legitimate child of his mother and reputed father or, as the case may be, of his adoptors.

             (6)  The action to enforce the liability may be brought by the personal representative of the passenger or by a person for whose benefit the liability is, under the preceding provisions of this section, enforceable, but only one action shall be brought in Australia in respect of the death of any one passenger, and the action, by whomsoever brought, shall be for the benefit of all persons for whose benefit the liability is so enforceable who are resident in Australia or, not being resident in Australia, express the desire to take the benefit of the action.

             (7)  The damages recoverable in the action include loss of earnings or profits up to the date of death and the reasonable expenses of the funeral of the passenger and medical and hospital expenses reasonably incurred in relation to the injury that resulted in the death of the passenger.

             (8)  In awarding damages, the court or jury is not limited to the financial loss resulting from the death of the passenger.

             (9)  Subject to the next succeeding subsection, the amount recovered in the action, after deducting any costs not recovered from the defendant, shall be divided amongst the persons entitled in such proportions as the court (or, where the action is tried with a jury, the jury) directs.

           (10)  The court may at any stage of the proceedings make any such order as appears to the court to be just and equitable in view of the provisions of the Convention limiting the liability of the carrier and of any proceedings which have been, or are likely to be, commenced against the carrier, whether in or outside Australia.

           (11)  The second sentence of paragraph 4 of Article 22 of the Warsaw Convention, as amended by the Hague Protocol, shall not be construed as applying to an action to which this section applies that is wholly or partly for the benefit of a person or persons other than the plaintiff, but the court may, in such an action, deal with any question of costs in such manner as it thinks proper having regard to the operation of that sentence in cases to which it applies.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Liability in respect of injury

                   Subject to the next succeeding section, the liability of a carrier under the Convention in respect of personal injury suffered by a passenger, not being injury that has resulted in the death of the passenger, is in substitution for any civil liability of the carrier under any other law in respect of the injury.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Certain liabilities not excluded

                   Nothing in the Convention or in this Part shall be deemed to exclude any liability of a carrier:

                     (a)  to indemnify an employer of a passenger or any other person in respect of any liability of, or payments made by, that employer or other person under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory providing for compensation, however described, in the nature of workers’ compensation; or

                     (b)  to pay contribution to a tort-feasor who is liable in respect of the death of, or injury to, the passenger;

but this section does not operate so as to increase the limit of liability of a carrier in respect of a passenger beyond the amount fixed by or in accordance with the Convention.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Proceeds of insurance policies etc.

                   In assessing damages in respect of liability under the Convention there shall not be taken into account by way of reduction of the damages:

                     (a)  a sum paid or payable on the death of, or personal injury to, a passenger under a contract of insurance;

                     (b)  a sum paid or payable out of a superannuation, provident or like fund, or by way of benefit from a friendly society, benefit society or trade union;

                     (c)  any sum in respect of a pension, social service benefit or repatriation benefit paid or payable, consequent upon the death or injury, by any government or person;

                     (d)  in the case of death, any sum in respect of the acquisition by a spouse or child of the deceased, consequent upon the death, of, or of an interest in, a dwelling used at any time as the home of that spouse or child, or of, or of an interest in, the household contents of any such dwelling; or

                     (e)  in the case of death, a premium that would have become payable under a contract of insurance in respect of the life of the deceased passenger if he or she had lived after the time at which he or she died.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Contributory negligence

             (1)  Effect shall be given to Article 21 of the Warsaw Convention in accordance with the provisions of this section.

             (2)  If, in an action against a carrier under the Convention, the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the passenger or the consignor, the damages recoverable shall be assessed in accordance with this section.

             (3)  The court shall first determine the damages that would have been recoverable if there were no limit on the amount of those damages fixed by or in accordance with the Convention and there had been no negligence on the part of the passenger or consignor.

             (4)  The damages determined under the last preceding subsection shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the share of the passenger or the consignor in the responsibility for the damage.

             (5)  If the damages as reduced in accordance with the last preceding subsection exceed the maximum liability of the carrier fixed by or in accordance with the Convention, the court shall further reduce the damages to that maximum amount.

             (6)  Where any case to which subsection (2) applies is tried with a jury, the jury shall determine the damages referred to in subsection (3) and the amount of the reduction under subsection (4).

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Actions against Parties to the Convention who undertake carriage by air

             (1)  A Party to the Convention which has not availed itself of the provisions of the Additional Protocol to the Warsaw Convention with reference to Article 2 of that Convention shall, for the purposes of an action under the Convention brought in a court in Australia to enforce a claim in respect of carriage undertaken by that Party, be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of that court.

             (2)  Nothing in this section authorizes the issue of execution against the property of a Party to the Convention.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Evidence of certain matters

             (1)  The Minister may, by notice published in the _Gazette_, from time to time declare:

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Jurisdiction of State courts preserved

                   For the purposes of section 38 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_, an action under the Convention shall be deemed not to be a matter arising directly under a treaty.

## Part III—Carriage to which the Warsaw Convention without the Hague Protocol applies

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Interpretation

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, a reference in the Convention to the territory of a High Contracting Party to the Convention shall be read as a reference to the territories in respect of which a Party declared, in pursuance of section 22, to be a High Contracting Party to the Convention is declared, in pursuance of that section, to be bound by the Convention.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Provisions of Convention to have force of law

             (1)  Any provision of an agreement tending to relieve the carrier of liability in accordance with this Part or to fix a lower limit than the appropriate limit of liability provided by this Part is null and void, but the nullity of such a provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract of carriage.

                     (a)  the insurer indemnifies the carrier against liability as required by Part 205 of the Federal Aviation Regulations of the United States of America made under the law known as Title 49 United States Code—Transportation; and

                   Nothing in this Part affects:

                     (a)  the grounds on which an insurer may cancel a contract of insurance between the insurer and a carrier; or

             (3)  If the carrier does not satisfy the court that it is not engaging, or proposing to engage, in prohibited carriage, the court must grant the injunction.

             (4)  If in the opinion of the court it is desirable to do so, the court may grant an interim injunction pending determination of an application under subsection (2).

             (5)  The court may discharge or vary an injunction or an interim injunction granted under this section.

             (6)  The power of the court to grant an injunction or an interim injunction restraining a carrier from engaging in prohibited carriage may be exercised:

             (7)  A court must not require CASA, as a condition of granting an interim injunction, to give any undertakings as to damages.

                     (a)  a member; or

                     (b)  a member of the staff of CASA.

             (2)  The power of delegation referred to in paragraph (1)(b) includes a power to delegate a power to any member of the staff of CASA from time to time holding, occupying, or performing the duties of, a specified office or position, even if the office or position does not come into existence until after the delegation is given.

# Schedules

# Schedule 1—Convention for the unification of certain rules relating to international carriage by air

_Section 9(1)_

### Chapter I—Scope—Definitions

Article 1 

     1.     This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking. 

     2.     For the purposes of this Convention the expression “international carriage” means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties, or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, if there is an agreed stopping place within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of another Power, even though that Power is not a party to this Convention. A carriage without such an agreed stopping place between territories subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of the same High Contracting Party is not deemed to be international for the purposes of this Convention. 

     3.     Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage, if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of the same High Contracting Party. 

Article 2 

     1.     The Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1\. 

     2.     This Convention does not apply to carriage performed under the terms of any international postal Convention.

### Chapter II—Documents of Carriage

SECTION 1—PASSENGER TICKET

Article 3 

     1.     For the carriage of passengers the carrier must deliver a passenger ticket which shall contain the following particulars: 

     (a)   the place and date of issue; 

     (b)   the place of departure and of destination; 

(c)   the agreed stopping places, provided that the carrier may reserve the right to alter the stopping places in case of necessity, and that if he exercises that right, the alteration shall not have the effect of depriving the carriage of its international character; 

     (d)   the name and address of the carrier or carriers; 

(e)   a statement that the carriage is subject to the rules relating to liability established by this Convention. 

     2.     The absence, irregularity or loss of the passenger ticket does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall none the less be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier accepts a passenger without a passenger ticket having been delivered he shall not be entitled to avail himself of those provisions of this Convention which exclude or limit his liability.

SECTION 2—BAGGAGE CHECK

Article 4 

     1.     For the carriage of baggage, other than small personal objects of which the passenger takes charge himself, the carrier must deliver a baggage check. 

     2.     The baggage check shall be made out in duplicate, one part for the passenger and the other part for the carrier. 

     3.     The baggage check shall contain the following particulars: 

     (a)   the place and date of issue; 

     (b)   the place of departure and of destination; 

     (c)   the name and address of the carrier or carriers; 

     (d)   the number of the passenger ticket; 

(e)   a statement that delivery of the baggage will be made to the bearer of the baggage check; 

(f)   the number and weight of the packages; 

(g)   the amount of the value declared in accordance with Article 22(2); 

(h)   a statement that the carriage is subject to the rules relating to liability established by this Convention. 

     4.     The absence, irregularity or loss of the baggage check does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall none the less be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier accepts baggage without a baggage check having been delivered, or if the baggage check does not contain the particulars set out at (d) (f) and (h) above, the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of those provisions of the Convention which exclude or limit his liability.

Section 3—Air Waybill

Article 5 

     1.     Every carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out and hand over to him a document called an “air waybill”; every consignor has the right to require the carrier to accept this document. 

     2.     The absence, irregularity or loss of this document does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, subject to the provisions of Article 9, be none the less governed by the rules of this Convention. 

Article 6 

     1.     The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original parts and be handed over with the cargo. 

     2.     The first part shall be marked “for the carrier”, and shall be signed by the consignor. The second part shall be marked “for the consignee”; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier and shall accompany the cargo. The third part shall be signed by the carrier and handed by him to the consignor after the cargo has been accepted. 

     3.     The carrier shall sign on acceptance of the cargo. 

     4.     The signature of the carrier may be stamped; that of the consignor may be printed or stamped. 

     5.     If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, he shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf of the consignor.

Article 7 

     The carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate air waybills when there is more than one package.

Article 8 

     The air waybill shall contain the following particulars: 

(a)   the place and date of its execution; 

(b)   the place of departure and of destination; 

(c)   the agreed stopping places, provided that the carrier may reserve the right to alter the stopping places in case of necessity, and that if he exercises that right the alteration shall not have the effect of depriving the carriage of its international character; 

(d)   the name and address of the consignor; 

(e)   the name and address of the first carrier; 

(f)   the name and address of the consignee, if the case so requires; 

(g)   the nature of the cargo; 

(h)   the number of the packages, the method of packing and the particular marks or numbers upon them; 

(i)    the weight, the quantity and the volume or dimensions of the cargo; 

(j)    the apparent condition of the cargo and of the packing; 

(k)   the freight, if it has been agreed upon, the date and place of payment, and the person who is to pay it; 

(l)    if the cargo is sent for payment on delivery, the price of the cargo, and, if the case so requires, the amount of the expenses incurred; 

(m)  the amount of the value declared in accordance with Article 22(2); 

(n)   the number of parts of the air waybill; 

(o)   the documents handed to the carrier to accompany the air waybill; 

(p)   the time fixed for the completion of the carriage and a brief note of the route to be followed, if these matters have been agreed upon; 

(q)   a statement that the carriage is subject to the rules relating to liability established by this Convention. 

Article 9 

     If the carrier accepts cargo without an air waybill having been made out, or if the air waybill does not contain all the particulars set out in Article 8(a) to (i) inclusive and (q), the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this Convention which exclude or limit his liability.

Article 10 

     1.     The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and statements relating to the cargo which he inserts in the air waybill. 

     2.     The consignor will be liable for all damage suffered by the carrier or any other person by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the said particulars and statements.

Article 11 

     1.     The air waybill is _prima facie_ evidence of the conclusion of the contract, of the receipt of the cargo and of the conditions of carriage. 

     2.     The statements in the air waybill relating to the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the number of packages, are prima facie evidence of the facts stated; those relating to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the air waybill to have been, checked by him in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.

Article 12 

     1.     Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the aerodrome of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee named in the air waybill, or by requiring it to be returned to the aerodrome of departure. He must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and he must repay any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right. 

     2.     If it is impossible to carry out the orders of the consignor the carrier must so inform him forthwith. 

     3.     If the carrier obeys the orders of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill delivered to the latter, he will be liable, without prejudice to his right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill. 

     4.     The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13\. Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the air waybill or the cargo, or if he cannot be communicated with, the consignor resumes his right of disposition. 

Article 13 

     1.     Except in the circumstances set out in the preceding Article, the consignee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to require the carrier to hand over to him the air waybill and to deliver the cargo to him, on payment of the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage set out in the air waybill. 

     2.     Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives. 

     3.     If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to put into force against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.

Article 15 

     1.     Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor or the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee. 

     2.     The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express provision in the air waybill.

Article 16 

     1.     The consignor must furnish such information and attach to the air waybill such documents as are necessary to meet the formalities of customs, octroi or police before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of the carrier or his servants or agents. 

     2.     The carrier is under no obligation to inquire into the correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents.

### Chapter III—Liability of the Carrier

Article 17 

     The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.

Article 18 

     1.     The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or of damage to, any registered baggage or any cargo, if the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air.

     3.     The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by river performed outside an aerodrome. If, however, such a carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or trans-shipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air. 

Article 19 

     The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. 

Article 20 

     1.     The carrier is not liable if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him or them to take such measures. 

     2.     In the carriage of cargo and baggage the carrier is not liable if he proves that the damage was occasioned by negligent pilotage or negligence in the handling of the aircraft or in navigation and that, in all other respects, he and his agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage.

     If the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the injured person the Court may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability.

Article 22 

     1.     In the carriage of passengers the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to the sum of 125,000 francs. Where, in accordance with the law of the Court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of periodical payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments shall not exceed 125,000 francs. Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability. 

     2.     In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 250 francs per kilogram, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of the value at delivery and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the actual value to the consignor at delivery. 

     3.     As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of the carrier is limited to 5,000 francs per passenger. 

     4.     The sums mentioned above shall be deemed to refer to the French franc consisting of 65½ milligrams gold of millesimal fineness 900\. These sums may be converted into any national currency in round figures.

Article 23 

     Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.

Article 24 

     1.     In the cases covered by Articles 18 and 19 any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention. 

     2.     In the cases covered by Article 17 the provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply, without prejudice to the questions as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. 

Article 25 

     1.     The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this Convention which exclude or limit his liability, if the damage is caused by his wilful misconduct or by such default on his part as, in accordance with the law of the Court seised of the case, is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct. 

     2.     Similarly the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the said provisions, if the damage is caused as aforesaid by any servant or agent of the carrier acting within the scope of his employment. 

Article 26 

     1.     Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of baggage or cargo without complaint is prima facie evidence that the same has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the document of carriage. 

     2.     In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within three days from the date of receipt in the case of baggage and seven days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo. In the case of delay the complaint must be made at the latest within fourteen days from the date on which the baggage or cargo has been placed at his disposal. 

     3.     Every complaint must be made in writing upon the document of carriage or by separate notice in writing despatched within the times aforesaid. 

     4.     Failing complaint within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on his part. 

Article 27 

     In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his estate. 

Article 28 

     1.     An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the Court having jurisdiction where the carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or has an establishment by which the contract has been made or before the Court having jurisdiction at the place of destination. 

     2.     Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the Court seised of the case. 

Article 29 

     1.     The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped. 

     2.     The method of calculating the period of limitation shall be determined by the law of the Court seised of the case. 

Article 30 

     1.     In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive carriers and falling within the definition set out in the third paragraph of Article 1, each carrier who accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subjected to the rules set out in this Convention, and is deemed to be one of the contracting parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is performed under his supervision. 

     2.     In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his representative can take action only against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey. 

     3.     As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, or damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.

### Chapter IV—Provisions Relating to Combined Carriage

Article 31 

     1.     In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this Convention apply only to the carriage by air, provided that the carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1\.

### Chapter V—General and Final Provisions

Article 32 

     Any clause contained in the contract and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void. Nevertheless for the carriage of cargo arbitration clauses are allowed, subject to this Convention, if the arbitration is to take place within one of the jurisdictions referred to in the first paragraph of Article 28\. 

Article 33 

     Nothing contained in this Convention shall prevent the carrier either from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage, or from making regulations which do not conflict with the provisions of this Convention. 

Article 34 

     This Convention does not apply to international carriage by air performed by way of experimental trial by air navigation undertakings with the view to the establishment of a regular line of air navigation, nor does it apply to carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances outside the normal scope of an air carrier’s business.

Article 35 

     The expression “days” when used in this Convention means current days not working days.

# Schedule 2—The Warsaw Convention as amended at the Hague

_Section 8_

_Article XIX of the Hague Protocol provides that, as between the_ parties _to the Protocol, the Warsaw Convention and the Protocol are to be read and interpreted together as one single instrument, to be known as the “Warsaw Convention as amended at The Hague, 1955”._

_The text in this Schedule contains:_ 

_(a)   the operative provisions of the__Warsaw__Convention as modified by Chapter I of the Hague Protocol; and_

_(b)   the remaining provisions of the Protocol._

_OPERATIVE PROVISIONS OF THE__WARSAW__CONVENTION, AS MODIFIED BY__THE   HAGUE__PROTOCOL_

**Chapter I—Scope—Definitions**

Article 1

1.  This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking. 

2.  For the purposes of this Convention, the expression _international carriage_ means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention. 

3.  Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State. 

Article 2 

1.  The Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1\. 

2.  This Convention shall not apply to carriage of mail and postal packages.

### Chapter II—Documents of Carriage

Section 1—Passenger Ticket 

Article 3 

1.  In respect of the carriage of passengers a ticket shall be delivered containing: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; 

     (c)   a notice to the effect that, if the passenger’s journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage to baggage.

2.  The passenger ticket shall constitute _prima facie_ evidence of the conclusion and conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the passenger ticket does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if, with the consent of the carrier, the passenger embarks without a passenger ticket having been delivered, or if the ticket does not include the notice required by paragraph 1(c) of this Article, the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22\. 

Section 2—Baggage Check 

Article 4 

1.  In respect of the carriage of registered baggage, a baggage check shall be delivered, which, unless combined with or incorporated in a passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 1, shall contain: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the Territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; 

     (c)   a notice to the effect that, if the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss of or damage to baggage. 

2.  The baggage check shall constitute _prima facie_ evidence of the registration of the baggage and of the conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the baggage check does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier takes charge of the baggage without a baggage check having been delivered or if the baggage check (unless combined with or incorporated in the passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 1(c)) does not include the notice required by paragraph 1(c) of this Article, he shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22, paragraph 2.

Section 3—Air Waybill 

Article 5 

1.  Every carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out and hand over to him a document called an “air waybill”; every consignor has the right to require the carrier to accept this document. 

2.  The absence, irregularity or loss of this document does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, subject to the provisions of Article 9, be none the less governed by the rules of this Convention. 

Article 6 

1.  The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original parts and be handed over with the cargo. 

2.  The first part shall be marked “for the carrier”, and shall be signed by the consignor. The second part shall be marked “for the consignee”; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier and shall accompany the cargo. The third part shall be signed by the carrier and handed by him to the consignor after the cargo has been accepted. 

3.  The carrier shall sign prior to the loading of the cargo on board the aircraft. 

4.  The signature of the carrier may be stamped; that of the consignor may be printed or stamped. 

5.  If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, he shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf of the consignor.

Article 7 

The carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate air waybills when there is more than one package. 

Article 8 

The air waybill shall contain: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; 

     (c)   a notice to the consignor to the effect that, if the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss of or damage to cargo. 

Article 9 

If, with the consent of the carrier, cargo is loaded on board the aircraft without an air waybill having been made out, or if the air waybill does not include the notice required by Article 8, paragraph (c), the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22, paragraph 2\. 

Article 10 

1.  The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and statements relating to the cargo which he inserts in the air waybill. 

2.  The consignor shall indemnify the carrier against all damage suffered by him, or by any other person to whom the carrier is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements furnished by the consignor. 

Article 11 

1.  The air waybill is prima facie evidence of the conclusion of the contract, of the receipt of the cargo and of the conditions of carriage. 

2.  The statements in the air waybill relating to the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the number of packages, are prima facie evidence of the facts stated; those relating to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the air waybill to have been, checked by him in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo. 

Article 12 

1.  Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the aerodrome of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee named in the air waybill, or by requiring it to be returned to the aerodrome of departure. He must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and he must repay any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right. 

2.  If it is impossible to carry out the orders of the consignor the carrier must so inform him forthwith. 

3.  If the carrier obeys the orders of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill delivered to the latter, he will be liable, without prejudice to his right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill. 

4.  The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13\. Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the air waybill or the cargo, or if he cannot be communicated with, the consignor resumes his right of disposition.

Article 13 

1.  Except in the circumstances set out in the preceding Article, the consignee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to require the carrier to hand over to him the air waybill and to deliver the cargo to him, on payment of the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage set out in the air waybill. 

2.  Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives. 

3.  If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to put into force against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage. 

Article 14 

The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given them by Articles 12 and 13, each in his own name, whether he is acting in his own interest or in the interest of another, provided that he carries out the obligations imposed by the contract. 

Article 15 

1.  Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor or the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee. 

2.  The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express provision in the air waybill. 

3.  Nothing in this Convention prevents the issue of a negotiable air waybill. 

Article 16 

1.  The consignor must furnish such information and attach to the air waybill such documents as are necessary to meet the formalities of customs, octroi or police before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of the carrier or his servants or agents. 

2.  The carrier is under no obligation to inquire into the correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents.

### Chapter III—Liability of the Carrier

Article 17 

The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking. 

Article 18 

1.  The carrier is liable for damages sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or of damage to, any registered baggage or any cargo, if the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air. 

2.  The carriage by air within the meaning of the preceding paragraph comprises the period during which the baggage or cargo is in charge of the carrier, whether in an aerodrome or on board an aircraft, or, in the case of a landing outside an aerodrome, in any place whatsoever. 

3.  The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by river performed outside an aerodrome. If, however, such a carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or trans-shipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air.

Article 19 

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. 

Article 20 

The carrier is not liable if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him or them to take such measures. 

Article 21 

If the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the injured person the Court may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability. 

Article 22 

1.  In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Where, in accordance with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of periodical payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments shall not exceed two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability. 

2.  (a)   In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of two hundred and fifty francs per kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that the sum is greater than the passenger’s or consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination. 

     (b)   In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the registered baggage or cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability. 

3.  As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of the carrier is limited to five thousand francs per passenger. 

4.  The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later. 

5.  The sums mentioned in francs in this Article shall be deemed to refer to a currency unit consisting of sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into national currencies in round figures. Conversion of the sums into national currencies other than gold shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the gold value of such currencies at the date of the judgment. 

Article 23 

1.  Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention. 

2.  Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried.

Article 24 

1.  In the cases covered by Articles 18 and 19 any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention. 

2.  In the cases covered by Article 17 the provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply, without prejudice to the questions as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. 

Article 25 

The limits of liability specified in Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that he was acting within the scope of his employment. 

Article 25A 

1.  If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which this Convention relates, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which that carrier himself is entitled to invoke under Article 22\. 

2.  The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, his servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits. 

3.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result. 

Article 26

2.  In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of baggage and fourteen days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo. In the case of delay the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his disposal. 

3.  Every complaint must be made in writing upon the document of carriage or by separate notice in writing despatched within the times aforesaid. 

4.  Failing complaint within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on his part.

Article 28 

1.  An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the Court having jurisdiction where the carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or has an establishment by which the contract has been made or before the Court having jurisdiction at the place of destination. 

2.  Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the Court seised of the case.

Article 29 

1.  The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped. 

2.  The method of calculating the period of limitation shall be determined by the law of the Court seised of the case. 

Article 30 

1.  In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive carriers and falling within the definition set out in the third paragraph of Article 1, each carrier who accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subjected to the rules set out in this Convention, and is deemed to be one of the contracting parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is performed under his supervision. 

2.  In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his representative can take action only against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey. 

3.  As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, or damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.

### Chapter IV—Provisions Relating to Combined Carriage

# Schedule 3—Convention

_Section 9(2A)_

CONVENTION,

Supplementary to the Warsaw Convention, for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air Performed by a Person Other than the Contracting Carrier. 

THE STATES SIGNATORY TO THE PRESENT CONVENTION 

     NOTING that the Warsaw Convention does not contain particular rules relating to international carriage by air performed by a person who is not a party to the agreement for carriage 

     CONSIDERING that it is therefore desirable to formulate rules to apply in such circumstances 

     HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: 

Article I 

     In this Convention: 

     _a_)    “Warsaw Convention” means the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed at Warsaw on 12 October 1929, or the Warsaw Convention as amended at The Hague, 1955, according to whether the carriage under the agreement referred to in paragraph (b) is governed by the one or by the other; 

     _b_)    “contracting carrier” means a person who as a principal makes an agreement for carriage governed by the Warsaw Convention with a passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the passenger or consignor; 

     _c_)    “actual carrier” means a person, other than the contracting carrier, who, by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier, performs the whole or part of the carriage contemplated in paragraph (b) but who is not with respect to such part a successive carrier within the meaning of the Warsaw Convention. Such authority is presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary. 

Article II 

     If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the agreement referred to in Article I, paragraph (b), is governed by the Warsaw Convention, both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise provided in this Convention, be subject to the rules of the Warsaw Convention, the former for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the agreement, the latter solely for the carriage which he performs. 

Article III 

     1.     The acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the contracting carrier. 

     2.     The acts and omissions of the contracting carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the actual carrier. Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual carrier to liability exceeding the limits specified in Article 22 of the Warsaw Convention. Any special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes obligations not imposed by the Warsaw Convention or any waiver of rights conferred by that Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery at destination contemplated in Article 22 of the said Convention, shall not affect the actual carrier unless agreed to by him. 

Article IV 

     Any complaint to be made or order to be given under the Warsaw Convention to the carrier shall have the same effect whether addressed to the contracting carrier or to the actual carrier. Nevertheless, orders referred to in Article 12 of the Warsaw Convention shall only be effective if addressed to the contracting carrier.

Article V 

     In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent of that carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which are applicable under this Convention to the carrier whose servant or agent he is unless it is proved that he acted in a manner which, under the Warsaw Convention, prevents the limits of liability from being invoked. 

Article VI 

     In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment, shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the contracting carrier or the actual carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to him. 

Article VII 

     In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or against both together or separately. If the action is brought against only one of those carriers, that carrier shall have the right to require the other carrier to be joined in the proceedings, the procedure and effects being governed by the law of the court seised of the case. 

Article VIII 

     Any action for damages contemplated in Article VII of this Convention must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, either before a court in which an action may be brought against the contracting carrier, as provided in Article 28 of the Warsaw Convention, or before the court having jurisdiction at the place where the actual carrier is ordinarily resident or has his principal place of business. 

Article IX 

     1.     Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the actual carrier of liability under this Convention or to fix a lower limit than that which is applicable according to this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole agreement, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention. 

     2.     In respect of the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the preceding paragraph shall not apply to contractual provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried. 

     3.     Any clause contained in an agreement for carriage and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void. Nevertheless, for the carriage of cargo arbitration clauses are allowed, subject to this Convention, if the arbitration is to take place in one of the jurisdictions referred to in Article VIII. 

Article X 

     Except as provided in Article VII, nothing in this Convention shall affect the rights and obligations of the two carriers between themselves. 

Article XI 

     Until the date on which this Convention comes into force in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII, it shall remain open for signature on behalf of any State which at that date is a Member of the United Nations or of any of the Specialized Agencies. 

Article XII 

     1.     This Convention shall be subject to ratification by the signatory States. 

     2.     The instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Government of the United States of Mexico.

Article XIII 

     1.     As soon as five of the signatory States have deposited their instruments of ratification of this Convention, it shall come into force between them on the ninetieth day after the date of the deposit of the fifth instrument of ratification. It shall come into force for each State ratifying thereafter on the ninetieth day after the deposit of its instrument of ratification. 

     2.     As soon as this Convention comes into force, it shall be registered with the United Nations and the International Civil Aviation Organization by the Government of the United States of Mexico. 

Article XIV 

     1.     This Convention shall, after it has come into force, be open for accession by any State Member of the United Nations or of any of the Specialized Agencies. 

     2.     The accession of a State shall be effected by the deposit of an instrument of accession with the Government of the United States of Mexico and shall take effect as from the ninetieth day after the date of such deposit. 

Article XV 

     1.     Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention by notification addressed to the Government of the United States of Mexico. 

     2.     Denunciation shall take effect six months after the date of receipt by the Government of the United States of Mexico of the notification of denunciation. 

Article XVI 

     1.     Any Contracting State may at the time of its ratification of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter declare by notification to the Government of the United States of Mexico that the Convention shall extend to any of the territories for whose international relations it is responsible. 

     2.     The Convention shall, ninety days after the date of the receipt of such notification by the Government of the United States of Mexico, extend to the territories named therein. 

     3.     Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention, in accordance with the provisions of Article XV, separately for any or all of the territories for the international relations of which such State is responsible. 

Article XVII 

     No reservation may be made to this Convention. 

Article XVIII 

     The Government of the United States of Mexico shall give notice to the International Civil Aviation Organization and to all States Members of the United Nations or of any of the Specialized Agencies: 

     _a_)    of any signature of this Convention and the date thereof; 

     _b_)    of the deposit of any instrument of ratification or accession and the date thereof; 

     _c_)    of the date on which this Convention comes into force in accordance with Article XIII, paragraph 1; 

     _d_)    of the receipt of any notification of denunciation and the date thereof; 

     _e_)    of the receipt of any declaration or notification made under Article XVI and the date thereof. 

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, having been duly authorized, have signed this Convention.

     DONE at Guadalajara on the eighteenth day of September One Thousand Nine Hundred and Sixty-one in three authentic texts drawn up in the English, French and Spanish languages. In case of any inconsistency, the text in the French language, in which language the Warsaw Convention of 12 October 1929 was drawn up, shall prevail. The Government of the United States of Mexico will establish an official translation of the text of the Convention in the Russian language. 

     This Convention shall be deposited with the Government of the United States of Mexico with which, in accordance with Article XI, it shall remain open for signature, and that Government shall send certified copies thereof to the International Civil Aviation Organization and to all States Members of the United Nations or of any Specialized Agency.

(“WARSAW CONVENTION AS AMENDED AT THE HAGUE, 1955, AT GUATEMALA   CITY, 1971, AND BY THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL NO. 3 OF MONTREAL, 1975”)

_Article V of the Montreal Protocol No. 3, Article XVII of the Guatemala City Protocol and Article XIX of the Hague Protocol together provide that, as between parties to the Montreal Protocol No. 3, that Protocol, the Guatemala City Protocol, the Hague Protocol and the Warsaw Convention are to be read and interpreted together as one single instrument._

_The text in this Schedule contains:_

_(a)   the operative provisions of the Warsaw Convention as modified by Chapter I of the Hague Protocol, Chapter I of the Guatemala City Protocol and Chapter I of the Montreal Protocol No. 3; and_

_(b)   the remaining provisions of the Hague Protocol, the__Guatemala   City__Protocol and the__Montreal__Protocol No. 3._

_OPERATIVE PROVISIONS OF THE__WARSAW__CONVENTION, AS MODIFIED BY__THE   HAGUE__,__GUATEMALA__CITY AND__MONTREAL__NO. 3 PROTOCOLS_

### Chapter I—Scope—Definitions

Article 1 

1.  This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking. 

2.  For the purposes of this Convention, the expression _international carriage_ means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention. 

3.  Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.

Article 2 

1.  The Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1\. 

2.  This Convention shall not apply to carriage of mail and postal packages. 

### Chapter II—Documents of Carriage

Section 1—Passenger Ticket 

Article 3 

1.  In respect of the carriage of passengers an individual or collective document of carriage shall be delivered containing: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place. 

2.  Any other means which would preserve a record of the information indicated in a) and b) of the foregoing paragraph may be substituted for the delivery of the document referred to in that paragraph. 

3.  Non-compliance with the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability. 

Section 2—Baggage Check 

Article 4 

1.  In respect of the carriage of checked baggage, a baggage check shall be delivered, which, unless combined with or incorporated in a document of carriage which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 1, shall contain: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place. 

2.  Any other means which would preserve a record of the information indicated in a) and b) of the foregoing paragraph may be substituted for the delivery of the baggage check referred to in that paragraph. 

3.  Non-compliance with the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability. 

Section 3—Air Waybill 

Article 5 

1.  Every carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out and hand over to him a document called an “air waybill”; every consignor has the right to require the carrier to accept this document. 

2.  The absence, irregularity or loss of this document does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, subject to the provisions of Article 9, be none the less governed by the rules of this Convention.

Article 6 

1.  The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original parts and be handed over with the cargo. 

2.  The first part shall be marked “for the carrier”, and shall be signed by the consignor. The second part shall be marked “for the consignee”; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier and shall accompany the cargo. The third part shall be signed by the carrier and handed by him to the consignor after the cargo has been accepted. 

3.  The carrier shall sign prior to the loading of the cargo on board the aircraft. 

4.  The signature of the carrier may be stamped; that of the consignor may be printed or stamped. 

5.  If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, he shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf of the consignor. 

Article 7 

The carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate air waybills when there is more than one package. 

Article 8 

The air waybill shall contain: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the Territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; 

     (c)   a notice to the consignor to the effect that, if the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss of or damage to cargo. 

Article 9 

If, with the consent of the carrier, cargo is loaded on board the aircraft without an air waybill having been made out, or if the air waybill does not include the notice required by Article 8, paragraph (c), the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22, paragraph 2\. 

Article 10 

1.  The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and statements relating to the cargo which he inserts in the air waybill. 

2.  The consignor shall indemnify the carrier against all damage suffered by him, or by any other person to whom the carrier is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements furnished by the consignor. 

Article 11 

1.  The air waybill is _prima facie_ evidence of the conclusion of the contract, of the receipt of the cargo and of the conditions of carriage. 

2.  The statements in the air waybill relating to the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the number of packages, are prima facie evidence of the facts stated; those relating to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the air waybill to have been, checked by him in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.

Article 12 

1.  Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the aerodrome of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee named in the air waybill, or by requiring it to be returned to the aerodrome of departure. He must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and he must repay any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right. 

2.  If it is impossible to carry out the orders of the consignor the carrier must so inform him forthwith. 

3.  If the carrier obeys the orders of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill delivered to the latter, he will be liable, without prejudice to his right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill. 

4.  The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13\. Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the air waybill or the cargo, or if he cannot be communicated with, the consignor resumes his right of disposition. 

Article 13 

1.  Except in the circumstances set out in the preceding Article, the consignee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to require the carrier to hand over to him the air waybill and to deliver the cargo to him, on payment of the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage set out in the air waybill. 

2.  Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives. 

3.  If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to put into force against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage. 

Article 14 

The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given them by Articles 12 and 13, each in his own name, whether he is acting in his own interest or in the interest of another, provided that he carries out the obligations imposed by the contract. 

Article 15 

1.  Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor or the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee. 

2.  The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express provision in the air waybill. 

3.  Nothing in this Convention prevents the issue of a negotiable air waybill. 

Article 16 

1.  The consignor must furnish such information and attach to the air waybill such documents as are necessary to meet the formalities of customs, octroi or police before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of the carrier or his servants or agents. 

2.  The carrier is under no obligation to inquire into the correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents.

### Chapter III—Liability of the Carrier

Article 17 

1.  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of death or personal injury of a passenger upon condition only that the event which caused the death or injury took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking. However, the carrier is not liable if the death or injury resulted solely from the state of health of the passenger. 

2.  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of destruction or loss of, or of damage to, baggage upon condition only that the event which caused the destruction, loss or damage took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking or during any period within which the baggage was in charge of the carrier. However, the carrier is not liable if the damage resulted solely from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage. 

3.  Unless otherwise specified, in this Convention the term “baggage” means both checked baggage and objects carried by the passenger. 

Article 18 

1.  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or of damage to, any cargo, if the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air. 

2.  The carriage by air within the meaning of the preceding paragraph comprises the period during which the cargo is in charge of the carrier, whether in an airport or on board an aircraft, or, in the case of a landing outside an airport, in any place whatsoever. 

3.  The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by river performed outside an aerodrome. If, however, such a carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or trans-shipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air. 

Article 19 

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. 

Article 20 

1.  In the carriage of passengers and baggage the carrier shall not be liable for damage occasioned by delay if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for them to take such measures. 

2.  In the carriage of cargo the carrier shall not be liable for damage resulting from destruction, loss, damage or delay if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for them to take such measures. 

Article 21 

If the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from his liability to such person to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage. When by reason of the death or injury of a passenger compensation is claimed by a person other than the passenger, the carrier shall likewise be wholly or partly exonerated from his liability to the extent that he proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of that passenger.

Article 22 

1.  a)    In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier is limited to the sum of 100 000 Special Drawing Rights for the aggregate of the claims, however founded, in respect of damage suffered as a result of the death or personal injury of each passenger. Where, in accordance with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of periodic payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments shall not exceed 100 000 Special Drawing Rights. 

     b)    In the case of delay in the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to 4 150 Special Drawing Rights. 

     c)    In the carriage of baggage the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to 1 000 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger. 

2.  a)    In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that the sum is greater than the consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination. 

     b)    In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of the cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability. 

3.  a)    The courts of the High Contracting Parties which are not authorized under their law to award the costs of the action, including lawyers’ fees, shall, in actions to which this Convention applies, have the power to award, in their discretion, to the claimant the whole or part of the costs of the action, including lawyers’ fees which the court considers reasonable. 

     b)    The costs of the action including lawyers’ fees shall be awarded in accordance with subparagraph a) only if the claimant gives a written notice to the carrier of the amount claimed including the particulars of the calculation of that amount and the carrier does not make, within a period of six months after his receipt of such notice, a written offer of settlement in an amount at least equal to the compensation awarded within the applicable limit. This period will be extended until the time of commencement of the action if that is later. 

     c)    The costs of the action including lawyers’ fees shall not be taken into account in applying the limits under this Article. 

4.  The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Article and Article 42 shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgment. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgment, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that High Contracting Party.

     Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International Monetary Fund and whose Law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 a) of Article 22 may, at the time of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier in judicial proceedings in their territories is fixed at a sum of 1 500 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 a) of Article 22; 62 500 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 b) of Article 22; 15 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 c) of Article 22; and 250 monetary units per kilogramme with respect to paragraph 2 a) of Article 22\. A State applying the provisions of this paragraph may also declare that the sum referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 42 shall be the sum of 187 500 monetary units. This monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned. 

Article 23 

1.  Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention. 

2.  Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried. 

Article 24 

1.  In the carriage of cargo, any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention. 

2.  In the carriage of passengers and baggage any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits of liability set out in this Convention, without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. Such limits of liability constitute maximum limits and may not be exceeded whatever the circumstances which gave rise to the liability. 

Article 25 

The limit of liability specified in paragraph 2 of Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that he was acting within the scope of his employment. 

Article 25A 

1.  If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which the Convention relates, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which that carrier himself is entitled to invoke under this Convention. 

2.  The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, his servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits. 

3.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply to the carriage of cargo if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

Article 26 

1.  Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of baggage or cargo without complaint is _prima facie_ evidence that the same has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the document of carriage. 

2.  In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of baggage and fourteen days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo. In the case of delay the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his disposal. 

3.  Every complaint must be made in writing upon the document of carriage or by separate notice in writing despatched within the times aforesaid. 

4.  Failing complaint within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on his part. 

_Article 27_

In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his estate. 

_Article 28_

1.  An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the Court having jurisdiction where the carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or has an establishment by which the contract has been made or before the Court having jurisdiction at the place of destination. 

2.  In respect of damage resulting from the death, injury or delay of a passenger or the destruction, loss, damage or delay of baggage, the action may be brought before one of the Courts mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, or in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, before the Court within the jurisdiction of which the carrier has an establishment if the passenger has his domicile or permanent residence in the territory of the same High Contracting Party. 

3.  Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the Court seised of the case. 

_Article 29_

1.  The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped. 

2.  The method of calculating the period of limitation shall be determined by the law of the Court seised of the case. 

_Article 30_

1.  In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive carriers and falling within the definition set out in the third paragraph of Article 1, each carrier who accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subjected to the rules set out in this Convention, and is deemed to be one of the contracting parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is performed under his supervision. 

2.  In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his representative can take action only against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey. 

3.  As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, or damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.

_Article 30A_

Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.

### Chapter IV—Provisions Relating to Combined Carriage

Article 31 

1.  In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this Convention apply only to the carriage by air, provided that the carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1\. 

2.  Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the parties in the case of combined carriage from inserting in the document of air carriage conditions relating to other modes of carriage, provided that the provisions of this Convention are observed as regards the carriage by air.

### Chapter V—General and Final Provisions

Article 32 

Any clause contained in the contract and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void. Nevertheless for the carriage of cargo arbitration clauses are allowed, subject to this Convention, if the arbitration is to take place within one of the jurisdictions referred to in the first paragraph of Article 28\. 

Article 33 

Nothing contained in this Convention shall prevent the carrier either from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage, or from making regulations which do not conflict with the provisions of this Convention.

The provisions of Articles 3 to 9 inclusive relating to documents of carriage shall not apply in the case of carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances outside the normal scope of an air carrier’s business. 

_Article 35_

_Article 35A_

Such a system shall fulfil the following conditions: 

     (a)   it shall not in any circumstances impose upon the carrier, his servants or agents, any liability in addition to that provided under this Convention; 

     (b)   it shall not impose upon the carrier any financial or administrative burden other than collecting in that State contributions from passengers if required so to do; 

     (c)   it shall not give rise to any discrimination between carriers with regard to the passengers concerned and the benefits available to the said passengers under the system shall be extended to them regardless of the carrier whose services they have used; 

     (d)   if a passenger has contributed to the system, any person suffering damage as a consequence of death or personal injury of such passenger shall be entitled to the benefits of the system.

Article 36

2.  For the purposes of the Convention the word _territory_ means not only the metropolitan territory of a State but also all other territories for the foreign relations of which that State is responsible. 

Article 41 

Any High Contracting Party shall be entitled not earlier than two years after the coming into force of this Convention to call for the assembling of a new international Conference in order to consider any improvements which may be made in this Convention. To this end he will communicate with the Government of the French Republic which will take the necessary measures to make preparations for such Conference. 

Article 42 

1.  Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 41, Conferences of the Parties to the Protocol done at Guatemala City on the eighth March 1971 shall be convened during the fifth and tenth years respectively after the date of entry into force of the said Protocol for the purpose of reviewing the limit established in Article 22, paragraph 1a) of the Convention as amended by that Protocol.

3.  Subject to paragraph 2 of this Article, unless before the thirty-first December of the fifth and tenth year after the date of entry into force of the Protocol referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article the aforesaid Conferences decide otherwise by a two-thirds majority vote of the Parties present and voting, the limit of liability in Article 22, paragraph 1a) in force at the respective dates of these Conferences shall on those dates be increased by 12 500 Special Drawing Rights. 

4.  The applicable limit shall be that which, in accordance with the preceding paragraphs, is in effect on the date of the event which caused the death or personal injury of the passenger.

The High Contracting Parties reserve to themselves the right to declare at the time of ratification or of accession that the first paragraph of Article 2 of this Convention shall not apply to international carriage by air performed directly by the State, its colonies, protectorates or mandated territories or by any other territory under its sovereignty, suzerainty or authority.

_OPERATIVE PROVISIONS OF THE__WARSAW__CONVENTION, AS MODIFIED BY__THE   HAGUE__AND__MONTREAL__NO. 4 PROTOCOLS_

### Chapter I—Scope—Definitions

Article 1 

1.  This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking. 

2.  For the purposes of this Convention, the expression _international carriage_ means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purpose of this Convention. 

3.  Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.

Article 2 

1.  The Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1\. 

2.  In the carriage of postal items the carrier shall be liable only to the relevant postal administration in accordance with the rules applicable to the relationship between the carriers and the postal administrations. 

3.  Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this Convention shall not apply to the carriage of postal items. 

### Chapter II—Documents of Carriage

SECTION 1—PASSENGER TICKET 

Article 3 

1.  In respect of the carriage of passengers a ticket shall be delivered containing: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the Territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; 

     (c)   a notice to the effect that, if the passenger’s journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage to baggage. 

2.  The passenger ticket shall constitute _prima facie_ evidence of the conclusion and conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the passenger ticket does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if, with the consent of the carrier, the passenger embarks without a passenger ticket having been delivered, or if the ticket does not include the notice required by paragraph 1 (c) of this Article, the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22\. 

SECTION 2—BAGGAGE CHECK 

Article 4 

1.  In respect of the carriage of registered baggage, a baggage check shall be delivered, which, unless combined with or incorporated in a passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 1, shall contain: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the Territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; 

     (c)   a notice to the effect that; if the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss of or damage to baggage. 

2.  The baggage check shall constitute _prima facie_ evidence of the registration of the baggage and of the conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the baggage check does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier takes charge of the baggage without a baggage check having been delivered or if the baggage check (unless combined with or incorporated in the passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 1 (c)) does not include the notice required by paragraph 1 (c) of this Article, he shall not be entitled to avail himslf of the provisions of Article 22, paragraph 2.

SECTION 3—DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO CARGO 

Article 5 

1.  In respect of the carriage of cargo an air waybill shall be delivered. 

2.  Any other means which would preserve a record of the carriage to be performed may, with the consent of the consignor, be substituted for the delivery of an air waybill. If such other means are used, the carrier shall, if so requested by the consignor, deliver to the consignor a receipt for the cargo permitting identification of the consignment and access to the information contained in the record preserved by such other means. 

3.  The impossibility of using, at points of transit and destination, the other means which would preserve the record of the carriage referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article does not entitle the carrier to refuse to accept the cargo for carriage. 

Article 6 

1.  The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original parts. 

2.  The first part shall be marked “for the carrier”; it shall be signed by the consignor. The second part shall be marked “for the consignee”; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier. The third part shall be signed by the carrier and handed by him to the consignor after the cargo has been accepted. 

3.  The signature of the carrier and that of the consignor may be printed or stamped. 

4.  If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, he shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf of the consignor. 

Article 7 

When there is more than one package: 

     (a)   the carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate air waybills; 

     (b)   the consignor has the right to require the carrier to deliver separate receipts when the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 5 are used. 

Article 8 

The air waybill and the receipt for the cargo shall contain: 

     (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; 

     (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the Territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; and 

     (c)   an indication of the weight of the consignment. 

Article 9 

Non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 5 to 8 shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability. 

Article 10 

1.  The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and statements relating to the cargo inserted by him or on his behalf in the air waybill or furnished by him or on his behalf to the carrier for insertion in the receipt for the cargo or for insertion in the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 5.

2.  The consignor shall indemnify the carrier against all damage suffered by him, or by any other person to whom the carrier is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements furnished by the consignor or on his behalf. 

3.  Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the carrier shall indemnify the consignor against all damage suffered by him, or by any other person to whom the consignor is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements inserted by the carrier or on his behalf in the receipt for the cargo or in the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 5\. 

Article 11 

1.  The air waybill or the receipt for the cargo is _prima facie_ evidence of the conclusion of the contract, of the acceptance of the cargo and of the conditions of carriage mentioned therein. 

2.  Any statements in the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo relating to the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the number of packages, are _prima facie_ evidence of the facts stated; those relating to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the air waybill to have been, checked by him in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo. 

Article 12 

1.  Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the airport of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee orginally designated, or by requiring it to be returned to the airport of departure. He must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and he must repay any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right. 

2.  If it is impossible to carry out the orders of the consignor the carrier must so inform him forthwith. 

3.  If the carrier obeys the orders of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo delivered to the latter, he will be liable, without prejudice to his right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo. 

4.  The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13\. Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the cargo, or if he cannot be communicated with, the consignor resumes his right of disposition. 

Article 13 

1.  Except when the consignor has exercised his right under Article 12, the consignee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to require the carrier to deliver the cargo to him, on payment of the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage. 

2.  Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives. 

3.  If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage. 

Article 14 

The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given them by Articles 12 and 13, each in his own name, whether he is acting in his own interest or in the interest of another, provided that he carries out the obligations imposed by the contract of carriage.

Article 15 

1.  Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor and the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee. 

2.  The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express provision in the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo. 

Article 16 

1.  The consignor must furnish such information and such documents as are necessary to meet the formalities of customs, octroi or police before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of the carrier, his servants or agents. 

2.  The carrier is under no obligation to inquire into the correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents. 

### Chapter III—Liability of the Carrier

Article 17 

The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking. 

Article 18 

1.  The carrier is liable for damages sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, any registered baggage, if the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air. 

2.  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air. 

3.  However, the carrier is not liable if he proves that the destruction, loss of, or damage to, the cargo resulted solely from one or more of the following: 

     a)    inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo; 

     b)    defective packing of that cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or his servants or agents; 

     c)    an act of war or an armed conflict; 

     d)    an act of public authority carried out in connexion with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo. 

4.  The carriage by air within the meaning of the preceding paragraphs of this Article comprises the period during which the baggage or cargo is in the charge of the carrier, whether in an airport or on board an aircraft, or, in the case of a landing outside an airport, in any place whatsoever. 

5.  The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by river performed outside an airport. If, however, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air.

Article 19 

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. 

Article 20 

In the carriage of passengers and baggage, and in the case of damage occasioned by delay in the carriage of cargo, the carrier shall not be liable if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for them to take such measures. 

Article 21 

1.  In the carriage of passengers and baggage, if the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the person suffering the damage the Court may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability. 

2.  In the carriage of cargo, if the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he derives his rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from his liability to the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage. 

Article 22 

1.  In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Where, in accordance with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of periodical payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments shall not exceed two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability. 

2.  (a)   In the carriage of registered baggage, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of two hundred and fifty francs per kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that the sum is greater than the passenger’s or consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination. 

     (b)   In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that the sum is greater than the consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination. 

     (c)   In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the registered baggage or cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability. 

3.  As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of the carrier is limited to five thousand francs per passenger. 

4.  The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.

5.  The sums mentioned in francs in this Article shall be deemed to refer to a currency unit consisting of sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into national currencies in round figures. Conversion of the sums into national currencies other than gold shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the gold value of such currencies at the date of the judgment. 

6.  The sums mentioned in terms of the Special Drawing Right in this Article shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgment. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgment, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that High Contracting Party. 

Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 2 (b) of Article 22 may, at the time of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier in judicial proceedings in their territories is fixed at a sum of two hundred and fifty monetary units per kilogramme. The monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. This sum may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The conversion of this sum into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned. 

Article 23 

1.  Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention. 

2.  Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried. 

Article 24 

1.  In the carriage of passengers and baggage, any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention, without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. 

2.  In the carriage of cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits of liability set out in this Convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. Such limits of liability constitute maximum limits and may not be exceeded whatever the circumstances which gave rise to the liability. 

Article 25 

In the carriage of passengers and baggage, the limits of liability specified in Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that he was acting within the scope of his employment. 

Article 25A 

1.  If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which this Convention relates, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which that carrier himself is entitled to invoke under Article 22.

2.  The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, his servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits. 

3.  In the carriage of passengers and baggage, the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result. 

Article 26 

1.  Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of baggage or cargo without complaint is _prima facie_ evidence that the same has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the document of carriage. 

2.  In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of baggage and fourteen days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo. In the case of delay the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his disposal. 

3.  Every complaint must be made in writing upon the document of carriage or by separate notice in writing despatched within the times aforesaid. 

4.  Failing complaint within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on his part. 

Article 27 

In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his estate. 

Article 28 

1.  An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the Court having jurisdiction where the carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or has an establishment by which the contract has been made or before the Court having jurisdiction at the place of destination. 

2.  Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the Court seised of the case. 

Article 29 

1.  The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped. 

2.  The method of calculating the period of limitation shall be determined by the law of the Court seised of the case. 

Article 30 

1.  In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive carriers and falling within the definition set out in the third paragraph of Article 1, each carrier who accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subjected to the rules set out in this Convention, and is deemed to be one of the contracting parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is performed under his supervision. 

2.  In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his representative can take action only against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey.

3.  As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, or damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee. 

Article 30A 

Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person. 

### Chapter IV—Provisions Relating to Combined Carriage

Article 31 

1.  In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this Convention apply only to the carriage by air, provided that the carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1\. 

2.  Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the parties in the case of combined carriage from inserting in the document of air carriage conditions relating to other modes of carriage, provided that the provisions of this Convention are observed as regards the carriage by air. 

### Chapter V—General and Final Provisions

Article 32 

Any clause contained in the contract and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void. Nevertheless for the carriage of cargo arbitration clauses are allowed, subject to this Convention, if the arbitration is to take place within one of the jurisdictions referred to in the first paragraph of Article 28\. 

Article 33 

Except as provided in paragraph 3 of Article 5, nothing in this Convention shall prevent the carrier either from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage or from making regulations which do not conflict with the provisions of this Convention. 

Article 34 

The provisions of Articles 3 to 8 inclusive relating to documents of carriage shall not apply in the case of carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances outside the normal scope of an air carrier’s business. 

Article 35 

The expression “days” when used in this Convention means current days not working days. 

Article 36 

The Convention is drawn up in French in a single copy which shall remain deposited in the archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Poland and of which one duly certified copy shall be sent by the Polish Government to the Government of each of the High Contracting Parties.

Article 40A 

1.  In Article 37, paragraph 2 and Article 40, paragraph 1, the expression _High Contracting Party_ shall mean _State_. In all other cases, the expression _High Contracting Party_ shall mean a State whose ratification of or adherence to the Convention has become effective and whose denunciation thereof has not become effective. 

2.  For the purposes of the Convention the word _territory_ means not only the metropolitan territory of a State but also all other territories for the foreign relations of which that State is responsible. 

Article 41 

Any High Contracting Party shall be entitled not earlier than two years after the coming into force of this Convention to call for the assembling of a new international Conference in order to consider any improvements which may be made in this Convention. To this end he will communicate with the Government of the French Republic which will take the necessary measures to make preparations for such Conference. 

Additional Protocol<span style="text-transform:uppercase"> </span>

The High Contracting Parties reserve to themselves the right to declare at the time of ratification or of accession that the first paragraph of Article 2 of this Convention shall not apply to international carriage by air performed directly by the State, its colonies, protectorates or mandated territories or by any other territory under its sovereignty, suzerainty or authority.

### Note 2

Subsection 25(1)—As at 8 October 2008, no Proclamation had been published in the _Gazette_ and no denunciation by Australia of the Warsaw Convention had been made.

### Note 3

_Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Amendment Act 1991 (No. 189, 1991)_

Part IIIB (sections 25D–25G, 22H), sections 27 and 42 are amended by sections 9, 11(1) and 13(1) of the _Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Amendment Act 1991_, subsection 2(2) of which provides as follows:

             (2)  Section 9 and subsections 11(1) and 13(1) commence on a day to be fixed by Proclamation, being a day not earlier than that on which the Montreal Protocol No. 3 enters into force for Australia.

The amendments are set out below:

##  9  After Part IIIA of the Principal Act the following Part is inserted _\[see NOTE 1 below]_

## Part IIIB—Carriage to which the Montreal No. 3 Convention applies

##### <a id="25D"></a>25D  Interpretation

                   In this Part:

                    <a name="convent"></a>**_the Convention_** means the Montreal No. 3 Convention.

##### <a id="25E"></a>25E  Effect of Convention in Australia

             (1)  Subject to this Part, the Convention has the force of law in Australia in relation to any carriage by air to which the Convention applies, irrespective of the nationality of the aircraft performing that carriage. 

             (2)  A reference in this Part to the Convention is to be read, unless the contrary intention appears, as a reference to the provisions of the Convention as having the force of law because of this section.

##### <a id="25F"></a>25F  Application of certain provisions of Part IV

                   Sections 35 to 39 (inclusive) apply to carriage to which the Convention applies in the same way as they apply to carriage under Part IV, and for that purpose:

                     (a)  a reference in section 37 to Part IV is taken to be a reference to this Part and the Convention; and

                     (b)  any other reference to Part IV is taken to be a reference to the Convention.

##### <a id="25G"></a>25G  Jurisdiction of State courts preserved

                   For the purposes of section 38 of the _Judiciary Act 1903_, an action under the Convention is taken not to be a matter arising directly under a treaty.

##### <a id="22H"></a>22H  Evidence of certain matters _\[see NOTE 2 below]_

             (1)  The Minister may, by notice published in the _Gazette_, from time to time declare:

                     (a)  who are the Parties to the Convention; and

                     (b)  the territory in respect of which any Party is bound by the Convention; and

                     (c)  the extent to which any Party has availed itself of a reservation permitted by the Convention.

             (2)  A notice under this section is evidence of the matters declared.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Application of Part

             (1)  Section 27 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in subsection (1) “, the Montreal Protocol No. 3” after “the Hague Protocol”.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Stowaways

             (1)  Section 42 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in subsection (1) “, Part IIIB” after “Part III”.

Subsections 7(3)(b) and 8(3)(b) of the _Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Amendment Act 1991_ provide as follows _\[see NOTE 1 below]_:

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Effect of Convention in Australia

             (3)  If section 10 commences before section 9:

                     (b)  on the commencement of section 9, section 25A is amended by omitting “II, III and IIIC” and substituting “II, III, IIIB and IIIC”.

             (1)  The regulations may specify that a number of SDRs exceeding the relevant number of SDRs applies in relation to the liability of an Australian international carrier in respect of the death or injury of a passenger.

but only one action may be brought in Australia in respect of the death of any one passenger.

             (6)  The action to enforce the liability must be for the benefit of all people for whose benefit the liability is enforceable who:

                     (a)  are resident in Australia; or

However, the court may, in such an action, deal with any question of costs in any manner it thinks proper having regard to the operation of the sentence in cases to which it applies.

##### <a id="9E"></a>9E  Liability in respect of injury

                   Subject to section 9F, the liability of a carrier under the Convention, in respect of personal injury suffered by a passenger that has not resulted in the death of the passenger, is in substitution for any civil liability of the carrier under any other law in respect of the injury.

                     (e)  in the case of the death of a passenger, a premium that would have become payable under a contract of insurance in respect of the life of the passenger if the passenger had lived after the time when the passenger died.

##### <a id="9H"></a>9H  Contributory negligence

             (1)  For the purposes of Article 20 of the Convention, if, in an action against a carrier under the Convention relating to damage:

                     (a)  sustained in the case of death or bodily injury of a passenger; or

                     (b)  sustained in the case of destruction or loss of, or of damage to, baggage of a passenger; or

                     (c)  sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, cargo; or

the carrier proves that the damage was caused by, or contributed to by, the negligence of the passenger or the consignor of the cargo, the damages recoverable in respect of the damage must be assessed in accordance with this section.

             (5)  If any case to which subsection (1) applies is tried with a jury, the jury must determine the damages referred to in subsection (2) and the amount of the reduction under subsection (3).

##### <a id="9J"></a>9J  Action against a State Party to the 1999 Montreal Convention which undertakes carriage by air

             (1)  If, at a particular time, an action under the Convention is brought in a court in Australia to enforce a claim in respect of carriage undertaken by a State Party to the 1999 Montreal Convention, the State Party is taken to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, unless:

                     (b)  the declaration is in effect at that time.

CONVENTION

**FOR THE UNIFICATION OF CERTAIN RULES FOR INTERNATIONAL CARRIAGE BY AIR**

THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION

RECOGNIZING the significant contribution of the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed in Warsaw on 12 October 1929, hereinafter referred to as the “Warsaw Convention”, and other related instruments to the harmonization of private international air law;

RECOGNIZING the need to modernize and consolidate the Warsaw Convention and related instruments;

RECOGNIZING the importance of ensuring protection of the interests of consumers in international carriage by air and the need for equitable compensation based on the principle of restitution;

REAFFIRMING the desirability of an orderly development of international air transport operations and the smooth flow of passengers, baggage and cargo in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, done at Chicago on 7 December 1944;

CONVINCED that collective State action for further harmonization and codification of certain rules governing international carriage by air through a new Convention is the most adequate means of achieving an equitable balance of interests;

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

**Chapter I**

General Provisions

**Article 1 — Scope of Application**

1.         This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.

2.         For the purposes of this Convention, the expression _international carriage_ means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two States Parties, or within the territory of a single State Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a State Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single State Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.

3.         Carriage to be performed by several successive carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.

4.         This Convention applies also to carriage as set out in Chapter V, subject to the terms contained therein.

**Article 2 — Carriage Performed by State and Carriage of Postal Items**

1.         This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1.

2.         In the carriage of postal items, the carrier shall be liable only to the relevant postal administration in accordance with the rules applicable to the relationship between the carriers and the postal administrations.

3.         Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this Convention shall not apply to the carriage of postal items.

**Chapter II**

Documentation and Duties of the Parties Relating to the Carriage of

Passengers, Baggage and Cargo

**Article 3 — Passengers and Baggage**

1.         In respect of carriage of passengers, an individual or collective document of carriage shall be delivered containing:

(a)                    an indication of the places of departure and destination;

(b)                    if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single State Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place.

2.         Any other means which preserves the information indicated in paragraph 1 may be substituted for the delivery of the document referred to in that paragraph. If any such other means is used, the carrier shall offer to deliver to the passenger a written statement of the information so preserved.

3.         The carrier shall deliver to the passenger a baggage identification tag for each piece of checked baggage.

4.         The passenger shall be given written notice to the effect that where this Convention is applicable it governs and may limit the liability of carriers in respect of death or injury and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay.

5.         Non-compliance with the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, nonetheless, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability.

**Article 4 — Cargo**

1.         In respect of the carriage of cargo, an air waybill shall be delivered.

2.         Any other means which preserves a record of the carriage to be performed may be substituted for the delivery of an air waybill. If such other means are used, the carrier shall, if so requested by the consignor, deliver to the consignor a cargo receipt permitting identification of the consignment and access to the information contained in the record preserved by such other means.

**Article 5 — Contents of Air Waybill or Cargo Receipt**

The air waybill or the cargo receipt shall include:

(a)                    an indication of the places of departure and destination;

(b)                    if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single State Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; and

(c)                    an indication of the weight of the consignment.

**Article 6 — Document Relating to the Nature of the Cargo**

The consignor may be required, if necessary to meet the formalities of customs, police and similar public authorities, to deliver a document indicating the nature of the cargo. This provision creates for the carrier no duty, obligation or liability resulting therefrom.

**Article 7 — Description of Air Waybill**

1.         The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original parts.

2.         The first part shall be marked “for the carrier”; it shall be signed by the consignor. The second part shall be marked “for the consignee”; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier. The third part shall be signed by the carrier who shall hand it to the consignor after the cargo has been accepted.

3.         The signature of the carrier and that of the consignor may be printed or stamped.

4.         If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, the carrier shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf of the consignor.

**Article 8 — Documentation for Multiple Packages**

When there is more than one package:

(a)                    the carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate air waybills;

(b)                    the consignor has the right to require the carrier to deliver separate cargo receipts when the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4 are used.

**Article 9 — Non-compliance with Documentary Requirements**

Non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 4 to 8 shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, nonetheless, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability.

**Article 10 — Responsibility for Particulars of Documentation**

1.         The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and statements relating to the cargo inserted by it or on its behalf in the air waybill or furnished by it or on its behalf to the carrier for insertion in the cargo receipt or for insertion in the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4\. The foregoing shall also apply where the person acting on behalf of the consignor is also the agent of the carrier.

2.         The consignor shall indemnify the carrier against all damage suffered by it, or by any other person to whom the carrier is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements furnished by the consignor or on its behalf.

3.         Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the carrier shall indemnify the consignor against all damage suffered by it, or by any other person to whom the consignor is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements inserted by the carrier or on its behalf in the cargo receipt or in the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4.

**Article 11 — Evidentiary Value of Documentation**

1.         The air waybill or the cargo receipt is _prima facie_ evidence of the conclusion of the contract, of the acceptance of the cargo and of the conditions of carriage mentioned therein.

2.         Any statements in the air waybill or the cargo receipt relating to the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the number of packages, are _prima facie_ evidence of the facts stated; those relating to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the air waybill or the cargo receipt to have been, checked by it in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.

**Article 12 — Right of Disposition of Cargo**

1.         Subject to its liability to carry out all its obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the airport of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee originally designated, or by requiring it to be returned to the airport of departure. The consignor must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and must reimburse any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right.

2.         If it is impossible to carry out the instructions of the consignor, the carrier must so inform the consignor forthwith.

3.         If the carrier carries out the instructions of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt delivered to the latter, the carrier will be liable, without prejudice to its right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt.

4.         The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13\. Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the cargo, or cannot be communicated with, the consignor resumes its right of disposition.

**Article 13 — Delivery of the Cargo**

1.         Except when the consignor has exercised its right under Article 12, the consignee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to require the carrier to deliver the cargo to it, on payment of the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage.

2.         Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives.

3.         If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.

**Article 14 — Enforcement of the Rights of Consignor and Consignee**

The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given to them by Articles 12 and 13, each in its own name, whether it is acting in its own interest or in the interest of another, provided that it carries out the obligations imposed by the contract of carriage.

**Article 15 — Relations of Consignor and Consignee or**

**Mutual Relations of Third Parties**

1.         Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor and the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee.

2.         The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express provision in the air waybill or the cargo receipt.

**Article 16 — Formalities of Customs, Police or Other Public Authorities**

1.         The consignor must furnish such information and such documents as are necessary to meet the formalities of customs, police and any other public authorities before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of the carrier, its servants or agents.

2.         The carrier is under no obligation to enquire into the correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents.

**Chapter III**

Liability of the Carrier and Extent of Compensation for Damage

**Article 17 — Death and Injury of Passengers — Damage to Baggage**

1.         The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of death or bodily injury of a passenger upon condition only that the accident which caused the death or injury took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.

2.         The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of destruction or loss of, or of damage to, checked baggage upon condition only that the event which caused the destruction, loss or damage took place on board the aircraft or during any period within which the checked baggage was in the charge of the carrier. However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent that the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage. In the case of unchecked baggage, including personal items, the carrier is liable if the damage resulted from its fault or that of its servants or agents.

3.         If the carrier admits the loss of the checked baggage, or if the checked baggage has not arrived at the expiration of twenty-one days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the passenger is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.

4.         Unless otherwise specified, in this Convention the term “baggage” means both checked baggage and unchecked baggage.

**Article 18 — Damage to Cargo**

1.         The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the event which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air.

2.         However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent it proves that the destruction, or loss of, or damage to, the cargo resulted from one or more of the following:

(a)                    inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo;

(b)                    defective packing of that cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or its servants or agents;

(c)                    an act of war or an armed conflict;

(d)                    an act of public authority carried out in connection with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo.

3.         The carriage by air within the meaning of paragraph 1 of this Article comprises the period during which the cargo is in the charge of the carrier.

4.         The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by inland waterway performed outside an airport. If, however, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air. If a carrier, without the consent of the consignor, substitutes carriage by another mode of transport for the whole or part of a carriage intended by the agreement between the parties to be carriage by air, such carriage by another mode of transport is deemed to be within the period of carriage by air.

**Article 19 — Delay**

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. Nevertheless, the carrier shall not be liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures.

**Article 20 — Exoneration**

If the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he or she derives his or her rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage. When by reason of death or injury of a passenger compensation is claimed by a person other than the passenger, the carrier shall likewise be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the extent that it proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of that passenger. This Article applies to all the liability provisions in this Convention, including paragraph 1 of Article 21.

**Article 21 — Compensation in Case of Death or Injury of Passengers**

1.         For damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 not exceeding 100 000 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger, the carrier shall not be able to exclude or limit its liability.

2.         The carrier shall not be liable for damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 to the extent that they exceed for each passenger 100 000 Special Drawing Rights if the carrier proves that:

(a)                    such damage was not due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the carrier or its servants or agents; or

(b)                    such damage was solely due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of a third party.

**Article 22 — Limits of Liability in Relation to Delay, Baggage and Cargo**

1.         In the case of damage caused by delay as specified in Article 19 in the carriage of persons, the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to 4 150 Special Drawing Rights.

2.         In the carriage of baggage, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to 1 000 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger unless the passenger has made, at the time when the checked baggage was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the passenger’s actual interest in delivery at destination.

3.         In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination.

4.         In the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay of part of the cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the destruction, loss, damage or delay of a part of the cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same air waybill, or the same receipt or, if they were not issued, by the same record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.

5.         The foregoing provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, its servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that such servant or agent was acting within the scope of its employment.

6.         The limits prescribed in Article 21 and in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff, including interest. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.

**Article 23 — Conversion of Monetary Units**

1.         The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Convention shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgement. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgement, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.

2.         Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article may, at the time of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier prescribed in Article 21 is fixed at a sum of 1 500 000 monetary units per passenger in judicial proceedings in their territories; 62 500 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 of Article 22; 15 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 2 of Article 22; and 250 monetary units per kilogramme with respect to paragraph 3 of Article 22\. This monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.

3.         The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this Article and the conversion method mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in Articles 21 and 22 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 1 of this Article. States Parties shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 2 of this Article as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.

**Article 24 — Review of Limits**

1.         Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 25 of this Convention and subject to paragraph 2 below, the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 21, 22 and 23 shall be reviewed by the Depositary at five-year intervals, the first such review to take place at the end of the fifth year following the date of entry into force of this Convention, or if the Convention does not enter into force within five years of the date it is first open for signature, within the first year of its entry into force, by reference to an inflation factor which corresponds to the accumulated rate of inflation since the previous revision or in the first instance since the date of entry into force of the Convention. The measure of the rate of inflation to be used in determining the inflation factor shall be the weighted average of the annual rates of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Indices of the States whose currencies comprise the Special Drawing Right mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 23.

2.         If the review referred to in the preceding paragraph concludes that the inflation factor has exceeded 10 per cent, the Depositary shall notify States Parties of a revision of the limits of liability. Any such revision shall become effective six months after its notification to the States Parties. If within three months after its notification to the States Parties a majority of the States Parties register their disapproval, the revision shall not become effective and the Depositary shall refer the matter to a meeting of the States Parties. The Depositary shall immediately notify all States Parties of the coming into force of any revision.

3.         Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the procedure referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied at any time provided that one-third of the States Parties express a desire to that effect and upon condition that the inflation factor referred to in paragraph 1 has exceeded 30 per cent since the previous revision or since the date of entry into force of this Convention if there has been no previous revision. Subsequent reviews using the procedure described in paragraph 1 of this Article will take place at five-year intervals starting at the end of the fifth year following the date of the reviews under the present paragraph.

**Article 25 — Stipulation on Limits**

A carrier may stipulate that the contract of carriage shall be subject to higher limits of liability than those provided for in this Convention or to no limits of liability whatsoever.

**Article 26 — Invalidity of Contractual Provisions**

Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.

**Article 27 — Freedom to Contract**

Nothing contained in this Convention shall prevent the carrier from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage, from waiving any defences available under the Convention, or from laying down conditions which do not conflict with the provisions of this Convention.

**Article 28 — Advance Payments**

In the case of aircraft accidents resulting in death or injury of passengers, the carrier shall, if required by its national law, make advance payments without delay to a natural person or persons who are entitled to claim compensation in order to meet the immediate economic needs of such persons. Such advance payments shall not constitute a recognition of liability and may be offset against any amounts subsequently paid as damages by the carrier.

**Article 29 — Basis of Claims**

In the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and such limits of liability as are set out in this Convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. In any such action, punitive, exemplary or any other non-compensatory damages shall not be recoverable.

**Article 30 — Servants, Agents — Aggregation of Claims**

1.         If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which the Convention relates, such servant or agent, if they prove that they acted within the scope of their employment, shall be entitled to avail themselves of the conditions and limits of liability which the carrier itself is entitled to invoke under this Convention.

2.         The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, its servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits.

3.         Save in respect of the carriage of cargo, the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

**Article 31 — Timely Notice of Complaints**

1.         Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of checked baggage or cargo without complaint is _prima facie_ evidence that the same has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the document of carriage or with the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 3 and paragraph 2 of Article 4.

2.         In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of checked baggage and fourteen days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo. In the case of delay, the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his or her disposal.

3.         Every complaint must be made in writing and given or dispatched within the times aforesaid.

4.         If no complaint is made within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on its part.

**Article 32 — Death of Person Liable**

In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his or her estate.

**Article 33 — Jurisdiction**

1.         An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before the court of the domicile of the carrier or of its principal place of business, or where it has a place of business through which the contract has been made or before the court at the place of destination.

2.         In respect of damage resulting from the death or injury of a passenger, an action may be brought before one of the courts mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, or in the territory of a State Party in which at the time of the accident the passenger has his or her principal and permanent residence and to or from which the carrier operates services for the carriage of passengers by air, either on its own aircraft, or on another carrier’s aircraft pursuant to a commercial agreement, and in which that carrier conducts its business of carriage of passengers by air from premises leased or owned by the carrier itself or by another carrier with which it has a commercial agreement.

3.         For the purposes of paragraph 2,

(a)                    “commercial agreement” means an agreement, other than an agency agreement, made between carriers and relating to the provision of their joint services for carriage of passengers by air;

(b)                    “principal and permanent residence” means the one fixed and permanent abode of the passenger at the time of the accident. The nationality of the passenger shall not be the determining factor in this regard.

4.         Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the court seised of the case.

**Article 34 — Arbitration**

1.         Subject to the provisions of this Article, the parties to the contract of carriage for cargo may stipulate that any dispute relating to the liability of the carrier under this Convention shall be settled by arbitration. Such agreement shall be in writing.

2.         The arbitration proceedings shall, at the option of the claimant, take place within one of the jurisdictions referred to in Article 33.

3.         The arbitrator or arbitration tribunal shall apply the provisions of this Convention.

4.         The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall be deemed to be part of every arbitration clause or agreement, and any term of such clause or agreement which is inconsistent therewith shall be null and void.

**Article 35 — Limitation of Actions**

1.         The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within a period of two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped.

2.         The method of calculating that period shall be determined by the law of the court seised of the case.

**Article 36 — Successive Carriage**

1.         In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive carriers and falling within the definition set out in paragraph 3 of Article 1, each carrier which accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subject to the rules set out in this Convention and is deemed to be one of the parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is performed under its supervision.

2.         In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or any person entitled to compensation in respect of him or her can take action only against the carrier which performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey.

3.         As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier which performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.

**Article 37 — Right of Recourse against Third Parties**

Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.

**Chapter IV**

Combined Carriage

**Article 38 — Combined Carriage**

1.         In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this Convention shall, subject to paragraph 4 of Article 18, apply only to the carriage by air, provided that the carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1.

2.         Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the parties in the case of combined carriage from inserting in the document of air carriage conditions relating to other modes of carriage, provided that the provisions of this Convention are observed as regards the carriage by air.

**Chapter V**

Carriage by Air Performed by a Person

other than the Contracting Carrier

**Article 39 — Contracting Carrier — Actual Carrier**

The provisions of this Chapter apply when a person (hereinafter referred to as “the contracting carrier”) as a principal makes a contract of carriage governed by this Convention with a passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the passenger or consignor, and another person (hereinafter referred to as “the actual carrier”) performs, by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier, the whole or part of the carriage, but is not with respect to such part a successive carrier within the meaning of this Convention. Such authority shall be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary.

**Article 40 — Respective Liability of Contracting and Actual Carriers**

If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the contract referred to in Article 39, is governed by this Convention, both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, be subject to the rules of this Convention, the former for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the contract, the latter solely for the carriage which it performs.

**Article 41 — Mutual Liability**

1.         The acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of its servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the contracting carrier.

2.         The acts and omissions of the contracting carrier and of its servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the actual carrier. Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual carrier to liability exceeding the amounts referred to in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24\. Any special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or any waiver of rights or defences conferred by this Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery at destination contemplated in Article 22 shall not affect the actual carrier unless agreed to by it.

**Article 42 — Addressee of Complaints and Instructions**

Any complaint to be made or instruction to be given under this Convention to the carrier shall have the same effect whether addressed to the contracting carrier or to the actual carrier. Nevertheless, instructions referred to in Article 12 shall only be effective if addressed to the contracting carrier.

**Article 43 — Servants and Agents**

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent of that carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if they prove that they acted within the scope of their employment, be entitled to avail themselves of the conditions and limits of liability which are applicable under this Convention to the carrier whose servant or agent they are, unless it is proved that they acted in a manner that prevents the limits of liability from being invoked in accordance with this Convention.

**Article 44 — Aggregation of Damages**

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment, shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the contracting carrier or the actual carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to that person.

**Article 45 — Addressee of Claims**

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or against both together or separately. If the action is brought against only one of those carriers, that carrier shall have the right to require the other carrier to be joined in the proceedings, the procedure and effects being governed by the law of the court seised of the case.

**Article 46 — Additional Jurisdiction**

Any action for damages contemplated in Article 45 must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before a court in which an action may be brought against the contracting carrier, as provided in Article 33, or before the court having jurisdiction at the place where the actual carrier has its domicile or its principal place of business.

**Article 47 — Invalidity of Contractual Provisions**

Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the actual carrier of liability under this Chapter or to fix a lower limit than that which is applicable according to this Chapter shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Chapter.

**Article 48 — Mutual Relations of Contracting and Actual Carriers**

Except as provided in Article 45, nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the carriers between themselves, including any right of recourse or indemnification.

**Chapter VI**

Other Provisions

**Article 49 — Mandatory Application**

Any clause contained in the contract of carriage and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void.

**Article 50 — Insurance**

States Parties shall require their carriers to maintain adequate insurance covering their liability under this Convention. A carrier may be required by the State Party into which it operates to furnish evidence that it maintains adequate insurance covering its liability under this Convention.

**Article 51 — Carriage Performed in Extraordinary Circumstances**

The provisions of Articles 3 to 5, 7 and 8 relating to the documentation of carriage shall not apply in the case of carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances outside the normal scope of a carrier’s business.

**Article 52 — Definition of Days**

The expression “days” when used in this Convention means calendar days, not working days.
