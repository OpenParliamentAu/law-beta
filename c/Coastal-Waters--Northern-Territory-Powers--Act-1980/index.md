                    <a name="coastal-water-territori"></a>**_coastal waters of the Territory_** means:

                     (a)  the part or parts of the territorial sea of Australia that is or are within the adjacent area in respect of the Territory, other than any part referred to in subsection 4(2); and

                     (b)  any sea that is on the landward side of any part of the territorial sea of Australia and is within the adjacent area in respect of the Territory but is not within the limits of the Territory.

                    <a name="territori"></a>**_Territory_** means the Northern Territory of Australia.

             (2)  The _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, in the form in which it was in force, as amended, immediately before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent, applies to the interpretation of this Act.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Extent of territorial sea and coastal waters

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, the limits of the territorial sea of Australia shall be the limits existing from time to time, ascertained consistently with the _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973_ and instruments under that Act and with any agreement (whether made before or after the commencement of this Act) for the time being in force between Australia and another country with respect to the outer limit of a particular part of that territorial sea.

             (2)  If at any time the breadth of the territorial sea of Australia is determined or declared to be greater than 3 nautical miles, references in this Act to the coastal waters of the Territory do not include any part of the territorial sea of Australia that would not be within the limits of that territorial sea if the breadth of that territorial sea had continued to be 3 nautical miles.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Legislative powers of Territory

                   The legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory conferred by section 6 of the _Northern Territory__(Self-Government) Act 1978_ extend to the making of:

                     (a)  all such laws of the Territory as could be made by virtue of those powers if the coastal waters of the Territory, as extending from time to time, were within the limits of the Territory, including laws applying in or in relation to the sea-bed and subsoil beneath, and the airspace above, the coastal waters of the Territory;

                     (b)  laws of the Territory having effect in or in relation to waters within the adjacent area in respect of the Territory but beyond the outer limits of the coastal waters of the Territory, including laws applying in or in relation to the sea-bed and subsoil beneath, and the airspace above, the first-mentioned waters, being laws with respect to:

##### <a id="6"></a>6  International status of territorial sea

                   Nothing in this Act affects the status of the territorial sea of Australia under international law or the rights and duties of the Commonwealth in relation to ensuring the observance of international law, including the provisions of international agreements binding on the Commonwealth and, in particular, the provisions of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone relating to the right of innocent passage of ships.
