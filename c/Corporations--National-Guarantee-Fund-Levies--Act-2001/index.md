##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Act 2001_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences at the same time as the _Corporations Act 2001_.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Definitions

                   Expressions used in this Act that are defined in a provision of the _Corporations Act 2001_ that applies for the purposes of Division 4 of Part 7.5 of that Act (whether it also applies for other purposes) have the same meanings in this Act as they are given by that provision.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Imposition of levies in respect of National Guarantee Fund

                   The following levies are imposed by this Act:

                     (a)  any levy that is payable under section 889J of the _Corporations Act 2001_;

                     (b)  any levy that is payable under section 889K of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

These levies relate to the situation in which the amount in the National Guarantee Fund is less than the minimum amount referred to in section 889I of the _Corporations Act 2001_.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Amount of levy

             (1)  A determination referred to in subsection 889J(1) of the _Corporations Act 2001_ must specify, or specify a method for determining, the amount of levy that is to be payable. The amount of levy imposed by paragraph 4(a) of this Act in relation to the determination is the amount specified in, or worked out in accordance with the method specified in, the determination.

             (2)  A determination referred to in subsection 889K(1) of the _Corporations Act 2001_ must specify, or specify a method for determining, the amount of levy that is to be payable. The amount of levy imposed by paragraph 4(b) of this Act in relation to the determination is the amount specified in, or worked out in accordance with the method specified in, the determination.

             (3)  Different amounts or methods may be specified in the same determination (whether it is a determination referred to in subsection 889J(1) or a determination referred to in subsection 889K(1)) in relation to different classes of matters of things.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Transitional matters—implementation of the _Corporations Act 2001_

             (1)  If, immediately before the commencement of this Act, an amount was payable by a person to a securities exchange under section 938 of the old Corporations Law of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction, a liability to pay a levy of the same amount, in respect of the same matter, to the Commonwealth is imposed on the person by this subsection on the commencement of this Act.

             (2)  If, immediately before the commencement of this Act, an amount was payable by a person to SEGC under section 940 of the old Corporations Law of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction, a liability to pay a levy of the same amount, in respect of the same matter, to the Commonwealth is imposed on the person by this subsection on the commencement of this Act.

                     (b)  if the determination had effect for the purposes of subsection 5(3) of this Act as then in force—a determination for the purposes of subsection 5(2) of this Act as in force after the commencement.
