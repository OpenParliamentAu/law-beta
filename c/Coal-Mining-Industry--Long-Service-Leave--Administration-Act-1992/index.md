                     (a)  the amount that it is estimated will be the liability of employers at that date to make payments to eligible employees in respect of long service leave that will have accrued at that date; and

                     (b)  the rate of the payroll levy that, having regard to the amount to be transferred to the Fund under section 35, needs to be imposed to ensure that:

                              (i)  the Fund will be sufficient on and after that date to discharge the liability of employers to make payments to eligible employees in respect of long service leave accruing on and after that date; and

                             (ii)  the Fund will be sufficient at the end of the period of 10 years after that date to discharge so much of the liability of employers to make payments referred to in paragraph (a) as is not discharged before the end of that period.

             (2)  The Board must seek to obtain, within 6 months before each review date, advice from an actuary as to:

                     (a)  whether the rate of payroll levy imposed when the advice is given would be adequate to ensure that:

                              (i)  the Fund will be sufficient on and after that review date to discharge the liability of employers to make payments to eligible employees in respect of long service leave that accrued or will accrue on or after the commencing date; and

                             (ii)  the Fund will be sufficient at the end of the period of 10 years after the commencing date to discharge so much of the liability of employers to make payments to eligible employees in respect of long service leave that accrued before the commencing date as is not discharged before the end of that period; and

                     (b)  if not, the rate that would be so adequate.

             (3)  The dates that are 3 years, 5 years and 7 years, respectively, after the commencing date are review dates for the purposes of subsection (2).

             (4)  The Board must seek to obtain, within 6 months before the end of the period of 10 years after the commencing date, advice from an actuary as to:

                     (a)  whether the Fund will be sufficient at the end of that period to discharge so much of the liability of employers to make payments to eligible employees in respect of long service leave that will have accrued at the end of that period as had not been discharged before the end of that period and, if not, the amount of any deficiency; and

                     (b)  the rate of payroll levy that would need to be imposed to ensure that the Fund will be sufficient:

                              (i)  to discharge the liability of employers to make payments to eligible employees in respect of long service leave accruing after the end of that period; and

                             (ii)  to meet any deficiency referred to in paragraph (a).

             (5)  When the Board obtains advice from an actuary in respect of any matters referred to in this section, the Board must notify the Minister of the terms of the advice and make a recommendation to the Minister as to whether the rate of payroll levy needs to be changed and, if so, the rate that should be imposed.

             (6)  If the Board forms the opinion, having regard to any advice obtained by it under this section, that the Fund is likely within the ensuing 12 months to be sufficient to discharge the liability of employers to make payments to eligible employees in respect of long service leave, the Board must give to the Minister a written report stating that it has formed that opinion and setting out the reasons for that opinion.

             (7)  If at any time the Board considers that the amount standing to the credit of the Fund exceeds the amount required to be retained in the Fund to make any payments that will need to be made out of the Fund, the Board may distribute the excess among such persons who have paid payroll levy, and in such amounts, as the Board considers equitable.
