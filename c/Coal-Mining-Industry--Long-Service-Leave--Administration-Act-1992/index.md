Note:          This means that an employer of an eligible employee is not required to pay payroll levy in respect of eligible wages paid to the employee while the waiver agreement is in effect. However, returns made by the employer under section 5 of the Payroll Levy Collection Act while the waiver agreement is in effect will still need to include information in relation to the employee.

##### <a id="39BE"></a>39BE  Employer must comply with waiver agreement

             (1)  If a waiver agreement is in effect between an employee and an employer, the employer must pay the additional remuneration or make the additional contributions or both pay the additional remuneration and make the additional contributions (as the case may be) in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

             (4)  A payment by the Corporation under this section:

                     (a)  discharges the liability of the employer to make the payment; and

Note:          For continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions, see section 49CA.

             (2)  However, the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered for each of the contraventions.

                   Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as conduct that would constitute a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### <a id="49BC"></a>49BC  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

             (1)  Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual for an offence if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the individual for an alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to criminal proceedings in relation to the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

### Division 3—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="49C"></a>49C  Ancillary contravention of civil penalty provisions

             (1)  A person must not:

                     (a)  attempt to contravene a civil penalty provision; or

                     (c)  induce (by threats, promises or otherwise) a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

                     (e)  conspire with others to effect a contravention of a civil penalty provision.

Note:          Section 49CC (which provides that a person’s state of mind does not need to be proven in relation to a civil penalty provision) does not apply to this subsection.

Civil penalty

             (2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) in relation to a civil penalty provision is taken to have contravened the provision.

##### <a id="49CA"></a>49CA  Continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions

             (1)  If an act or thing is required under a civil penalty provision to be done:

                     (a)  within a particular period; or

                     (b)  before a particular time;

then the obligation to do that act or thing continues until the act or thing is done (even if the period has expired or the time has passed).

             (2)  A person who contravenes a civil penalty provision that requires an act or thing to be done:

                     (a)  within a particular period; or

                     (b)  before a particular time;

commits a separate contravention of that provision in respect of each day during which the contravention occurs (including the day the relevant civil penalty order is made or any later day).

##### <a id="49CB"></a>49CB  Mistake of fact

             (1)  A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

                              (i)  considered whether or not facts existed; and

                             (ii)  was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

                     (b)  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

                     (a)  the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

             (3)  A person who wishes to rely on subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="evidenti-burden"></a>**_evidential burden_**, in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist.

##### <a id="49CC"></a>49CC  State of mind

             (1)  In proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (other than subsection 49C(1)), it is not necessary to prove:

                     (a)  the person’s intention; or

                     (b)  the person’s knowledge; or

                     (c)  the person’s recklessness; or

                     (d)  the person’s negligence; or

                     (e)  any other state of mind of the person.

             (2)  Subsection (1) of this section does not affect the operation of section 49CB (which is about mistake of fact).

##### <a id="49CD"></a>49CD  Civil penalty provisions contravened by employees, agents or officers

                   If an element of a civil penalty provision is done by an employee, agent or officer of a body corporate acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, the element must also be attributed to the body corporate.

##### <a id="49CE"></a>49CE  Civil penalty provisions contravened by executive officers

             (1)  An executive officer of a body corporate contravenes this subsection if:

                     (a)  the body corporate contravenes a civil penalty provision; and

                     (b)  the officer knew that the contravention would occur; and

                     (c)  the officer was in a position to influence the conduct of the body in relation to the contravention; and

                     (d)  the officer failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.

             (2)  Subsection (1) is a **_civil penalty provision_**.

##### <a id="49CF"></a>49CF  Establishing whether an executive officer took reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of a civil penalty provision

             (1)  For the purposes of section 49CE, in determining whether an executive officer of a body corporate failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of a civil penalty provision, a court is to have regard to:

                     (a)  what action (if any) the officer took towards ensuring that the body’s employees, agents and contractors have a reasonable knowledge and understanding of the requirements to comply with this Act and the Payroll Levy Collection Act, in so far as those requirements affect the employees, agents or contractors concerned; and

                     (b)  what action (if any) the officer took when he or she became aware that the body was contravening this Act or the Payroll Levy Collection Act.

             (2)  This section does not, by implication, limit the generality of section 49CE.
