                     (a)  where a particular quantity of goods was required to be so entered to comply fully with the undertaking—the quantity of goods so entered bears to that particular quantity; or

                     (b)  where a quantity of goods of a particular value was required to be so entered to comply fully with the undertaking—the value of the goods so entered bears to that particular value.
