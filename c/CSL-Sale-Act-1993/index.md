##### <a id="15"></a>15  Interpretation

             (1)  Unless the contrary intention appears, expressions used in this Division that are also used in the Long Service Leave Act have the same respective meanings as in that Act.

                    <a name="employe"></a>**_employee_** includes a person employed in a full‑time or a part‑time capacity.

                    <a name="law"></a>**_law_** means:

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Long service leave for employees with less than 10 years service

             (1)  This section provides that, in certain circumstances, a CSL body may grant long service leave to an employee whose period of service for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act was less than 10 years.

             (2)  This section applies in relation to a person who was an employee of CSL immediately before the sale day if, at that time, the employee’s period of service for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act was less than 10 years.

             (3)  This section does not apply in relation to an employee who stops being an employee of a CSL body by dying. Section 18 covers those employees.

             (4)  If, from and after the sale day, the employee continues to be employed by a CSL body until his or her combined service period is at least 10 years, the CSL body may grant the employee long service leave on full salary for a period up to the employee’s long service leave credit under subsection 19(1).

             (5)  If:

             (7)  Long service leave granted in the circumstances set out in subsection (5) is to be taken so as to end immediately before the employee stops being an employee.

             (8)  For the purposes of this section, the rate of salary to be used in working out the full salary of an employee is the rate that would be applicable to the employee under section 20 of the Long Service Leave Act as if:

the CSL body must pay him or her an amount equal to full salary in respect of his or her long service leave credit under subsection 19(2).

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), if:

                     (a)  the employee stops being an employee of a CSL body; and

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Saving—DPP Act
