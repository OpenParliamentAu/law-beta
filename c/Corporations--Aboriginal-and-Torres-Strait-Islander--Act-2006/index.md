                   If an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is registered under Part 2‑3 as a result of an application made under section 21‑1, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation comes into existence as a body corporate with perpetual succession at the beginning of the day on which it is registered.

Note:          The corporation remains in existence until it is deregistered (see Chapter 12).

##### <a id="42‑3"></a>42‑3  Effect of registration of existing body corporate under Part 2‑3

                   If a body corporate is registered under Part 2‑3 as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation as a result of an application made under section 22‑1, registration under Part 2‑3 does not:

                     (a)  create a new legal entity; or

                     (c)  render defective any legal proceedings by or against the body or its members.

Note:          The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation remains in existence until it is deregistered (see Chapter 12).

##### <a id="42‑4"></a>42‑4  Effect of registration of amalgamated corporation under Part 2‑3

             (2)  The amalgamated corporation comes into existence as a body corporate with perpetual succession at the beginning of the day on which it is registered.

Note:          The amalgamated corporation remains in existence until it is deregistered (see Chapter 12).

             (3)  On registration:

                     (a)  the assets of each of the amalgamating corporations cease to be assets of the amalgamating corporation and become assets of the amalgamated corporation without any conveyance, transfer or assignment and the amalgamated corporation becomes the amalgamating corporation’s successor in law in relation to those assets; and

                     (b)  the liabilities of each of the amalgamating corporations cease to be liabilities of the amalgamating corporations and become liabilities of the amalgamated corporation and the amalgamated corporation becomes the amalgamating corporation’s successor in law in relation to those liabilities; and

Note 1:       The Registrar deregisters the amalgamating corporations under subsection 546‑10(3).

Note 2:       Paragraph (3)(e) has the effect, for example, that any regulatory action taken in relation to an amalgamating corporation under Part 10‑3 may be continued as if that action had been taken in relation to the amalgamated corporation.

             (4)  Paragraph (3)(e) does not apply to a determination under section 487‑1 that an amalgamating corporation is to be under special administration.

             (5)  To avoid doubt, if an asset of an amalgamating corporation was, immediately before registration, subject to a charge of any kind, the asset becomes the asset of the amalgamated corporation under subsection (3) subject to that charge.

             (6)  Subsection (7) applies if:

                     (a)  any land vests in the amalgamated corporation under this section; and

                     (a)  any asset other than land vests in the amalgamated corporation under this section; and

                     (b)  there is lodged with an assets official a certificate that:

                              (i)  is signed by the Registrar; and

                             (ii)  identifies the asset; and

                            (iii)  states that the asset has become vested in the amalgamated corporation under this section.

             (9)  The assets official may:

                     (a)  deal with, and give effect to, the certificate as if it were a proper and appropriate instrument for transactions in relation to assets of that kind; and

                     (b)  make such entries in the register as are necessary having regard to the effect of this section.

           (10)  No stamp duty or other tax is payable under a law of a State or a Territory in respect of an exempt matter, or anything connected with an exempt matter.

           (13)  For the purposes of this section, an **_exempt matter_** is:

                     (a)  the vesting of an asset or liability under this section; or

# Chapter 3—Basic features of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation

## Part 3‑1—Introduction

### Division 52—Introduction

##### <a id="52‑1"></a>52‑1  What this Chapter is about

* * *

This Chapter deals with the internal governance rules, the minimum number of members requirement, names and the powers of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation. It also deals with other basic matters affecting an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation.

* * *

## Part 3‑2—Rules dealing with the internal governance of corporations

### Division 57—Introduction

##### <a id="57‑1"></a>57‑1  What this Part is about

* * *

The rules dealing with the internal governance of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation are of 4 kinds:

               (a)     common law rules; and

              (b)     rules in this Act that cannot be replaced by the corporation’s constitution; and

               (c)     replaceable rules in this Act that may be modified or replaced by the corporation’s constitution; and

              (d)     rules that are in the corporation’s constitution.

Some of the rules in paragraph (d):

               (a)     may be required by this Act to be in the constitution; or

              (b)     may be there to modify or replace a replaceable rule; or

               (c)     may be there as a special rule applying to that particular corporation.

This Part deals with the rules in paragraphs (c) and (d) and refers to them as internal governance rules of the corporation (see section 63‑1).

The corporation may choose to adopt all or some of the replaceable rules as rules of its internal governance.

The corporation’s internal governance rules must comply with the internal governance rules requirements (see Division 66).

There are a number of ways the corporation’s constitution may be changed. Any changes must comply with the internal governance rules requirements (see Division 69).

Division 72 deals with other matters concerning constitutions.

* * *

##### <a id="57‑5"></a>57‑5  List of internal governance rules

                   The following table sets out the main provisions of this Act that deal with the internal governance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. The table indicates those rules that operate as replaceable rules and Division 60 tells you how replaceable rules operate.

### Division 60—What are the replaceable rules and when do they apply to a corporation?

##### <a id="60‑1"></a>60‑1  Replaceable rules

Which are the replaceable rules?

             (1)  A section or subsection whose heading contains the words “replaceable rule—see section 60‑1” is a replaceable rule.

To which corporations do the replaceable rules apply?

             (2)  The replaceable rules apply to:

                     (a)  an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation (not being a corporation to which paragraph (b) applies) that is registered on or after the day this section commences (the **_commencing day_**); and

                     (b)  an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation:

                              (i)  that was registered under the _Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976_ as an Aboriginal corporation immediately before the commencing day; and

                             (ii)  that repeals its constitution after the commencing day;

except to the extent to which the rules are modified or replaced by the corporation’s constitution as provided for in section 60‑5.

##### <a id="60‑5"></a>60‑5  Corporation’s constitution can modify or replace replaceable rules

                   A provision of a section or subsection of a replaceable rule that applies to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation can be modified or replaced by the corporation’s constitution.

Note:          In modifying or replacing a replaceable rule, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation must ensure that the matter covered by the original replaceable rule is provided for in the corporation’s constitution. If it is not, then the constitution may not be covering the matters provided for in the replaceable rules (see section 66‑1).

##### <a id="60‑10"></a>60‑10  Effect of constitution and replaceable rules

             (1)  An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation’s constitution, and any replaceable rules that apply to the corporation, have effect as a contract:

                     (a)  between the corporation and each member; and

                     (b)  between the corporation and each director and corporation secretary; and

                     (c)  between a member and each other member.

             (2)  Under the contract, each person agrees to observe and perform the requirements of the constitution and rules so far as they apply to that person.

##### <a id="60‑15"></a>60‑15  Failure to comply with replaceable rules

                   A failure to comply with the replaceable rules as they apply to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is not of itself a contravention of this Act (so the provisions about criminal liability, civil liability and injunctions do not apply).

##### <a id="60‑20"></a>60‑20  Modification by regulations

             (1)  The regulations may modify the replaceable rules in relation to:

                     (a)  a specified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation; or

                     (b)  a specified class of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may:

                     (a)  modify or repeal the replaceable rules; and

                     (b)  set out new replaceable rules.

### Division 63—What are the internal governance rules of a corporation?

##### <a id="63‑1"></a>63‑1  Meaning of internal governance rules

                   The following constitute the **_internal governance rules_** of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation:

                     (a)  the replaceable rules (if any) applying to the corporation;

                     (b)  the rules (if any) in the corporation’s constitution that modify or replace some or all of the replaceable rules;

                     (c)  the other rules dealing with the internal governance of the corporation that are in the corporation’s constitution.

### Division 66—What are the internal governance rules requirements?

##### <a id="66‑1"></a>66‑1  Requirements

             (1)  The following are the **_internal governance rules requirements_** for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation.

             (2)  The corporation must have a constitution written in English that sets out the corporation’s objects.

             (3)  The corporation’s constitution must cover the matters that this Act specifies must be covered in the corporation’s constitution.

          (3A)  The corporation’s constitution must provide for the resolution of disputes internal to the operation of the corporation.

             (4)  The internal governance rules must cover the matters that are provided for in the replaceable rules (see section 66‑5).

             (5)  The internal governance rules must also be:

                     (a)  internally consistent; and

                     (b)  adequate and workable, given the context in which the corporation operates; and

                     (c)  consistent with this Act; and

                     (d)  consistent with the Native Title legislation if:

                              (i)  an application for registration of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation seeks registration of the corporation for the purpose of becoming a registered native title body corporate; or

                             (ii)  the corporation is a registered native title body corporate.

             (6)  The corporation must meet the requirements at all times after registration.

Note 1:       An application for registration of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation may not be successful unless the corporation, on registration, is complying with the requirements (see section 29‑20).

Note 2:       If an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is making a change to its constitution and the Registrar is of the opinion that the corporation’s internal governance rules, after the change, would not comply with the internal governance rules requirements, the Registrar may refuse to register the change (see section 69‑30).

##### <a id="66‑5"></a>66‑5  Meaning of _cover the matters provided for in the replaceable rules_

If all replaceable rules apply or all are replaced

             (1)  The internal governance rules of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation **_cover the matters provided for in the replaceable rules_** if:

                     (a)  all of the replaceable rules apply to the corporation; or

                     (b)  none of the replaceable rules apply to the corporation and the corporation’s constitution covers all of the matters provided for in the replaceable rules.

If some replaceable rules apply and some are modified or replaced

             (2)  The internal governance rules of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation also **_cover the matters provided for in the replaceable rules_** if:

                     (a)  some of the replaceable rules apply to the corporation; and

                     (b)  the corporation’s constitution provides for the matters covered by the replaceable rules that the corporation has modified or replaced.

Corporation may also have other rules unrelated to the replaceable rules in its constitution

             (3)  To avoid doubt, and subject to the internal governance rules requirements, nothing in this Part  precludes the constitution of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation providing for a matter that is in addition to those matters provided for in the replaceable rules.

Regulations may modify section

             (4)  The regulations may modify this section.

             (5)  Without limiting subsection (4), the regulations may provide for further situations in which the internal governance rules of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation **_cover the matters provided for in the replaceable rules_**.

### Division 69—Constitutions and amendment and replacement of constitutions

#### Subdivision 69‑A—Constitution on registration

##### <a id="69‑1"></a>69‑1  Constitution of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation

             (1)  The constitution of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is the constitution that is registered in respect of the corporation.

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  a member, former member, or person entitled to be registered as a member of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation or of a related body corporate; or

                            (iii)  the Registrar; and

                     (b)  acting with leave granted under section 169‑5;

may:

                     (c)  bring proceedings on behalf of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation; or

                     (d)  intervene in any proceedings to which an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is a party for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the corporation for those proceedings, or for a particular step in those proceedings (for example, compromising or settling them).

             (2)  Proceedings brought on behalf of the corporation must be brought in the corporation’s name.

             (3)  Any right a person may have otherwise had at general law to bring, or intervene in, proceedings on behalf of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is abolished.

Note:          This section does not prevent a person bringing, or intervening in, proceedings on the person’s own behalf in respect of a personal right.

##### <a id="169‑5"></a>169‑5  Applying for and granting leave

Who may apply for leave?

             (1)  A person referred to in paragraph 169‑1(1)(a) may apply to the Court for leave to bring, or to intervene in, proceedings.

Court to grant the application in certain circumstances

             (2)  The Court must grant the application if it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  it is probable that the corporation will not itself bring the proceedings, or properly take responsibility for them, or for the steps in them; and

                     (b)  the applicant is acting in good faith; and

                     (c)  it is in the best interests of the corporation that the applicant be granted leave; and

                     (d)  if the applicant is applying for leave to bring proceedings—there is a serious question to be tried; and

                     (e)  either:

                              (i)  at least 14 days before making the application, the applicant gave written notice to the corporation of the intention to apply for leave and of the reasons for applying; or

                             (ii)  it is appropriate to grant leave even though subparagraph (i) is not satisfied.

This subsection has effect subject to subsections (3) and (5).

When leave is not in the best interests of the corporation

             (3)  A rebuttable presumption that granting leave is not in the best interests of the corporation arises if it is established that:

                     (a)  the proceedings are:

                              (i)  by the corporation against a person who is not a related party of the corporation; or

                             (ii)  by such a person against the corporation;

                            (including any appeal from a decision made in proceedings by or against the corporation); and

                     (b)  the corporation has decided:

                              (i)  not to bring the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  not to defend the proceedings; or

                            (iii)  to discontinue, settle or compromise the proceedings; and

                     (c)  all of the directors who participated in that decision:

                              (i)  acted in good faith for a proper purpose; and

                             (ii)  did not have a material personal interest in the decision; and

                            (iii)  informed themselves about the subject matter of the decision to the extent they reasonably believed to be appropriate; and

                            (iv)  rationally believed that the decision was in the best interests of the corporation.

Note:          **_Related party_** is defined in section 293‑1.

             (4)  A director’s belief that the decision was in the best interests of the corporation is a rational one unless the belief is one that no reasonable person in his or her position would hold.

Decision taken to give effect to Native Title legislation obligation

             (5)  The Court must not grant the application if:

                     (a)  the corporation has decided:

                              (i)  not to bring the proceedings; or

                             (ii)  not to defend the proceedings; or

                            (iii)  to discontinue, settle or compromise the proceedings; and

                     (b)  an officer or employee of the corporation made that decision:

                              (i)  in good faith; and

                             (ii)  with the belief that making the decision was necessary to ensure that the corporation complies with a Native Title legislation obligation.

                     (b)  an officer, or former officer of the corporation;

                     (c)  the Registrar.

When may Court make order

             (2)  The Court may make the order if it is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the applicant is acting in good faith; and

                     (b)  it is appropriate to make the order in all the circumstances.

             (3)  An order substituting one person for another has the effect that:

                     (a)  the grant of leave is taken to have been made in favour of the substituted person; and

                     (b)  if the other person has already brought the proceedings or intervened—the substituted person is taken to have brought those proceedings or to have made that intervention.

##### <a id="169‑15"></a>169‑15  Effect of ratification by members

             (1)  If the members of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation ratify or approve conduct, the ratification or approval:

                     (a)  does not prevent a person from bringing or intervening in proceedings with leave under section 169‑5 or from applying for leave under that section; and

                     (b)  does not have the effect that proceedings brought or intervened in with leave under section 169‑5 must be determined in favour of the defendant, or that an application for leave under that section must be refused.

Effect of ratification on court

             (2)  If the members of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation ratify or approve conduct, the Court may take the ratification or approval into account in deciding what order or judgment (including as to damages) to make in:

                     (a)  proceedings brought or intervened in with leave under section 169‑5; or

                     (b)  in relation to an application for leave under that section.

             (3)  In doing this, it must have regard to:

                     (a)  how well‑informed about the conduct the members were when deciding whether to ratify or approve the conduct; and

                     (b)  whether the members who ratified or approved the conduct were acting for proper purposes.

##### <a id="169‑20"></a>169‑20  Leave to discontinue, compromise or settle proceedings brought, or intervened in, with leave

                   Proceedings brought or intervened in with leave must not be discontinued, compromised or settled without the leave of the Court.

##### <a id="169‑25"></a>169‑25  General powers of the Court

Remuneration and expenses for persons appointed under paragraph (1)(d)

             (3)  If the Court appoints a person under paragraph (1)(d):

##### <a id="172‑1"></a>172‑1  Varying and cancelling class rights

If constitution sets out procedure

             (1)  If an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation’s constitution sets out the procedure for varying or cancelling rights of members in a class of members, those rights may be varied or cancelled only in accordance with the procedure. The procedure may be changed only if the procedure itself is complied with.

If constitution does not set out procedure

             (2)  If an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation’s constitution does not set out the procedure for varying or cancelling rights of members in a class of members, those rights may be varied or cancelled only by special resolution of the corporation and:

                     (a)  a requirement under any provision of this Act or other law that requires the lodging in any manner of any return, account, report or other document with, or the giving of notice to, the Registrar of any matter;

# Chapter 11—External administration

## Part 11‑1—Introduction

### Division 482—Introduction

##### <a id="482‑1"></a>482‑1  What this Chapter is about

* * *

This Chapter deals with the various ways in which the management of some or all of the affairs of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation may be assumed by someone other than the directors of the corporation.

There are basically 4 ways in which this can happen:

               (a)     The Registrar may appoint a special administrator for the corporation under Part 11‑2.

              (b)     A receiver, or another controller, of the corporation’s property may be appointed under the provisions of Part 5.2 of the Corporations Act (as applied by Part 11‑3 of this Act).

               (c)     An administrator for the corporation may be appointed under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act (as applied by Part 11‑4 of this Act).

              (d)     The corporation may be wound up on the grounds set out in Part 11‑5 of this Act (with the winding up being carried out under Chapter 5 of the Corporations Act as applied by Part 11‑5 of this Act).

The following Parts of this Chapter also apply some other provisions of the Corporations Act to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation:

               (a)     Part 11‑6 applies Divisions 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Part 5.7B of the Corporations Act (which deal with insolvent trading);

              (b)     Part 11‑7 applies Part 5.8A of the Corporations Act (which deals with employee entitlements).

Note:          This subsection has the effect that if a special administrator is appointed and the Registrar determines, as part of that appointment, that the offices of the corporation’s officers are not to be vacated, the subsequent appointment of a replacement special administrator will automatically vacate those offices unless a fresh determination is made under section 496‑5 in relation to the new appointment.

##### <a id="496‑5"></a>496‑5  Registrar may determine that offices not vacated in certain circumstances

             (1)  The Registrar:

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent to which the performance or exercise, or purported performance or exercise, is with the special administrator’s written approval.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (2) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (3)  An offence against subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (4)  Subsection (1) does not remove an officer of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation from his or her office.

                     (a)  a receiver, or a receiver and manager, of property of the corporation; or

                     (b)  an administrator of the corporation appointed under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act;

                     (b)  in good faith and in the ordinary course of the ADI’s banking business; and

                     (c)  after the special administration begins and on or before the day on which the Registrar complies with subsection 493‑1(4) in relation to the special administration.

             (4)  Subsection (2) has effect subject to an order that the Court makes after the purported transaction or dealing.

             (5)  If, because of subsection (2), the transaction or dealing is void, or would be void apart from subsection (4), an officer or employee of the corporation who:

                     (a)  purported to enter into the transaction or dealing on the corporation’s behalf; or

                     (b)  was in any other way, by act or omission, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the transaction or dealing;

                     (b)  Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act (as applied by section 521‑1 of this Act).

Note:          This means that a receiver, or an administrator appointed under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act (as applied by section 521‑1 of this Act), cannot exercise any powers without the approval of the special administrator.

             (7)  Despite subsection (6), this section does not affect the validity of anything that a person who is:

                     (a)  a receiver, or a receiver and manager, of property of the corporation; or

                     (b)  an administrator of the corporation appointed under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act;

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a court finds that a person committed an offence constituted by a contravention of subsection 496‑15(5) (including such an offence that is taken to have been committed because of section 11.2 or 11.2A of the _Criminal Code_); and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation or another person has suffered loss or damage because of the act or omission constituting the offence;

the court may (whether or not it imposes a penalty) order the first‑mentioned person to pay compensation to the corporation or other person, as the case may be, of such amount as the order specifies.

             (2)  An order under subsection (1) may be enforced as if it were a judgment of the court.

             (3)  The power of a court under section 576‑1 to relieve a person from liability as mentioned in that section extends to relieving a person from liability to be ordered under this section to pay compensation.

Note:          There are a number of different ways in which there can be directors who can assume control of the corporation’s affairs when the special administration ends. For example:

(a)           the offices of the directors may not have been vacated when the special administrator was appointed and some or all of those directors may remain in office at the end of the special administration; or

(b)           the special administrator may have exercised his or her power to appoint directors under subsection 499‑5(3) and some or all of the appointees may remain in office at the end of the special administration; or

(c)           persons may, at a general meeting of the members of the corporation called by the special administrator under section 508‑5, have been elected as directors to assume control of the corporation’s affairs when the special administration ends.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the corporation is to cease to be under special administration because a liquidator for the corporation is appointed; or

             (1)  The special administrator for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation may conduct an election to elect directors to assume control of the corporation’s affairs immediately after the corporation ceases to be under special administration.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), the election may be conducted:

                     (a)  at a general meeting of the members of the corporation; or

                     (b)  by postal ballot.

             (3)  A person may be elected as a director under this section if the person gives the corporation a signed consent to act as a director of the corporation before being elected.

             (1)  The special administrator for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is to receive such remuneration (if any) as the Registrar determines in writing.

             (2)  A determination under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the special administrator’s remuneration, charges and expenses are to be borne by the Commonwealth.

             (4)  The Registrar:

                     (a)  may determine, in writing, that some or all of the special administrator’s remuneration, charges or expenses are to be borne by the corporation or a related body corporate; and

                     (b)  may charge some or all of the remuneration, charges or expenses referred to in paragraph (a) on the property of the corporation or a related body corporate in such order of priority in relation to any existing charges on that property as the Registrar thinks fit.

             (5)  This section does not apply to a special administrator who is an APS employee or a Commonwealth officer.

          (5A)  Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to a charge created in accordance with paragraph (4)(b).

Note 1:       The effect of this subsection is that the priority between a charge created in accordance with paragraph (4)(b) and a security interest to which the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies is to be determined in accordance with this Act rather than the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_.

Note 2:       Subsection 73(2) of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ applies to charges that arise after the commencement of subsection (5A) (which is the registration commencement time within the meaning of the _Personal Property Securities Act 2009_).

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="commonwealth-offic"></a>**_Commonwealth officer_** includes a person who:

                     (a)  is in the service or employment of the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  holds or performs the duties of any office or position under a law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (c)  is a member of the Australian Defence Force.

Note:          Although section 526‑35 applies the provisions of Part 5.7B to the winding up of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation, the insolvent trading provisions are capable of applying independently of there being a winding up. This section ensures, for example, that a director of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation commits an offence if the corporation trades while insolvent (regardless of whether winding up proceedings are ever commenced).

                     (b)  the director’s duty in relation to the corporation under section 588G of the Corporations Act as applied by section 531‑1 of this Act;

the director’s duty under section 588G of the Corporations Act as so applied prevails, and the director is released from the first‑mentioned duty, to the extent of the conflict.

             (2)  The corporation is released from the duty to comply with its Native Title legislation obligations to the extent that complying with them would place a director of the corporation in breach of his or her duty in relation to the corporation under section 588G of the Corporations Act as so applied.

                     (a)  an application is made under section 23‑1 to register an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation (the **_amalgamated corporation_**) under Part 2‑3 to replace 2 or more existing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations (the **_amalgamating corporations_**); and

                     (b)  the Registrar registers the amalgamated corporation as a result of the application;

the Registrar must deregister the amalgamating corporations.

             (4)  Subsections 546‑20(2) to (7) and sections 546‑25 to 546‑40 do not apply to the deregistration of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation under subsection (3) of this section.

##### <a id="546‑15"></a>546‑15  Registered native title body corporate

                   The Registrar must not deregister an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation that is a registered native title body corporate under section 546‑1, 546‑5 or 546‑10.

##### <a id="546‑20"></a>546‑20  Effect of deregistration

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation ceases to exist

             (1)  An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation ceases to exist on deregistration.

Note:          Despite the deregistration, officers of the corporation may still be liable for things done before the corporation was deregistered.

Corporation’s property vests in Registrar

             (2)  On deregistration, all the corporation’s property vests in the Registrar. If corporation property is vested in a liquidator immediately before deregistration, that property vests in the Registrar. This subsection extends to property situated outside Australia.

             (3)  Under subsection (2), the Registrar takes only the same property rights that the corporation itself held. If the corporation held particular property subject to a security or other interest or claim, the Registrar takes the property subject to that interest or claim.

Note:          See also subsection 546‑25(3), which deals with liabilities that a law imposes on the property (particularly liabilities such as rates, taxes and other charges).

             (4)  The Registrar has all the powers of an owner over property vested in the Registrar under subsection (2).

Note:          Section 546‑30 confers additional powers on the Registrar to fulfil outstanding obligations of the deregistered corporation.

Corporation’s books to be kept by former directors

             (5)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is deregistered; and

                     (b)  the person is a director of the corporation immediately before deregistration; and

                     (c)  the person does not keep the corporation’s books for 3 years after the deregistration.

                    Penalty:  5 penalty units.

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not apply to books that a liquidator has to keep under subsection 542(2) of the Corporations Act (as applied by section 526‑35 of this Act).

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (6) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

Strict liability offences

             (7)  An offence based on subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### <a id="546‑25"></a>546‑25  What the Registrar does with the property

             (1)  If property vested in the Registrar under subsection 546‑20(2) was held by the corporation on trust, the Registrar may:

                     (a)  continue to act as trustee; or

                     (b)  apply to a court for the appointment of a new trustee.

Note:          Under paragraph (a), the Registrar may be able to transfer the property to a new trustee chosen in accordance with the trust instrument.

             (2)  If the corporation did not hold the property on trust, the Registrar may:

                     (a)  dispose of or deal with the property as he or she sees fit; and

                     (b)  apply any money he or she receives to:

                              (i)  defray expenses incurred by the Registrar in exercising his or her powers in relation to the corporation under this Chapter; and

                             (ii)  make payments authorised by subsection (3).

The Registrar must deal with the rest of the property (if any) under Part 12‑3.

Obligations attaching to property

             (3)  The property remains subject to all liabilities imposed on the property under a law and does not have the benefit of any exemption that the property might otherwise have because it is vested in the Registrar. These liabilities include a liability that:

                     (a)  is a charge or claim on the property; and

                     (b)  arises under a law that imposes rates, taxes or other charges.

             (4)  The Registrar’s obligation under subsection (3) is limited to satisfying the liabilities out of the corporation’s property to the extent that the property is properly available to satisfy those liabilities.

Accounts

             (5)  The Registrar must keep:

                     (a)  a record of property that he or she knows is vested in the Registrar under this Part; and

                     (b)  a record of his or her dealings with that property; and

                     (c)  accounts of all money received from those dealings; and

                     (d)  all accounts, vouchers, receipts and papers relating to the property and that money.

##### <a id="546‑30"></a>546‑30  Registrar’s power to fulfil outstanding obligations of deregistered corporation

                   The Registrar may do an act on behalf of the corporation or its liquidator if the Registrar is satisfied that the corporation or liquidator would be bound to do the act if the corporation still existed.

Note:          This power is a general one and is not limited to acts in relation to property vested in the Registrar under subsection 546‑20(2). The Registrar has all the powers that automatically flow from the vesting of property in the Registrar under that subsection (see subsection 546‑20(4)) and may exercise those powers whether or not the corporation was bound to do so.

##### <a id="546‑35"></a>546‑35  Claims against insurers of deregistered corporation

                   A person may recover from the insurer of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation that is deregistered an amount that was payable to the corporation under the insurance contract if:

                     (a)  the corporation had a liability to the person; and

                     (b)  the insurance contract covered that liability immediately before deregistration.

##### <a id="546‑40"></a>546‑40  Reinstatement

Reinstatement by the Registrar

             (1)  The Registrar may reinstate the registration of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation if the Registrar is satisfied that the corporation should not have been deregistered.

Reinstatement by Court

             (2)  The Court may make an order that the Registrar reinstate the registration of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation if:

                     (a)  an application for reinstatement is made to the Court by:

                              (i)  a person aggrieved by the deregistration; or

                             (ii)  a former liquidator of the corporation; and

                     (b)  the Court is satisfied that it is just that the corporation’s registration be reinstated.

             (3)  If the Court makes an order under subsection (2), it may:

                     (a)  validate anything done between the deregistration of the corporation and its reinstatement; and

                     (b)  make any other order it considers appropriate.

Note:          For example, the Court may direct the Registrar to transfer to another person property vested in the Registrar under subsection 546‑20(2).

Registrar to give notice of reinstatement

             (4)  The Registrar must give notice of a reinstatement in the _Gazette_. If the Registrar exercises his or her power under subsection (1) in response to an application by a person, the Registrar must also give notice of the reinstatement to the applicant.

Effect of reinstatement

             (5)  If an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is reinstated:

                     (a)  the corporation is taken to have continued in existence as if it had not been deregistered; and

                     (b)  a person who was a director of the corporation immediately before deregistration becomes a director again as from the time when the Registrar or the Court reinstates the corporation; and

                     (c)  any property of the corporation that is still vested in the Registrar revests in the corporation; and

                     (d)  if the corporation held particular property subject to a security or other interest or claim—the corporation takes the property subject to that interest or claim.

##### <a id="546‑45"></a>546‑45  Regulations may modify Division in relation to statutory Indigenous land trusts

             (1)  The regulations may modify any of the provisions of this Division (other than section 546‑15 and subsection (2) of this section) as they relate to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation that holds land for the benefit of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders under:

                     (a)  the _Aboriginal Land Act 1991_ of Queensland; or

                     (b)  any other law prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

## Part 13‑2—General matters relating to offences

### Division 566—General matters relating to offences

##### <a id="566‑1"></a>566‑1  Penalties for bodies corporate

                   If a body corporate is convicted of an offence against this Act, the penalty that the court may impose is a fine not exceeding 5 times the maximum amount that, but for this section, the court could impose as a pecuniary penalty for that offence.

##### <a id="566‑5"></a>566‑5  Penalty notices

             (1)  If the Registrar has reason to believe that a person has committed a prescribed offence, the Registrar may, subject to subsection (3), give the person a written notice:

                     (a)  alleging that the person has committed the prescribed offence and giving the prescribed particulars in relation to the prescribed offence; and

                     (b)  setting out the prescribed penalty in respect of the prescribed offence; and

                     (c)  in the case of a prescribed offence constituted by a failure to do a particular act or thing—stating:

                              (i)  that the obligation to do the act or thing continues despite the service of the notice or the payment of the prescribed penalty; and

                             (ii)  that if, within the period specified in the notice (being a period of at least 21 days), the person pays the prescribed penalty to the Registrar and does the act or thing, no further action will be taken against the person in relation to the prescribed offence; and

                            (iii)  that if, at the end of the period specified in the notice, the person has not paid the prescribed penalty to the Registrar or has not done the act or thing, proceedings may be instituted against the person; and

                     (d)  in the case of a prescribed offence that is not constituted by a failure to do a particular act or thing—stating:

                              (i)  that if, within the period specified in the notice (being a period of at least 21 days), the person pays the prescribed penalty to the Registrar, no further action will be taken against the person in relation to the prescribed offence; and

                             (ii)  that if, at the end of the period specified in the notice, the person has not paid the prescribed penalty to the Registrar, proceedings may be instituted against the person.

             (2)  A notice under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not empower the Registrar:

                     (a)  to give a person more than one notice under that subsection in relation to an alleged commission by that person of a particular prescribed offence; or

                     (b)  to give a person a notice under that subsection in relation to a prescribed offence unless proceedings could be instituted against that person for that offence in accordance with section 566‑15.

             (4)  A notice under subsection (1) may be given to a natural person either personally or by post.

             (5)  If a notice under subsection (1) is given to a person in relation to a prescribed offence constituted by a failure to do a particular act or thing:

                     (a)  if, within the period specified in the notice, the person pays the prescribed penalty to the Registrar, and does the act or thing—no proceedings may be instituted against the person in respect of the prescribed offence; or

                     (b)  if, at the end of the period specified in the notice, the person has paid the prescribed penalty to the Registrar but has not done the act or thing—no proceedings may be instituted against the person in respect of the prescribed offence, but the obligation to do that act or thing continues, and section 566‑10 applies in relation to the continued failure to do that act or thing as if, on the day on which the person so paid the prescribed penalty, the person had been convicted of an offence constituted by a failure to do that act or thing; or

                     (c)  if, at the end of the period specified in the notice, the person has not paid the prescribed penalty to the Registrar but had done the act or thing—proceedings may be instituted against the person in respect of the prescribed offence; or

                     (d)  if, at the end of the period specified in the notice, the person has not paid the prescribed penalty to the Registrar and has not done the act or thing—the obligation to do that act or thing continues, and proceedings may be instituted against the person in respect of the prescribed offence.

             (6)  If a notice under subsection (1) is given to a person in relation to a prescribed offence, not being an offence constituted by a failure to do a particular act or thing:

                     (a)  if, within the period specified in the notice, the person pays the prescribed penalty to the Registrar—no proceedings may be instituted against the person in respect of the prescribed offence; or

and may make such consequential or ancillary orders as the Court thinks fit.

the Court may, on the application of the Registrar, or of a person whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the conduct, grant an injunction, on such terms as the Court thinks appropriate, restraining the first‑mentioned person from engaging in the conduct and, if in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, requiring that person to do any act or thing.

             (2)  If a person has refused or failed, is refusing or failing, or is proposing to refuse or fail, to do an act or thing that the person is required by this Act to do, the Court may, on the application of:

                     (a)  the Registrar; or

                     (b)  any person whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the refusal or failure to do that act or thing;

grant an injunction, on such terms as the Court thinks appropriate, requiring the first‑mentioned person to do that act or thing.

             (3)  If an application for an injunction under subsection (1) or (2) has been made, the Court may, if the Court determines it to be appropriate, grant an injunction by consent of all the parties to the proceedings, whether or not the Court is satisfied that that subsection applies.

             (4)  If in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, the Court may grant an interim injunction pending determination of an application under subsection (1).

             (5)  The Court may discharge or vary an injunction granted under subsection (1), (2) or (4).

             (6)  The power of the Court to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised:

                     (a)  whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind; and

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and

                     (c)  whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first‑mentioned person engages in conduct of that kind.

             (7)  The power of the Court to grant an injunction requiring a person to do an act or thing may be exercised:

                     (a)  whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do that act or thing; and

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously refused or failed to do that act or thing; and

                     (c)  whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first‑mentioned person refuses or fails to do that act or thing.

             (8)  If the Registrar applies to the Court for the grant of an injunction under this section, the Court must not require the applicant or any other person, as a condition of granting an interim injunction, to give an undertaking as to damages.

             (9)  In proceedings under this section against a person the Court may make an order under section 576‑20 in respect of the person.

           (10)  If the Court has power under this section to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in particular conduct, or requiring a person to do a particular act or thing, the Court may, either in addition to or in substitution for the grant of the injunction, order that person to pay damages to any other person.

##### <a id="576‑30"></a>576‑30  Effect of sections 576‑20 and 576‑25

                   Nothing in either of sections 576‑20 or 576‑25 limits the generality of anything else in either of those sections.

##### <a id="576‑35"></a>576‑35  Power of Court to punish for contempt of Court

                   Nothing in a provision of this Act that provides:

                     (a)  that a person must not contravene an order of the Court; or

                     (b)  that a person who contravenes an order of the Court contravenes a provision of this Act or commits an offence;

affects the powers of the Court in relation to the punishment of contempts of the Court.

## Part 14‑2—Proceedings

### Division 581—Proceedings

##### <a id="581‑1"></a>581‑1  The Registrar’s power to intervene in proceedings

             (1)  The Registrar may intervene in any proceeding relating to a matter arising under this Act.

             (2)  If the Registrar intervenes in a proceeding referred to in subsection (1), the Registrar is taken to be a party to the proceeding and, subject to this Act, has all the rights, duties and liabilities of such a party.

             (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), the Registrar may appear and be represented in any proceeding in which the Registrar wishes to intervene pursuant to subsection (1):

                     (a)  by a natural person to whom, or by an officer or employee of a person or body to whom or to which, the Registrar has delegated its functions and powers under this Act or such of those functions and powers as relate to a matter to which the proceeding relates; or

                     (b)  by solicitor or counsel.

##### <a id="581‑5"></a>581‑5  Civil proceedings not to be stayed

                   No civil proceedings under this Act are to be stayed merely because the proceeding discloses, or arises out of, the commission of an offence.

##### <a id="581‑10"></a>581‑10  Standard of proof

                   If, in proceedings other than proceedings for an offence, it is necessary to establish, or for the Court to be satisfied, for any purpose relating to a matter arising under this Act, that:

                     (a)  a person has contravened a provision of this Act; or

                     (b)  default has been made in complying with a provision of this Act; or

                     (c)  an act or omission was unlawful because a provision of this Act; or

                     (d)  a person has been in any way, by act or omission, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in or party to a contravention, or a default in complying with, a provision of this Act;

it is sufficient if the matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) is established, or the Court is so satisfied, as the case may be, on the balance of probabilities.

##### <a id="581‑15"></a>581‑15  Evidence of contravention

                   For the purposes of this Act, a certificate that:

                     (a)  purports to be signed by the Registrar of an Australian court or other proper officer of an Australian court; and

                     (b)  states:

                              (i)  that a person was convicted by that court on a specified day of a specified offence; or

                             (ii)  that a person charged before that court with a specified offence was, on a specified day, found in that court to have committed the offence but that the court did not proceed to convict the person of the offence;

is, unless it is proved that the conviction was quashed or set aside, or that the finding was set aside or reversed, as the case may be, conclusive evidence:

                     (c)  if subparagraph (b)(i) applies—that the person was convicted of the offence on that day; and

                     (d)  if the offence was constituted by a contravention of a provision of a law—that the person contravened that provision.

##### <a id="581‑20"></a>581‑20  Costs

             (1)  If an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding, the court having jurisdiction in the matter may, if it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his, her or its defence, require sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security is given.

             (2)  The costs of any proceeding before a court under this Act are to be borne by such party to the proceeding as the court, in its discretion, directs.

##### <a id="581‑25"></a>581‑25  Vesting of property

             (1)  If an order is made by a court under this Act vesting property in a person:

                     (a)  subject to subsection (2), the property forthwith vests in the person named in the order without any conveyance, transfer or assignment; and

                     (b)  the person who applied for the order must, within 7 days after the passing and entering of the order, lodge an office copy of the order with such person (if any) as is specified for the purpose in the order.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the property to which an order referred to in subsection (1) relates is property the transfer or transmission of which may be registered under a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory; and

                     (b)  that law enables the registration of such an order;

the property, despite that it vests in equity in the person named in the order, does not vest in that person at law until the requirements of the law referred to in paragraph (a) have been complied with.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  property vests in a person by force of this Act; and

                     (b)  the property is property the transfer or transmission of which may be registered under a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory; and

                     (c)  that law enables the person to be registered as the owner of that property;

the property, despite that it vests in equity in that person by force of this Act, does not vest in that person at law until the requirements of the law referred to in paragraph (b) have been complied with.

             (1)  This Division deals with:

                     (a)  the jurisdiction of courts in respect of civil matters arising under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation; and

                     (b)  the jurisdiction of courts in respect of matters arising under the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_ involving or related to decisions made under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation by Commonwealth authorities and officers of the Commonwealth; and

                     (c)  the jurisdiction of courts in civil matters in respect of decisions made by officers of the Commonwealth to prosecute persons for offences against the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation and related criminal justice process decisions.

             (2)  Subject to section 9 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_, jurisdiction is conferred on the Supreme Court of:

                     (a)  each State; and

                     (b)  the Australian Capital Territory; and

                     (c)  the Northern Territory;

with respect to civil matters arising under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation.

                     (b)  the Australian Capital Territory; and

                     (c)  the Northern Territory;

with respect to matters arising under that Act involving or related to decisions made, or proposed or required to be made, under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation by a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth.

Note 1:       The Federal Court also has jurisdiction with respect to these matters under that Act.

Note 2:       A Supreme Court may be required to transfer a proceeding with respect to such a matter to the Federal Court (see subsection 586‑35(3)).

             (4)  Subsection (3) applies to a decision made, or proposed or required to be made:

                     (a)  whether or not in the exercise of a discretion; and

                     (b)  whether before or after that subsection commences.

             (5)  The jurisdiction conferred on a Supreme Court by subsection (2) or (3) is not limited by any limits to which any other jurisdiction of that Supreme Court may be subject.

             (6)  This section has effect subject to section 586‑15.

##### <a id="586‑10"></a>586‑10  Jurisdiction of Family Court and State Family Courts

             (1)  Jurisdiction is conferred on the Family Court with respect to civil matters arising under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation.

             (2)  Subject to section 9 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_, jurisdiction is conferred on each State Family Court with respect to civil matters arising under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation.

             (3)  The jurisdiction conferred on a State Family Court by subsection (2) is not limited by any limits to which any other jurisdiction of the State Family Court may be subject.

             (4)  This section has effect subject to section 586‑15.

##### <a id="586‑15"></a>586‑15  Jurisdiction of courts (decisions to prosecute and related criminal justice process decisions made by Commonwealth officers)

             (1)  If a decision to prosecute a person for an offence against the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation has been made by an officer or officers of the Commonwealth and the prosecution is proposed to be commenced in a State or Territory court:

                     (a)  neither the Federal Court nor the Family Court has jurisdiction with respect to any matter in which a person seeks a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction against the officer or officers in relation to that decision; and

                     (b)  jurisdiction with respect to any such matter is conferred on the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the prosecution is proposed to be commenced.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), at any time when:

                     (a)  a prosecution for an offence against the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation is before a State or Territory court; or

                     (b)  an appeal arising out of such a prosecution is before a State or Territory court;

the following apply:

                     (c)  neither the Federal Court nor the Family Court has jurisdiction with respect to any matter in which the person who is or was the defendant in the prosecution seeks a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction against an officer or officers of the Commonwealth in relation to a related criminal justice process decision;

                     (d)  jurisdiction with respect to any such matter is conferred on the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the prosecution or appeal is before a court.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply where a person has applied for a writ of mandamus or prohibition, or an injunction, against an officer or officers of the Commonwealth in relation to a related criminal justice process decision before the commencement of a prosecution for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or a Territory.

             (4)  If subsection (3) applies, the prosecutor may apply to the court for a permanent stay of the proceedings referred to in that subsection and the court may grant such a stay if the court determines that:

                     (a)  the matters that are the subject of the proceedings are more appropriately dealt with in the criminal justice process; and

                     (b)  a stay of proceedings will not substantially prejudice the person.

             (5)  Subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) have effect despite anything in this Act or in any other law. In particular:

                     (a)  neither this Act, nor any other law, has the effect of giving the Federal Court or the Family Court jurisdiction contrary to subsection (1) or (2); and

                     (b)  neither section 9 of the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_, nor any other law, has the effect of removing from the Supreme Court of a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory the jurisdiction given to that Court by subsection (1) or (2).

                     (c)  a decision in connection with the issue of a warrant, including a search warrant or a seizure warrant; and

                     (d)  a decision requiring the production of documents, the giving of information or the summoning of persons as witnesses; and

                     (a)  a State or Territory court; or

             (2)  An appeal may not be instituted from a decision of a court of the Australian Capital Territory to:

                     (a)  a court of a State or the Northern Territory; or

                     (b)  the Family Court.

             (3)  An appeal may not be instituted from a decision of a court (not being a State Family Court) of a State or the Northern Territory to:

                     (b)  a court of another State or Territory; or

                     (c)  the Family Court; or

                   All courts having jurisdiction in:

                     (a)  civil matters arising under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation; or

                     (b)  matters referred to in subsection 586‑5(3);

and the officers of, or under the control of, those courts must severally act in aid of, and be auxiliary to, each other in all those matters.

#### Subdivision 586‑C—Transfer of proceedings

##### <a id="586‑35"></a>586‑35  Transfer of proceedings by the Federal Court and State and Territory Supreme Courts

             (1)  This section applies to a proceeding (the **_relevant proceeding_**) in a court (the **_transferor court_**) if:

                     (a)  the relevant proceeding is:

                              (i)  a proceeding with respect to a civil matter arising under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation; or

                             (ii)  a subsection 586‑5(3) proceeding; and

                     (b)  the transferor court is:

                              (i)  the Federal court; or

                             (ii)  a State or Territory Supreme Court.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5), if it appears to the transferor court that, having regard to the interests of justice, it is more appropriate for:

                     (a)  the relevant proceeding; or

                     (b)  an application in the relevant proceeding;

to be determined by another court that has jurisdiction in the matters for determination in the relevant proceeding or application, the transferor court may transfer the relevant proceeding or application to that other court.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the relevant proceeding is a subsection 586‑5(3) proceeding; and

                     (b)  the transferor court is a State or Territory Supreme Court;

the transferor court must transfer the relevant proceeding to the Federal Court unless the matter for determination in it arises out of, or relates to, another proceeding pending in any court of that State or Territory that:

                     (c)  arises, or a substantial part of which arises, under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation; and

                     (d)  is not a subsection 586‑5(3) proceeding;

regardless of which proceeding was commenced first.

             (4)  Even if subsection (3) does not require a State or Territory Supreme Court to transfer a subsection 586‑5(3) proceeding to the Federal Court, it may nevertheless do so if it considers that to be appropriate, having regard to the interests of justice, including the desirability of related proceedings being heard in the same State or Territory.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the relevant proceeding is a subsection 586‑5(3) proceeding in relation to a matter; and

                     (b)  the transferor court is the Federal Court;

the transferor court may only transfer the relevant proceeding, or an application in the relevant proceeding, to a State or Territory Supreme Court if:

                     (c)  the matter arises out of, or relates to, another proceeding pending in any court of that State or Territory that:

                              (i)  arises, or a substantial part of which arises, under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation; and

                             (ii)  is not a subsection 586‑5(3) proceeding;

                            regardless of which proceeding was commenced first; and

                     (d)  the transferor court considers the transfer to be appropriate, having regard to the interests of justice, including the desirability of related proceedings being heard in the same jurisdiction.

             (6)  Nothing in this section confers on a court jurisdiction that the court would not otherwise have.

             (7)  The fact that some references in this section to the interests of justice include the desirability of related proceedings being heard in the same jurisdiction does not of itself mean that other references to the interests of justice, in this section or elsewhere in this Act, do not include that matter.

##### <a id="586‑40"></a>586‑40  Transfer of proceedings by Family Court and State Family Courts

             (1)  This section applies to a proceeding (the **_relevant proceeding_**) in a court (the **_transferor court)_** if:

                     (a)  the relevant proceeding is with respect to a civil matter arising under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations legislation; and

                     (b)  the transferor court is:

                              (i)  the Family Court of Australia; or

                             (ii)  a State Family Court.

             (2)  If it appears to the transferor court:

                     (a)  that the relevant proceeding arises out of, or is related to, another proceeding pending in:

                              (i)  the Federal Court; or

                             (ii)  another State or Territory court;

                            and that the court in which the other proceeding is pending is the most appropriate court to determine the relevant proceeding; or

                     (b)  that having regard to:

                              (i)  whether, in the transferor court’s opinion, apart from this Division, the relevant proceeding, or a substantial part of it, would have been incapable of being instituted in the transferor court; and

                             (ii)  the extent to which, in the transferor court’s opinion, the matters for determination in the relevant proceeding are matters not within the transferor court’s jurisdiction apart from this Division; and

                            (iii)  the interests of justice;

                            the Federal Court, or another State or Territory court, is the most appropriate court to determine the relevant proceeding; or

                     (c)  that it is otherwise in the interests of justice that the Federal Court, or another State or Territory court, determine the relevant proceeding;

the transferor court must transfer the relevant proceeding to the Federal Court or to that other court.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (2), if it appears to the transferor court:

                     (a)  that the relevant proceeding arises out of, or is related to, another proceeding pending in another court that is:

                              (i)  the Family Court of Australia; or

                             (ii)  a State Family Court;

                            and that has jurisdiction under section 586‑10 in the matters for determination in the relevant proceeding and that the other court is the most appropriate court to determine the relevant proceeding; or

                     (b)  that it is otherwise in the interests of justice that the relevant proceeding be determined by another court that is:

                              (i)  the Family Court of Australia; or

                             (ii)  a State Family Court;

                            and that has jurisdiction under section 586‑10 in the matters for determination in the relevant proceeding;

the transferor court must transfer the relevant proceeding to the other court.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the transferor court transfers the relevant proceeding to another court; and

                     (b)  the place or places where the events that are the subject of the proceeding or application took place; and

                     (c)  the other courts that have jurisdiction to deal with the proceeding or application.

##### <a id="586‑55"></a>586‑55  Transfer may be made at any stage

                   If, under section 586‑35, 586‑40 or 586‑45, a court (the **_transferor court_**) transfers a proceeding, or an application in a proceeding, to another court:

                     (a)  the Registrar of the transferor court or other proper officer of the transferor court must transmit to the Registrar of the other court or other proper officer of the other court all documents filed in the transferor court in respect of the proceeding or application, as the case may be; and

                     (b)  the other court must proceed as if:

                              (i)  the proceeding had been originally instituted in the other court; and

                             (ii)  the same proceedings had been taken in the other court as were taken in the transferor court; and

                            (iii)  in a case where an application is transferred—the application had been made in the other court.

             (1)  Subject to sections 586‑80, 586‑85 and 586‑90, if it appears to a court that, in determining a matter for determination in a proceeding, the court will, or will be likely to, be exercising jurisdiction to which subsection (3) applies, the rules of evidence and procedure to be applied in dealing with that matter are to be the rules that:

                     (a)  are applied in a superior court in Australia or in an external Territory; and

                     (b)  the court considers appropriate to be applied in the circumstances.

             (2)  If a proceeding is transferred or removed to a court (the **_transferee court_**) from another court (the **_transferor court_**), the transferee court must deal with the proceeding as if, subject to any order of the transferee court, the steps that had been taken for the purposes of the proceeding in the transferor court (including the making of an order), or similar steps, had been taken in the transferee court.

in the transferee court that the person would have if the transferee court were a federal court exercising federal jurisdiction.

                     (b)  a period is specified under this Act for giving notice of the decision to the applicant; and

                     (c)  the Registrar has not notified the applicant of the Registrar’s decision within that period;

the Registrar is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have made a decision to reject the application.

##### <a id="617‑10"></a>617‑10  Notice of reviewable decision and review rights

             (1)  This section applies to a person (the **_decision maker_**) who:

                     (a)  makes a reviewable decision; or

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not require the decision maker to give notice to a person affected by the decision or to the persons in a class of persons affected by the decision, if the decision maker determines that giving notice to the person or persons is not warranted, having regard to:

                     (a)  the cost of giving notice to the person or persons; and

                     (b)  the way in which the interests of the person or persons are affected by the decision.

             (4)  A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the decision.

                     (a)  make a decision affirming, varying or setting aside the reviewable decision; and

                     (b)  if the reviewer sets aside the decision, make such other decision as the reviewer thinks appropriate.

             (6)  The reviewer’s decision (the **_decision on review_**) takes effect:

                     (a)  on the day specified in the decision on review; or

                     (b)  if a day is not specified—on the day on which the decision on review was made.

                              (i)  controls the composition of the first body’s board; or

                             (ii)  is in a position to cast, or control the casting of, more than one‑half of the maximum number of votes that might be cast at a general meeting of the first body; or

Note:          Subparagraph (a)(iii)—although an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation itself does not have shares, the corporation may hold shares in a body corporate that does have shares.

##### <a id="689‑5"></a>689‑5  Control of a body corporate’s board

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, the composition of the board of a body corporate (the **_first body_**) is taken to be controlled by another body (the **_second body_**) if the second body, by exercising a power exercisable (whether with or without the consent or concurrence of any other person) by it, can appoint or remove all, or the majority, of the directors of the first body.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Division, the second body is taken to have power to make such an appointment if:

                     (a)  a person cannot be appointed as a director of the first body without the exercise by the second body of such a power in the person’s favour; or

                     (b)  a person’s appointment as a director of the first body follows necessarily from the person being a director or other officer of the second body.

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not limit the circumstances in which the composition of a body corporate’s board is taken to be controlled by another body corporate.

##### <a id="689‑10"></a>689‑10  Matters to be disregarded

             (1)  This section applies for the purposes of determining whether a body corporate (the **_first body_**) is a subsidiary of another body corporate.

             (2)  Any shares held, or power exercisable, by the other body in a fiduciary capacity are treated as not held or exercisable by it.

             (3)  Subject to subsections (4) and (5), any shares held, or power exercisable:

                     (a)  by a person as a nominee for the other body (except where the other body is concerned only in a fiduciary capacity); or

                     (b)  by, or by a nominee for, a subsidiary of the other body (not being a subsidiary that is concerned only in a fiduciary capacity);

are treated as held or exercisable by the other body.

             (4)  Any shares held, or power exercisable, by a person by virtue of the provisions of debentures of the first body, or of a trust deed for securing an issue of such debentures, are to be disregarded.

             (5)  Any shares held, or power exercisable, otherwise than as mentioned in subsection (4), by, or by a nominee for, the other body or a subsidiary of it are to be treated as not held or exercisable by the other body if:

                     (a)  the ordinary business of the other body or that subsidiary, as the case may be, includes lending money; and

                     (b)  the shares are held, or the power is exercisable, only by way of security given for the purposes of a transaction entered into in the ordinary course of business in connection with lending money, not being a transaction entered into with an associate of the other body, or of that subsidiary, as the case may be.

##### <a id="689‑15"></a>689‑15  References in this Division to a subsidiary

                   A reference in paragraph 689‑1(b) or 689‑10(3)(b) or subsection 689‑10(5) to being a subsidiary, or to a subsidiary, of a body corporate includes a reference to being a subsidiary, or to a body corporate that is a subsidiary, as the case may be, of the first‑mentioned body by virtue of any other application or applications of this Division.

##### <a id="689‑20"></a>689‑20  Related bodies corporate

                   If a body corporate is:

                     (a)  a holding body corporate of another body corporate; or

                     (b)  a subsidiary of another body corporate; or

                     (c)  a subsidiary of a holding body corporate of another body corporate;

the first‑mentioned body and the other body are related to each other.

##### <a id="689‑25"></a>689‑25  Control

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, an entity controls a second entity if the first entity has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the second entity’s financial and operating policies.

             (2)  In determining whether the first entity has this capacity:

                     (a)  the practical influence the first entity can exert (rather than the rights it can enforce) is the issue to be considered; and

                     (b)  any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the second entity’s financial or operating policies is to be taken into account (even if it involves a breach of an agreement or a breach of trust).

             (3)  The first entity does not control the second entity merely because the first entity and a third entity jointly have the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the second entity’s financial and operating policies.

             (4)  If the first entity:

                     (a)  has the capacity to influence decisions about the second entity’s financial and operating policies; and

                     (b)  is under a legal obligation to exercise that capacity for the benefit of someone other than the first entity’s members;

the first entity is taken not to control the second entity.

             (5)  If the first entity is a common law holder of native title and the second entity is a registered native title body corporate, the first entity does not control the second entity merely because the second entity complies with a Native Title legislation obligation.
