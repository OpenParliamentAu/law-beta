## An Act to amend the Corporations Law, and for related purposes

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title etc. [_see_ Note 1]

## 1  Part 1.5, the heading to Chapter 2 and Parts 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4

                   Repeal the Parts and heading, substitute:

## Part 1.5—Small business guide

                   This guide summarises the main rules in the Corporations Law that apply to proprietary companies limited by shares—the most common type of company used by small business. The guide gives a general overview of the Corporations Law as it applies to those companies and directs readers to the operative provisions in the Law.

                   The notes in square brackets at the end of paragraphs in the guide indicate the main provisions of the Corporations Law, the regulations made under the Law, and Australian Securities Commission Practice Notes that are relevant to the information in the paragraphs.

                   Other Commonwealth, State and Territory laws also impose obligations on proprietary companies and their operators.

##### <a id="1"></a>1  What registration means

1.1 Separate legal entity that has its own powers

                   As far as the law is concerned, a company has a separate legal existence that is distinct from that of its owners, managers, operators, employees and agents. A company has its own property, its own rights and its own obligations. A company’s money and other assets belong to the company and must be used for the company’s purposes.

                   A company has the powers of an individual, including the powers to:

                        •  own and dispose of property and other assets

                        •  enter into contracts

                        •  sue and be sued.

                   Once a company is registered, its separate legal status, property, rights and liabilities continue until the ASC (Australian Securities Commission) deregisters the company.

\[sections 119, 124–125, 601AA–601AD]

1.2 Limited liability of shareholders

                   Shareholders of a company are not liable (in their capacity as shareholders) for the company’s debts. As shareholders, their only obligation is to pay the company any amount unpaid on their shares if they are called upon to do so. However, particularly if a shareholder is also a director, this limitation may be affected by other laws and the commercial practices discussed in 1.3 and 1.4.

\[section 516]

1.3 Director’s liability for company’s debts

                   A director of a company may be liable for debts incurred by the company at a time when the company itself is unable to pay those debts as they fall due.

                   A director of a company may be liable to compensate the company for any losses the company suffers from a breach of certain of the director’s duties to the company (see 5.3).

                   In addition to having liability for the company’s debts or to pay compensation to the company, a director may also be subject to a civil penalty.

                   If a company holds property on trust, a director of the company may be liable in some circumstances for liabilities incurred by the company as trustee.

\[sections 232, 233, 344, 588G, 588J, 588M, 1317HA, 1317HD]

1.4 Director’s liability as guarantor/security over personal assets

                   As a matter of commercial practice, a bank, trade creditor or anyone else providing finance or credit to a company may ask a director of the company:

                        •  for a personal guarantee of the company’s liabilities; and

                        •  for some form of security over their house or personal assets to secure the performance by the company of its obligations.

                   The director of a company may, for example, be asked by a bank to give a mortgage over their house to secure the company’s repayment of a loan. If the company does not repay the loan as agreed with the bank, the director may lose the house.

1.5 Continuous existence

                   A company continues to exist even if 1 or more of its shareholders or directors sells their shares, dies or leaves the company. If a company has only 1 shareholder who is also the only director of the company and that person dies, their personal representative is able to ensure that the company continues to operate.

\[sections 119, 224A]

1.6 Rules for the internal management of a company 

                   The Law contains a basic set of rules for the internal management of a company (appointments, meetings etc.).

                   Some of these rules are mandatory for all companies. There are a few special rules for single shareholder/single director companies.

                   Other internal management rules in the Law are replaceable rules. The replaceable rules do not apply to:

                        •  a single shareholder/single director company; or

                        •  a company that had a constitution before the introduction of the replaceable rules regime and has not repealed it.

                   A company does not need to have a separate constitution of its own; it can simply take advantage of the rules in the Law. The company will need a constitution only if it wants to displace, modify or add to the replaceable rules.

\[sections 134–141, 224B]

1.7 How a company acts

                   A company does not have a physical existence. It must act through other people.

                   Individual directors, the company secretary, company employees or agents may be authorised to enter into contracts that bind the company (see 7).

                   In some circumstances, a company will be bound by something done by another person (see 1.8).

1.8 Directors

                   The directors of a company are responsible for managing the company’s business. It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that generally the directors may exercise all the powers of the company except a power that the Law, a replaceable rule or a provision of the company’s constitution (if any) requires the company to exercise in general meeting.

                   The only director of a company who is also the only shareholder is responsible for managing the company’s business and may exercise all of the company’s powers.

                   The Law sets out rules dealing with the calling and conduct of directors’ meetings. Directors must keep a written record (minutes) of their resolutions and meetings.

                   There are 2 ways that directors may pass resolutions:

                        •  at a meeting; or

                        •  by having all of the directors record and sign their decision.

                   If a company has only 1 director, the sole director may also pass a resolution by recording and signing their decision.

\[sections 224B, 226A, 248A–248G, 251A]

1.9 Shareholders

                   The shareholders of a company own the company, but the company has a separate legal existence and the company’s assets belong to the company.

                   Shareholders can make decisions about the company by passing a resolution, usually at a meeting. A “special resolution” usually involves more important questions affecting the company as a whole or the rights of some or all of its shareholders.

                   There are 2 ways that shareholders may pass a resolution:

                        •  at a meeting; or

                        •  by having all of the shareholders record and sign their decision.

                   If a meeting is held, an ordinary resolution must be passed by a majority of the votes cast by shareholders of the company entitled to vote on the resolution at the meeting in person or by proxy (if proxies are allowed). A special resolution must be passed by at least 75% of the votes cast by shareholders of the company entitled to vote on the resolution and who vote at the meeting in person or by proxy (if proxies are allowed).

                   The sole shareholder of a company may pass a resolution by recording and signing their decision.

                   A company must keep a written record (minutes) of the members’ resolutions and meetings.

\[sections 9 (**_special resolution_**), 249A, 249B, 249L, 251A]

1.10 What others can assume about the company 

                   Anyone who does any business with the company is entitled to assume that the company has a legal right to conduct that business unless the person knows, or suspects, otherwise. For example, an outsider dealing with the company is entitled to assume:

                        •  that a person who is shown in a notice lodged with the ASC as being the director or company secretary of a company has been properly appointed and is authorised to act for the company; and

                        •  that a person who is held out by the company to be a director, company secretary or agent of the company has been properly appointed and is authorised to act for the company.

\[sections 128–130]

##### <a id="2"></a>2  The company structure for small business

2.1 Proprietary company for small business

                   Generally, a proprietary company limited by shares is the most suitable company for use by small business. Such a proprietary company must have a least 1 shareholder but no more than 50 shareholders (not counting employee shareholders). It may have 1 or more directors.

\[sections 112–113]

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Setting up a new company

                   The operators of small businesses can either buy “shelf” companies or set up new companies themselves.

3.1 “Shelf” companies

                   The operator of a small business may find it more convenient to buy a “shelf” company (a company that has already been registered but has not traded) from businesses which set up companies for this purpose or from some legal or accounting firms.

3.2 Setting up a company 

                   To set up a new company themselves, the operator must apply to the ASC for registration of the company.

                   A proprietary company limited by shares must have at least 1 shareholder.

                   To obtain registration, a person must lodge a properly completed application form with the ASC. The form must set out certain information including details of every person who has consented to be a shareholder, director or company secretary of the company.

                   The company comes into existence when the ASC registers it.

\[sections 117–119, 135–136, 140]

3.3 ACN and name

                   When a company is registered, the ASC allocates to it a unique 9 digit number called the Australian Company Number (ACN). (For use of the ACN see 4.1).

                   In practice, a new company must have a name that is different from the name of a company that is already registered. A proprietary company limited by shares must have the words “Proprietary Limited” as part of its name. Those words can be abbreviated to “Pty Ltd”. 

                   A proprietary company may adopt its ACN as its name. If it does so, its name must also contain the words “Australian Company Number” (which can be abbreviated to “ACN”). For example, the company’s name might be “ACN 123 456 789 Pty Ltd”.

\[sections 119, 147–161]

3.4 Contracts entered into before the company is registered

                   A company can ratify a contract entered into by someone on its behalf or for its benefit before it was registered. If the company does not ratify the contract, the person who entered into the contract may be personally liable.

\[sections 131–133]

3.5  First shareholders, directors and company secretary

                   A person listed with their consent as a shareholder, director or company secretary in the application for registration of the company becomes a shareholder, director or company secretary of the company on its registration.

                   The same person may be both a director of the company and the company secretary.

                   See 5.1 and 5.2 for directors and 5.4 for company secretaries. See 6.1 for shareholders.

\[section 120]

3.6 Issuing shares

                   It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that, before issuing new shares, a company must first offer them to the existing shareholders in the proportions that the shareholders already hold. A company may issue shares at a price it determines. 

\[sections 254B, 254D]

3.7 Registered office 

                   A company must have a registered office in Australia and must inform the ASC of the location of the office. A post office box cannot be the registered office of a company. The purpose of the registered office is to have a place where all communications and notices to the company may be sent.

                   If the company does not occupy the premises where its registered office is located, the occupier of the premises must agree in writing to having the company’s registered office located there.

                   A proprietary company is not required to open its registered office to the public but this does not affect its obligation to make documents available for inspection.

                   The company must notify the ASC of any change of address of its registered office.

\[sections 100, 142, 143, 173, 1300]

3.8 Principal place of business

                   If a company has a principal place of business that is different to its registered office, it must notify the ASC of the address of its principal place of business and of any changes to that address.

\[sections 117, 146]

3.9 Registers kept by the company

                   A company must keep registers, including a register of shareholders and a register of charges. A company must keep its registers at:

                        •  the company’s registered office; or

                        •  the company’s principal place of business; or

                        •  a place (whether on premises of the company or of someone else) where the work in maintaining the register is done; or

                        •  another place approved by the ASC.

                   A register may be kept either in a bound or looseleaf book or on computer.

                   If a register is kept on computer, its contents must be capable of being printed out in hard copy.

\[sections 172, 1300–1302, 1306]

3.10 Register of shareholders

                   A company must keep in its register of shareholders such information as:

                        •  the names and addresses of its shareholders; and

                        •  details of shares held by individual shareholders.

\[sections 168–169]

3.11 Register of charges

                   A company must keep a register of charges if the company gives a bank, trade creditor or anybody else a charge over company assets.

\[section 271]

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Continuing obligations after the company is set up

                   The Corporations Law and other laws impose obligations on companies themselves and on their directors and company secretaries. Some of the more important obligations imposed under the Corporations Law are discussed below.

4.1 Use of company name and ACN

                   The name of a company must be shown at all the company’s business premises (including its registered office) that are open to the public. The company’s name and its ACN must appear:

                        •  on some of its public documents; and

                        •  on its cheques and negotiable instruments; and

                        •  on all documents lodged with the ASC; and

                        •  if it has one, on its common seal.

\[sections 123, 144, 147–156,
 Australian Securities Commission Practice Note 47]

4.2 Annual return

                   A company must lodge with the ASC an annual return which contains such information as:

                        •  names and addresses of each director and company secretary; and

                        •  issued shares and options granted; and

                        •  details of its shareholders; and

                        •  address of its registered office; and

                        •  address of its principal place of business; and

                        •  a statement that the directors have resolved in the last month that, in the directors’ opinion, there are reasonable grounds to believe the company will be able to pay its debts as and when they become payable (but if the company has lodged an annual financial report with the ASC within the last 12 months, it does not need to include this statement).

                   An annual return may be lodged with the ASC on a printed form or, if an agreement is in place to lodge electronically, in accordance with the agreement.

                   The ASC may send a partially completed annual return to a company that wants to lodge its annual return on a printed form for the company to check, amend if necessary, verify and send back to the ASC. However, a company must lodge an annual return with the ASC even if the ASC does not send a partially completed annual return to the company.

\[sections 345–348, 352]

4.3 Annual fee

                   A company must pay an annual fee to the ASC on lodgment of the annual return.

\[Corporations (Fees) Regulations]

4.4 Notification to ASC of changes

                   The company must notify the ASC if certain basic changes to the company occur. The following table sets out these notification requirements.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Company directors and company secretaries

5.1 Who can be a director

                   Only an individual who is at least 18 years old can be a director. If a company has only 1 director, they must ordinarily reside in Australia. If a company has more than 1 director, at least 1 of the directors must ordinarily reside in Australia.

                   A director must consent in writing to holding the position of director. The company must keep the consent and must notify the ASC of the appointment.

                   In some circumstances, the Corporations Law imposes the duties and obligations of a director on a person who, although not formally appointed as a director of a company, nevertheless acts as a director or gives instructions to the formally appointed directors as to how they should act.

                   The Court or the ASC may prohibit a person from being a director or from otherwise being involved in the management of a company if, for example, the person has breached the Corporations Law.

                   A person needs the Court’s permission to be a director if the person has been convicted of certain offences or is, in some circumstances, unable to pay their debts as they fall due.

                   Generally, a director may resign by giving notice of the resignation to the company. The company must notify the ASC of a director’s resignation. A director who resigns may also notify the ASC of the resignation.

\[sections 60, 221, 222A, 224, 228–230, 242, 242C, 599, 600, 1317EA(3)]

5.2  Appointment of new directors

                   It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that shareholders may appoint directors by resolution at a general meeting.

\[section 224C]

5.3 Duties and liabilities of directors

                   In managing the business of a company (see 1.7), each of its directors is subject to a wide range of duties under the Corporations Law and other laws. Some of the more important duties are:

                        •  to act in good faith

                        •  to act in the best interests of the company

                        •  to avoid conflicts between the interests of the company and the director’s interests

                        •  to act honestly

                        •  to exercise care and diligence

                        •  to prevent the company trading while it is unable to pay its debts

                        •  if the company is being wound up—to report to the liquidator on the affairs of the company

                        •  if the company is being wound up—to help the liquidator (by, for example, giving to the liquidator any records of the company that the director has).

                   A director who fails to perform their duties:

                        •  may be guilty of a criminal offence with a penalty of $200,000 or imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both; and

                        •  may contravene a civil penalty provision (and the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth an amount of up to $200,000); and

                        •  may be personally liable to compensate the company or others for any loss or damage they suffer; and

                        •  may be prohibited from managing a company.

                   A director’s obligations may continue even after the company has been deregistered. 

\[sections 232, 475, 530A, 588G, 596, 601AD, 601AH, 1317FA,
 1317HA, 1317HB, 1317HD]

5.4 Company secretaries

                   A company must have a company secretary. The directors appoint the company secretary. A company secretary must be at least 18 years old. If a company has only 1 company secretary, they must ordinarily reside in Australia. If a company has more than 1 company secretary, at least 1 of them must ordinarily reside in Australia.

                   A company secretary must consent in writing to holding the position of company secretary. The company must keep the consent and must notify the ASC of the appointment.

                   The same person may be both a director of a company and the company secretary.

                   Generally, a company secretary may resign by giving written notice of the resignation to the company. The company must notify the ASC of a company secretary’s resignation. A company secretary who resigns may also notify the ASC of the resignation.

                   The company secretary is an officer of the company and, in that capacity, may be subject to the requirements imposed by the Corporations Law on company officers. The company secretary has specific responsibilities under the Corporations Law, including responsibility for ensuring that the company notifies the ASC about changes to the identities, names and addresses of the company’s directors and company secretaries and that the company lodges its annual return.

                   A company secretary’s obligations may continue even after the company has been deregistered.

\[sections 83, 142, 222A, 240, 242, 242C, 345, 601AD, 601AH]

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Shares and shareholders

                   A proprietary company limited by shares must have a share capital and at least 1 shareholder. The ASC may apply to a Court to have a company wound up if it does not have any shareholders.

\[sections 461– 462]

6.1 Becoming a shareholder and ceasing to be a shareholder

                   A person may become a shareholder of a company in several ways, including the following:

                        •  the person being listed as a shareholder of the company in the application for registration of the company

                        •  the company issuing shares to the person

                        •  the person buying shares in the company from an existing shareholder and the company registering the transfer.

                   Some of the ways in which a person ceases to be a shareholder are:

                        •  the person sells all of their shares in the company and the company registers the transfer of the shares

                        •  the company buys back all the person’s shares

                        •  the ASC cancels the company’s registration.

\[sections 117, 120, 601AA–601AD]

6.2 Classes of shares

                   A company may have different classes of shares. The rights and restrictions attached to the shares in a class distinguish it from other classes of shares.

\[sections 254A–254B]

6.3 Meetings of shareholders

                   Directors have the power to call meetings of all shareholders or meetings of only those shareholders who hold a particular class of shares.

                   Shareholders who hold at least 5% of the votes which may be cast at a general meeting of a company have the power to call and hold a meeting themselves or to require the directors to call and hold a meeting. Meetings may be held regularly or to resolve specific questions about the management or business of the company.

                   The Law sets out rules dealing with shareholders’ meetings. 

                   A shareholder of a company may ask the company for a copy of the record of a meeting or of a decision of shareholders taken without a meeting.

\[sections 249A–251B]

6.4 Voting rights

                   Different rights to vote at meetings of shareholders may attach to different classes of shares. It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that, subject to those different rights, each shareholder has 1 vote on a show of hands and, on a poll, 1 vote for each share held.

\[sections 250E, 254A–254B]

6.5 Buying and selling shares

                   A shareholder may sell their shares but only if the sale would not breach the company’s constitution (if any). It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that the directors have a discretion to refuse to register a transfer of shares. 

\[sections 1091D–1091E]

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Signing company documents

                   A company’s power to sign, discharge and otherwise deal with contracts can be exercised by an individual acting with the company’s authority and on its behalf. A company can deal with contracts without using a common seal.

                   A company may execute a document by having it signed by:

                        •  2 directors of the company; or

                        •  a director and the company secretary; or

                        •  for a company with a sole director who is also the sole secretary—that director.

                   If the document is to have effect as a deed, it should be expressed to be a deed.

\[sections 126–127, 240]

                   A company is not required to have a common seal. If it does, the seal must show the company’s name and its ACN. The seal is equivalent to the company’s signature and may be used on important company documents such as mortgages.

\[sections 123, 127(2)]

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Funding the company’s operations

                   The shareholders may fund the company’s operations by lending money to the company or by taking up other shares in the company. Except if it is raising funds from its own employees or shareholders, a proprietary company must not engage in any fundraising activity that would require the company to lodge a prospectus with the ASC (for example, advertising in a newspaper inviting people to invest in the company).

                   The company may also borrow money from banks and other financial organisations.

                   Anyone who has lent money, or provided credit, to the company may ask for a mortgage or charge over the company’s assets to secure the performance by the company of its obligations.

\[sections 113, 124]

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Returns to shareholders

                   Shareholders can take money out of the company in a number of ways, but only if the company complies with its constitution (if any), the Corporations Law and all other relevant laws. If a company pays out money in a way that results in the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due, its directors may be liable:

                        •  to pay compensation; and

                        •  for criminal and civil penalties.

\[sections 588G, 1317FA, 1317HA, 1317HB, 1317HD]

9.1 Dividends

                   Dividends are payments to shareholders out of the company’s after tax profits. It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that the directors decide whether the company should pay a dividend.

\[sections 254T, 254U]

9.2 Buy–back of shares

                   A company can buy back shares from shareholders.

\[sections 257A–257J]

9.4 Distribution of surplus assets on winding up

                   If a company is wound up and there are any assets left over after all the company’s debts have been paid, the surplus is distributed to shareholders in accordance with the rights attaching to their shares.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Annual financial reports and audit

10.1 The small/large distinction

                   The accounting requirements imposed on a proprietary company under the Corporations Law depend on whether the company is classified as small or large. A company’s classification can change from 1 financial year to another as its circumstances change.

                   A company is classified as small for a financial year if it satisfies at least 2 of the following tests:

                        •  gross operating revenue of less than $10 million for the year

                        •  gross assets of less than $5 million at the end of the year

                        •  fewer than 50 employees at the end of the year.

                   A company that does not satisfy at least 2 of these tests is classified as large.

\[section 45A]

                   As the great majority of proprietary companies are small under these tests, the discussion below deals mainly with the accounting requirements for small proprietary companies.

\[sections 286–301]

10.2 Financial records

                   Under the Corporations Law, all proprietary companies must keep sufficient financial records to record and explain their transactions and financial position and to allow true and fair financial statements to be prepared and audited. **_Financial record_** here means some kind of systematic record of the company’s financial transactions—not merely a collection of receipts, invoices, bank statements and cheque butts. Financial records may be kept on computer.

\[sections 286–289]

10.3 Preparing annual financial reports and directors’ reports

                   The Corporations Law requires a small proprietary company to prepare an annual financial report (an annual profit and loss statement, a balance sheet and a statement of cash flows) and a directors’ report (about the company’s operations, dividends paid or recommended, options issued etc.) if:

                        •  the shareholders with at least 5% of the votes in the company direct it to do so; or

                        •  the ASC directs it to do so.

                   Unless the shareholders’ direction specifies otherwise, the company must prepare the annual financial report in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.

                   Although the Corporations Law itself may not require a small proprietary company to prepare a financial report except in the circumstances mentioned, the company may need to prepare the annual financial reports for the purposes of other laws (for example, income tax laws). Moreover, good business practice may also make it advisable for the company to prepare the financial reports so that it can monitor and better manage its financial position.

                   Large proprietary companies must prepare annual financial reports and a directors’ report, have the financial report audited and send both reports to shareholders. They must also lodge the annual financial reports with the ASC unless exempted.

\[sections 286–301, 319–320]

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Disagreements within the company

11.1 Special problems faced by minority shareholders

                   There are remedies available to a shareholder of a company if:

                        •  the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way that is unfair to that shareholder or to other shareholders of the company; or

                        •  the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way that is against the interests of the company as a whole.

                   A Court may, for example, order the winding up of a company or the appointment of a receiver.

\[sections 246AA, 461]

11.2 Buy–back of shares

                   A company may buy back the shares of a shareholder who wants to sever their relationship with the company.

\[sections 257A–257J]

11.3 Selling shares

                   A shareholder in a company who wants to sever their relationship with the company may decide to sell their shares. However, the shareholder may not be able to sell their shares readily—particularly if they want to sell their shares to someone who is not an existing shareholder. Some of the difficulties they may face in that case are:

                        •  under the replaceable rules the directors have a discretion to refuse to transfer the shares; and

                        •  restrictions in the company’s constitution (if any) on transferring shares.

\[sections 995, 1018, 1091D–1091E] 

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Companies in financial trouble

12.1 Voluntary administration

                   If a company experiences financial problems, the directors may appoint an administrator to take over the operations of the company to see if the company’s creditors and the company can work out a solution to the company’s problems.

                   If the company’s creditors and the company cannot agree, the company may be wound up (see 12.3).

\[Part 5.3A]

12.2 Receivers

                   A receiver, or receiver and manager, may be appointed by order of a Court or under an agreement with a secured creditor to take over some or all of the assets of a company. Generally this would occur if the company is in financial difficulty. A receiver may be appointed, for example, because an amount owed to a secured creditor is overdue.

\[Part 5.2]

12.3 Winding up and distribution

                   A company may be wound up by order of a Court, or voluntarily if the shareholders of the company pass a special resolution to do so.

                   A liquidator is appointed:

                        •  when a Court orders a company to be wound up; or

                        •  the shareholders of a company pass a resolution to wind up the company.

\[Part 5.2, section 495]

12.4 Liquidators

                   A liquidator is appointed to administer the winding up of a company. The liquidator’s main functions are:

                        •  to take possession of the company’s assets; and

                        •  to determine debts owed by the company and pay the company’s creditors; and

                        •  to distribute to shareholders any assets of the company left over after paying creditors (any distribution to shareholders is made according to the rights attaching to their shares); and

                        •  finally, to have the company deregistered.

\[Parts 5.4B, 5.5]

12.5 Order of payment of debts

                   Generally, creditors who hold security over company assets are paid first.

\[Division 6 of Part 5.6]

12.6 Cancellation of registration

                   If a company has ceased trading or has been wound up, it remains on the register until the ASC cancels the company’s registration. Once a company is deregistered, it ceases to exist.

## Part 2B.1—Company powers and how they are exercised

##### <a id="124"></a>124  Legal capacity and powers of a company

             (1)  A company has the legal capacity and powers of an individual both in and outside this jurisdiction. A company also has all the powers of a body corporate, including the power to:

                     (a)  issue and cancel shares in the company

                     (b)  issue debentures

                     (c)  grant options over unissued shares in the company

                     (h)  do anything that it is authorised to do by any other law (including a law of a foreign country).

A company limited by guarantee does not have the power to issue shares.

Note:          For a company’s power to issue bonus, partly–paid, preference and redeemable preference shares, see section 254A.

             (2)  A company’s legal capacity to do something is not affected by the fact that the company’s interests are not, or would not be, served by doing it.

##### <a id="125"></a>125  Constitution may limit powers and set out objects

             (1)  If a company has a constitution, it may contain an express restriction on, or a prohibition of, the company’s exercise of any of its powers. The exercise of a power by the company is not invalid merely because it is contrary to an express restriction or prohibition in the company’s constitution.

(2)  If a company has a constitution, it may set out the company’s objects. An act of the company is not invalid merely because it is contrary to or beyond any objects in the company’s constitution.

##### <a id="126"></a>126  Agent exercising a company’s power to make contracts 

             (1)  A company’s power to make, vary, ratify or discharge a contract may be exercised by an individual acting with the company’s express or implied authority and on behalf of the company. The power may be exercised without using a common seal.

             (2)  This section does not affect the operation of a law that requires a particular procedure to be complied with in relation to the contract.

##### <a id="127"></a>127  Execution of documents (including deeds) by the company itself

             (1)  A company may execute a document without using a common seal if the document is signed by:

                     (a)  2 directors of the company; or

                     (b)  a director and a company secretary of the company; or

                     (c)  for a proprietary company that has a sole director who is also the sole company secretary—that director.

Note:          If a company executes a document in this way, people will be able to rely on the assumptions in subsection 129(5) for dealings in relation to the company.

             (2)  A company with a common seal may execute a document if the seal is fixed to the document and the fixing of the seal is witnessed by:

                     (a)  2 directors of the company; or

                     (b)  a director and a company secretary of the company; or

                     (c)  for a proprietary company that has a sole director who is also the sole company secretary—that director.

Note:          If a company executes a document in this way, people will be able to rely on the assumptions in subsection 129(6) for dealings in relation to the company.

             (3)  A company may execute a document as a deed if the document is expressed to be executed as a deed and is executed in accordance with subsection (1) or (2).

             (4)  This section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document (including a deed).

## Part 2B.2—Assumptions people dealing with companies are entitled to make

##### <a id="128"></a>128  Entitlement to make assumptions

             (1)  A person is entitled to make the assumptions in section 129 in relation to dealings with a company. The company is not entitled to assert in proceedings in relation to the dealings that any of the assumptions are incorrect.

             (2)  A person is entitled to make the assumptions in section 129 in relation to dealings with another person who has, or purports to have, directly or indirectly acquired title to property from a company. The company and the other person are not entitled to assert in proceedings in relation to the dealings that any of the assumptions are incorrect.

             (3)  The assumptions may be made even if an officer or agent of the company acts fraudulently, or forges a document, in connection with the dealings.

             (4)  A person is not entitled to make an assumption in section 129 if at the time of the dealings they knew or suspected that the assumption was incorrect.

##### <a id="129"></a>129  Assumptions that can be made under section 128

Constitution and replaceable rules complied with

             (1)  A person may assume that the company’s constitution (if any), and any provisions of this Law that apply to the company as replaceable rules, have been complied with.

Director or company secretary

             (2)  A person may assume that anyone who appears, from information provided by the company that is available to the public from the ASC, to be a director or a company secretary of the company:

                     (a)  has been duly appointed; and

                     (b)  has authority to exercise the powers and perform the duties customarily exercised or performed by a director or company secretary of a similar company.

Officer or agent

             (3)  A person may assume that anyone who is held out by the company to be an officer or agent of the company:

                     (a)  has been duly appointed; and

                     (b)  has authority to exercise the powers and perform the duties customarily exercised or performed by that kind of officer or agent of a similar company.

Proper performance of duties

             (4)  A person may assume that the officers and agents of the company properly perform their duties to the company.

Document duly executed without seal

             (5)  A person may assume that a document has been duly executed by the company if the document appears to have been signed in accordance with subsection 127(1). For the purposes of making the assumption, a person may also assume that anyone who signs the document and states next to their signature that they are the sole director and sole company secretary of the company occupies both offices.

Document duly executed with seal

             (6)  A person may assume that a document has been duly executed by the company if:

                     (a)  the company’s common seal appears to have been fixed to the document in accordance with subsection 127(2); and

                     (b)  the fixing of the common seal appears to have been witnessed in accordance with that subsection.

For the purposes of making the assumption, a person may also assume that anyone who witnesses the fixing of the common seal and states next to their signature that they are the sole director and sole company secretary of the company occupies both offices.

Officer or agent with authority to warrant that document is genuine or true copy

             (7)  A person may assume that an officer or agent of the company who has authority to issue a document or a certified copy of a document on its behalf also has authority to warrant that the document is genuine or is a true copy.

             (8)  Without limiting the generality of this section, the assumptions that may be made under this section apply for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="130"></a>130  Information available to the public from the ASC does not constitute constructive notice

             (1)  A person is not taken to have information about a company merely because the information is available to the public from the ASC.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a document that has been lodged with the ASC to the extent that the document relates to a charge that is registrable under this Law.

## Part 2B.3—Contracts before registration

##### <a id="131"></a>131  Contracts before registration

             (1)  If a person enters into, or purports to enter into, a contract on behalf of, or for the benefit of, a company before it is registered, the company becomes bound by the contract and entitled to its benefit if the company, or a company that is reasonably identifiable with it, is registered and ratifies the contract:

                     (a)  within the time agreed to by the parties to the contract; or

                     (b)  if there is no agreed time—within a reasonable time after the contract is entered into.

             (2)  The person is liable to pay damages to each other party to the pre‑registration contract if the company is not registered, or the company is registered but does not ratify the contract or enter into a substitute for it:

                     (a)  within the time agreed to by the parties to the contract; or

                     (b)  if there is no agreed time—within a reasonable time after the contract is entered into.

The amount that the person is liable to pay to a party is the amount the company would be liable to pay to the party if the company had ratified the contract and then did not perform it at all.

             (3)  If proceedings are brought to recover damages under subsection (2) because the company is registered but does not ratify the pre‑registration contract or enter into a substitute for it, the court may do anything that it considers appropriate in the circumstances, including ordering the company to do 1 or more of the following:

                     (a)  pay all or part of the damages that the person is liable to pay 

                     (b)  transfer property that the company received because of the contract to a party to the contract

                     (c)  pay an amount to a party to the contract.

             (4)  If the company ratifies the pre–registration contract but fails to perform all or part of it, the court may order the person to pay all or part of the damages that the company is ordered to pay.

##### <a id="132"></a>132  Person may be released from liability but is not entitled to indemnity

             (1)  A party to the pre–registration contract may release the person from all or part of their liability under section 131 to the party by signing a release.

             (2)  Despite any rule of law or equity, the person does not have any right of indemnity against the company in respect of the person’s liability under this Part. This is so even if the person was acting, or purporting to act, as trustee for the company.

##### <a id="133"></a>133  This Part replaces other rights and liabilities 

                   This Part replaces any rights or liabilities anyone would otherwise have on the pre–registration contract.

## Part 2B.4—Replaceable rules and constitution

##### <a id="134"></a>134  Internal management of companies

                   A company’s internal management may be governed by provisions of this Law that apply to the company as replaceable rules, by a constitution or by a combination of both.

Note:          There are additional rules about internal management in ordinary provisions of this Law and also in the common law.

##### <a id="135"></a>135  Replaceable rules

Companies to which replaceable rules apply

             (1)  A section or subsection (except subsection 129(1), this section and sections 140 and 141) whose heading contains the words:

                     (a)  _replaceable rule_—applies as a replaceable rule to:

                              (i)  each company that is registered after the commencement of this Part; and

                             (ii)  any company registered before that commencement that repeals its constitution after that commencement; and

                     (b)  _replaceable rule for proprietary companies and mandatory rule for public companies_—applies:

                              (i)  as a replaceable rule to any proprietary company that is registered after the commencement of this Part; and

                             (ii)  as a replaceable rule to any company that is registered after that commencement and that changes to a proprietary company (but only while it is a proprietary company); and

                            (iii)  as a replaceable rule to any proprietary company registered before that commencement that repeals its constitution after that commencement; and

                            (iv)  as an ordinary provision of this Law to any public company whenever registered.

                   The section or subsection does not apply to a proprietary company while the same person is both its sole director and sole shareholder.

Note 1:       See section 224B for the special provisions that apply to a proprietary company while the same person is both its sole director and sole shareholder.

Note 2:       A company may include in its constitution (by reference or otherwise) a replaceable rule that does not otherwise apply to it.

Company’s constitution can displace or modify replaceable rules

             (2)  A provision of a section or subsection that applies to a company as a replaceable rule can be displaced or modified by the company’s constitution.

Failure to comply with replaceable rules

             (3)  A failure to comply with the replaceable rules as they apply to a company is not of itself a contravention of this Law (so the provisions about criminal liability, civil liability and injunctions do not apply).

Note:          Replaceable rules that apply to a company have effect as a contract (see section 140).

##### <a id="136"></a>136  Constitution of a company

             (1)  A company adopts a constitution:

                     (a)  on registration—if each person specified in the application for the company’s registration as a person who consents to become a member agrees in writing to the terms of a constitution before the application is lodged; or

                     (b)  after registration—if the company passes a special resolution adopting a constitution.

Note:          The memorandum and articles of a company immediately before the commencement of this Part are taken together to make up the company’s constitution after commencement (see section 1414).

             (2)  The company may modify or repeal its constitution, or a provision of its constitution, by special resolution.

             (3)  The company’s constitution may provide that the special resolution does not have any effect unless a further requirement specified in the constitution relating to that modification or repeal has been complied with.

             (4)  Unless the constitution provides otherwise, the company may modify or repeal a further requirement described in subsection (3) only if the further requirement is itself complied with.

             (5)  A public company must lodge with the ASC a copy of a special resolution adopting, modifying or repealing its constitution within 14 days after it is passed. The company must also lodge with the ASC within that period:

                     (a)  if the company adopts a constitution—a copy of that constitution; or

                     (b)  if the company modifies its constitution—a copy of that modification.

This also applies to a proprietary company that has applied under Part 2B.7 to change to a public company, while its application has not yet been determined.

##### <a id="137"></a>137  Date of effect of adoption, modification or repeal of constitution

             (1)  A special resolution adopting, modifying or repealing a company’s constitution takes effect:

                     (a)  if no later date is specified in the resolution—on the date on which the resolution is passed; or

                     (b)  on a later date specified in, or determined in accordance with, the resolution.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to the date of effect of a special resolution passed in connection with a change of name, change of type or a variation or cancellation of class rights.

Note:          For the date of effect of these changes, see subsection 157(3) (name), subsection 164(5) (type) and subsection 246D(3) and section 246E (class rights).

##### <a id="138"></a>138  ASC may direct company to lodge consolidated constitution

                   The ASC may direct a company to lodge a consolidated copy of its constitution with the ASC.

##### <a id="139"></a>139  Company must send copy of constitution to member

                   A company must send a copy of its constitution to a member of the company within 7 days if the member:

                     (a)  asks the company, in writing, for the copy; and

                     (b)  pays any fee (up to the prescribed amount) required by the company.

##### <a id="140"></a>140  Effect of constitution and replaceable rules

             (1)  A company’s constitution (if any) and any replaceable rules that apply to the company have effect as a contract:

                     (a)  between the company and each member; and

                     (b)  between the company and each director and company secretary; and

                     (c)  between a member and each other member;

under which each person agrees to observe and perform the constitution and rules so far as they apply to that person.

             (2)  Unless a member of a company agrees in writing to be bound, they are not bound by a modification of the constitution made after the date on which they became a member so far as the modification:

                     (a)  requires the member to take up additional shares; or

                     (b)  increases the member’s liability to contribute to the share capital of, or otherwise to pay money to, the company; or

                     (c)  imposes or increases restrictions on the right to transfer the shares already held by the member, unless the modification is made:

                              (i)  in connection with the company’s change from a public company to a proprietary company under Part 2B.7; or

                             (ii)  to insert takeover approval provisions of a kind referred to in section 671.

##### <a id="141"></a>141  Table of replaceable rules

                   The following table sets out the provisions of this Law that apply as replaceable rules.

If the responsible entity does not specify 1 or more of those things, the meeting is adjourned to:

                     (a)  if the date is not specified—the same day in the next week; and

                     (b)  if the time is not specified—the same time; and

             (2)  The appointment may specify the proportion or number of votes that the proxy may exercise.

             (3)  A member may appoint 1 or 2 proxies. If the member appoints 2 proxies and the appointment does not specify the proportion or number of the member’s votes each proxy may exercise, each proxy may exercise half of the votes.

##### <a id="252W"></a>252W  Rights of proxies

Rights of proxies

             (1)  A proxy appointed to attend and vote for a member has the same rights as the member:

                     (a)  to speak at the meeting; and

                     (b)  to vote (but only to the extent allowed by the appointment).

Proxy’s right to vote

             (2)  A registered scheme’s constitution (if any) may provide that a proxy is not entitled to vote on a show of hands.

Note:          Even if the proxy is not entitled to vote on a show of hands, they may make or join in the demand for a poll (see section 253L).

Effect of member’s presence on proxy’s authority

             (3)  A registered scheme’s constitution (if any) may provide for the effect that a member’s presence at a meeting has on the authority of a proxy appointed to attend and vote for the member. However, if the constitution does not make such provision, a proxy’s authority to speak and vote for a member at a meeting is suspended while the member is present at the meeting.

##### <a id="252X"></a>252X  Responsible entity sending appointment forms or lists of proxies must send to all members

                   If the responsible entity of a registered scheme sends a member a proxy appointment form for a meeting or a list of persons willing to act as proxies at a meeting:

                     (a)  if the member requested the form or list—the responsible entity must send the form or list to all members who ask for it and who are entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and vote at the meeting; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the responsible entity must send the form or list to all its members entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and vote at the meeting.

##### <a id="252Y"></a>252Y  Appointing a proxy

                     (b)  the scheme’s name

                     (c)  the proxy’s name or the name of the office held by the proxy

                     (d)  the meetings at which the appointment may be used.

             (3)  An undated appointment is taken to have been dated on the day it is given to the responsible entity.

             (4)  An appointment may specify the way the proxy is to vote on a particular resolution. If it does:

                     (a)  the proxy need not vote on a show of hands, but if the proxy does so, the proxy must vote that way; and

                     (b)  if the proxy has 2 or more appointments that specify different ways to vote on the resolution—the proxy must not vote on a show of hands; and

                     (c)  if the proxy is the chair—the proxy must vote on a poll, and must vote that way; and

                     (d)  if the proxy is not the chair—the proxy need not vote on a poll, but if the proxy does so, the proxy must vote that way.

If a proxy is also a member, this subsection does not affect the way that the person can cast any votes they hold as a member.

Note:          The scheme’s constitution may provide that a proxy is not entitled to vote on a show of hands (see subsection 252W(2)).

             (5)  A person who contravenes subsection (4) is guilty of an offence, but only if their appointment as a proxy resulted from the responsible entity sending to members:

                     (a)  a list of persons willing to act as proxies; or

                     (b)  a proxy appointment form holding the person out as being willing to act as a proxy.

             (6)  An appointment does not have to be witnessed.

Proxy vote valid even if member dies, revokes appointment etc.

             (1)  Unless the responsible entity has received written notice of the matter before the start or resumption of the meeting at which a proxy votes, a vote cast by the proxy will be valid even if, before the proxy votes:

                   The responsible entity of a registered scheme and its associates are not entitled to vote their interest on a resolution at a meeting of the scheme’s members if they have an interest in the resolution or matter other than as a member.

Note:          The responsible entity and its associates may vote as proxies if their appointments specify the way they are to vote and they vote that way (see subsection 253A(2)).

##### <a id="253F"></a>253F  How to work out the value of an interest

                   The value of an interest in a registered scheme is:

                     (b)  if it is not quoted on a stock market of a stock exchange and the scheme is liquid and has a withdrawal provision in its constitution—the amount that would be paid for the interest under that provision on the business day immediately before the day on which the poll is taken; or

                     (c)  in any other case—the amount that the responsible entity determines in writing to be the price that a willing but not anxious buyer would pay for the interest if it was sold on the business day immediately before the day on which the poll is taken.

             (3)  On a show of hands, a declaration by the chair is conclusive evidence of the result. Neither the chair nor the minutes need to state the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour or against.

Note:          Even though the chair’s declaration is conclusive of the voting results, the members present may demand a poll (see paragraph 253L(3)(c)).

                     (b)  members present with at least 5% of the votes that may be cast on the resolution on a poll; or

                     (c)  the chair.

             (2)  A registered scheme’s constitution may provide that fewer members or members with a lesser percentage of votes may demand a poll.

             (3)  The poll may be demanded:

                     (a)  before a vote is taken; or

                     (b)  before the voting results on a show of hands are declared; or

##### <a id="253N"></a>253N  Members’ access to minutes

             (1)  The responsible entity of a registered scheme must ensure that the minute books for the meetings of the scheme’s members are open for inspection by members free of charge.

             (2)  A member of a registered scheme may ask the responsible entity in writing for a copy of any minutes of a meeting of the scheme’s members or an extract of the minutes.

Note:          This subsection deals with the redemption of the nominal value of the shares.

             (2)  If the shares are not redeemed out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares, the company must transfer an amount equal to the nominal value of the shares out of profits and into its capital redemption reserve.

Note:          Sections 256A‑256D (reductions in share capital) apply to amounts in the capital redemption reserve as well as to amounts in the share capital account.

             (3)  The premium (if any) payable on redemption must be paid out of profits or out of the share premium account.

the share must be held by the directors in trust for the company. It must be then disposed of in the manner determined by the company in accordance with its constitution or by resolution. Unless otherwise specifically provided by resolution, the share must first be offered to shareholders for a period of 14 days before being disposed of in any other manner.

Suspension of voting rights attached to share held in trust

           (10)  At any meeting of the company, no person is entitled to any vote in respect of the shares held by the directors in trust under subsection (9).

Application of proceeds of sale

           (11)  The proceeds of the sale under subsection (2) or the disposal under subsection (9) must be applied to pay:

Validity of sale

           (12)  If a sale is not held in time because of error or inadvertence, a late sale is not invalid if it is held as soon as practicable after the discovery of the error or inadvertence.

Failure to comply an offence

           (13)  If there is failure to comply with subsection (2) or (3), the company and any officer of the company who is involved in the contravention are each guilty of an offence.

# Chapter 2J—Transactions affecting share capital

## Part 2J.1—Share capital reductions and share
 buy‑backs

### Division 1—Reductions in share capital not otherwise authorised by law

##### <a id="256A"></a>256A  Reductions in share capital

Requirement for special resolution and Court confirmation

             (1)  A company must not reduce its share capital unless:

                     (a)  the reduction is authorised by law; or

                     (b)  the reduction is:

                              (i)  agreed to by a special resolution; and

                             (ii)  confirmed by the Court under section 256B.

Note 1:       Examples of share capital reductions are:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>extinguishing or reducing a person’s liability on shares in respect of share capital not paid up

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>cancelling paid‑up share capital that is lost or is not represented by available assets

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>paying off any paid‑up share capital that is in excess of the company’s needs.

Note 2:       Sections 258A‑258F deal with some of the other situations in which reductions of share capital are authorised.

Note 3:       Subsection 256B(2) provides that the Court will generally not confirm a reduction in share capital unless a creditor protection test in section 256C is satisfied

Note 4:       If the nominal value of shares affected by the reduction is specified in the company’s constitution, the company may amend its constitution by special resolution to make any necessary adjustments to the nominal value of those shares.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), paying an amount out of the company’s share premium account or capital redemption reserve is to be treated as a reduction in the company’s paid up share capital.

Note:          Certain payments out of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve are authorised under subsections 254CB(3) and 254K(2) and (4).

##### <a id="256B"></a>256B  Court order confirming the reduction

             (1)  The Court may confirm a reduction in share capital on the terms and conditions that it considers appropriate.

             (2)  If the reduction involves:

                     (a)  reducing a person’s liability for unpaid share capital; or

                     (b)  paying a shareholder:

                              (i)  paid‑up share capital; or

                             (ii)  an amount out of the share premium account or capital redemption reserve;

the Court may only confirm the reduction if:

                     (c)  the reduction satisfies the creditor protection test in section 256C; or

                     (d)  the Court is satisfied that the reduction does not need to satisfy the creditor protection test in section 256C because of the special circumstances of the case.

             (3)  The Court may direct that a reduction that would not otherwise have to satisfy the creditor protection test in section 256C must satisfy that test.

             (4)  The order confirming the reduction must specify:

                     (a)  the nominal value of each share; and

                     (b)  the amount (if any) that at the date of the order is taken to be paid up on each share.

##### <a id="256C"></a>256C  The creditor protection test

Identifying the company’s creditors

             (1)  If a reduction in share capital has to satisfy the creditor protection test:

                     (a)  the Court must fix the date for determining who the company’s creditors are; and

                     (b)  the company must prepare a list of the company’s creditors as at that date that shows the nature and amount of their debts or claims and present it to the Court; and

                     (c)  the Court must:

                              (i)  settle the list of creditors; and

                             (ii)  ascertain (as far as possible) the nature and amount of their debts or claims.

             (2)  To settle the list of creditors and ascertain the nature and amount of their debts, the Court:

                     (a)  need not require an application from any creditor; and

                     (b)  may publish notices fixing a day by which creditors whose names are not on the list may claim to be included on the list.

             (3)  A person is a creditor of the company for the purposes of this section if they:

                     (a)  are entitled to a debt or claim at the date fixed by the Court under paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  would be able to prove the debt or claim against the company if a winding up of the company commenced on that date.

A creditor is entitled to become a party to the proceedings for the Court’s confirmation of the reduction.

Satisfying the creditor protection test

             (4)  A reduction in share capital satisfies the creditor protection test if each creditor on the list settled by the Court:

                     (a)  consents to the reduction; or

                     (b)  has their debt discharged or their claim determined; or

                     (c)  has their debt or claim secured; or

                     (d)  has their debt or claim provided for under subsection (5).

             (5)  A creditor’s debt or claim is provided for under this subsection if the company appropriates an amount to cover the debt or claim in the manner approved by the Court. The amount appropriated must be:

                     (a)  the full amount of the debt or claim if:

                              (i)  the company admits that amount; or

                             (ii)  the company does not admit that amount but is willing to provide for it; or

                     (b)  the amount fixed by the Court if:

                              (i)  the company does not admit, and is not willing to provide for, the full amount of the debt or claim; or

                             (ii)  the amount of the debt or claim is contingent or not ascertained.

In fixing an amount under paragraph (b), the Court must make the inquiries and adjudicate on the matter as if the company were being wound up by the Court.

             (6)  Having regard to any special circumstances of any case, the Court may direct that particular requirements of this section do not apply in respect of creditors included in a class of creditors.

Company officers not to conceal or misrepresent debts or claims

             (7)  An officer of a company must not:

                     (a)  knowingly conceal from the company or the Court the name of a creditor of the company; or

                     (b)  knowingly misrepresent to the company or the Court the nature or amount of the debt or claim of a creditor of the company.

##### <a id="256D"></a>256D  Putting the capital reduction into effect

Lodgment of resolution and court order with the ASC

             (1)  The company must lodge with the ASC copies of:

                     (a)  the special resolution; and

                     (b)  the Court order confirming the reduction.

Implementation of capital reduction

             (2)  A company must not act upon a resolution to reduce its share capital before the date on which the documents are lodged with the ASC under subsection (1). However, the resolution may specify as the date from which the reduction of capital is to have effect a date that is earlier than the lodgment date but not earlier than the date of the resolution.

##### <a id="256E"></a>256E  Effect of reduction of share capital on members and former members

Effect of reduction on liability of members and former members for calls and contributions

             (1)  The liability of a member or former member of a company for a call or contribution in respect of a share in the company is not to exceed the difference (if any) between:

                     (a)  the amount of the share fixed by the confirming order under subsection 256B(4); and

                     (b)  the amount paid, or the reduced amount (if any) that is taken to have been paid, on the share.

Liability of members and former members to unsatisfied creditors

             (2)  A person who is a member of the company on the date on which the copy of the confirming order is lodged with the ASC under subsection 256D(1) is liable to contribute towards the payment of a creditor’s debt or claim if:

                     (a)  the creditor is a creditor of the company for the purposes of section 256C; and

                     (b)  the creditor’s name is not entered on the list of creditors settled under that section because they are not aware of:

                              (i)  the proceedings for confirmation of the reduction; or

                             (ii)  the nature of the proceedings and the effect of the proceedings on their claim; and

                     (c)  after the reduction, the company is unable (within the meaning of the provisions of this Law with respect to winding up by the Court) to pay the debt or claim in full.

The amount the person is liable to contribute is not to exceed the amount that they would have been liable to contribute if the company had commenced to be wound up on the day before that date.

Liability as contributory on winding up

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the company is wound up; and

                     (b)  the creditor referred to in subsection (2) applies to the Court; and

                     (c)  the creditor proves that they were not aware of:

                              (i)  the proceedings for confirmation of the reduction; or

                             (ii)  the nature of the proceedings or effect of the proceedings on the debt or claim; and

                     (d)  the Court considers it appropriate to do so;

the Court may:

                     (e)  settle a list of the names of people liable to contribute under subsection (2); and

                      (f)  make and enforce calls and orders on the contributories whose names are included in the list as if they were ordinary contributories in a winding up.

Nothing in this subsection affects the rights of the contributories among themselves.

##### <a id="256F"></a>256F  Consequences of failing to comply with section 256A

             (1)  A company must not make a reduction in share capital unless it complies with subsection 256A(1).

             (2)  If the company contravenes subsection (1):

                     (a)  the contravention does not affect the validity of the reduction or of any contract or transaction connected with it; and

                     (b)  the company is not guilty of an offence.

             (3)  Any person who is involved in a company’s contravention of subsection (1) contravenes this subsection.

Note:          Subsection (3) is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317DA).

### Division 2—Share buy‑backs

##### <a id="257AA"></a>257AA  Purpose

                   The rules to be followed by a company for share buy‑backs are designed to protect the interests of shareholders and creditors by:

                     (a)  addressing the risk of buy‑backs leading to the company’s insolvency

                     (b)  seeking to ensure fairness between the company’s shareholders

                     (c)  requiring the company to disclose all material information.

##### <a id="257A"></a>257A  The company’s power to buy back its own shares

                   A company may buy back its own shares (other than redeemable preference shares) if:

                     (a)  the buy‑back does not materially prejudice the company’s ability to pay its creditors; and

                     (b)  the company follows the procedures laid down in this Division.

Note 1:       If a company has a constitution, it may include provisions in the constitution that preclude the company buying back its own shares or impose restrictions on the exercise of the company’s power to buy back its own shares.

Note 2:       A company may buy‑back redeemable preference shares and may do so on terms other than the terms on which they could be redeemed. For the redemption of redeemable preference shares, see sections 254J‑254L.

##### <a id="257B"></a>257B  Buy‑back procedure—general

             (1)  The following table specifies the steps required for, and the sections that apply to, the different types of buy‑back.

Note:          Subsections (2) and (3) of this section explain what an equal access scheme is. The 10/12 limit is the 10% in 12 months limit laid down in subsections (4) and (5). Subsections (6) and (7) of this section explain what an on‑market buy‑back is. See section 9 for definitions of **_minimum holding buy‑back_**, **_employee share scheme buy‑back_** and **_selective buy‑back_**.

Equal access scheme

             (2)  An equal access scheme is a scheme that satisfies all the following conditions:

                     (a)  the offers under the scheme relate only to ordinary shares

                     (b)  the offers are to be made to every person who holds ordinary shares to buy back the same percentage of their ordinary shares

                     (c)  all of those persons have a reasonable opportunity to accept the offers made to them

                     (d)  buy‑back agreements are not entered into until a specified time for acceptances of offers has closed

                     (e)  the terms of all the offers are the same.

             (3)  In applying subsection (2), ignore:

                     (a)  differences in consideration attributable to the fact that the offers relate to shares having different accrued dividend entitlements

                     (b)  differences in consideration attributable to the fact that the offers relate to shares on which different amounts remain unpaid

                     (c)  differences in the offers introduced solely to ensure that each shareholder is left with a whole number of shares.

10/12 limit

             (4)  The 10/12 limit for a company proposing to make a buy‑back is 10% of the smallest number, at any time during the last 
 12 months, of votes attaching to voting shares of the company.

Exceeding the 10/12 limit

             (5)  A proposed buy‑back would exceed the 10/12 limit if the number of votes attaching to:

                     (a)  all the voting shares in the company that have been bought back during the last 12 months; and

                     (b)  the voting shares that will be bought back if the proposed buy‑back is made;

would exceed the 10/12 limit.

On‑market buy‑backs

             (6)  A buy‑back is an on‑market buy‑back if it results from an offer made by a listed corporation at an official meeting of a securities exchange in Australia in the ordinary course of trading on a stock market of that exchange.

             (7)  A buy‑back by a company (whether listed or not) is also an on‑market buy‑back if it results from an offer made in the ordinary course of trading on a stock market of a body corporate that:

                     (a)  operates a securities market outside Australia; and

                     (b)  the ASC declares in writing to be an approved overseas securities exchange for the purposes of this subsection.

A buy‑back by a listed company is an on‑market buy‑back under this subsection only if an offer to buy‑back those shares is also made on a stock market of a securities exchange in Australia at the same time.

             (8)  A declaration under paragraph (7)(b) may be subject to conditions. Notice of the making of the declaration must be published in the _Gazette_.

##### <a id="257C"></a>257C  Buy‑back procedure—shareholder approval if the 10/12 limit exceeded

Ordinary resolution required

             (1)  If section 257B applies this section to a buy‑back, the terms of the buy‑back agreement must be approved before it is entered into by a resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, or the agreement must be conditional on such an approval.

Information to accompany the notice of meeting

             (2)  The company must include with the notice of the meeting a statement setting out all information known to the company that is material to the decision how to vote on the resolution. However, the company does not have to disclose information if it would be unreasonable to require the company to do so because the company had previously disclosed the information to its shareholders.

Documents to be lodged with the ASC

             (3)  Before the notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders, the company must lodge with the ASC a copy of:

                     (a)  the notice of the meeting; and

                     (b)  any document relating to the buy‑back that will accompany the notice of the meeting sent to shareholders.

##### <a id="257D"></a>257D  Buy‑back procedure—special shareholder approval for selective buy‑back

Selective buy‑back requires special or unanimous resolution

             (1)  If section 257B applies this section to a buy‑back, the terms of the buy‑back agreement must be approved before it is entered into by either:

                     (a)  a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, with no votes being cast in favour of the resolution by any person whose shares are proposed to be bought back or by their associates; or

                     (b)  a resolution agreed to, at a general meeting, by all ordinary shareholders;

or the agreement must be conditional on such an approval.

Information to accompany the notice of meeting

             (2)  The company must include with the notice of the meeting a statement setting out all information known to the company that is material to the decision how to vote on the resolution. However, the company does not have to disclose information if it would be unreasonable to require the company to do so because the company had previously disclosed the information to its shareholders.

Documents to be lodged with the ASC

             (3)  Before the notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders, the company must lodge with the ASC a copy of:

                     (a)  the notice of the meeting; and 

                     (b)  any document relating to the buy‑back that will accompany the notice of the meeting sent to shareholders.

             (4)  The ASC may exempt a company from the operation of this section. The exemption:

                     (a)  must be in writing; and

                     (b)  must be granted before the buy‑back agreement is entered into; and

                     (c)  may be granted subject to conditions.

##### <a id="257E"></a>257E  Buy‑back procedure—lodgment of offer documents with the ASC

                   If section 257B applies this section to a buy‑back, the company must lodge with the ASC, before the buy‑back agreement is entered into, a copy of:

                     (a)  a document setting out the terms of the offer; and

                     (b)  any document that is to accompany the offer.

##### <a id="257F"></a>257F  Notice of intended buy‑back

             (1)  If section 257B applies this section to a buy‑back, the company must satisfy the lodgment requirement in subsection (2) at least 14 days before:

                     (a)  if the buy‑back agreement is conditional on the passing of a resolution under subsection 257C(1) or 257D(1)—the resolution is passed; or

                     (b)  if it is not—the agreement is entered into.

             (2)  The company satisfies the lodgment requirement when it lodges with the ASC:

                     (a)  documents under subsection 257C(3) or 257D(3) or section 257E; or

                     (b)  a notice that the company intends to carry out the buy‑back.

Note 1:       A company that has to lodge documents under section 257C, 257D or 257E needs to lodge a notice under paragraph (2)(b) of this section only if it wants for some reason to enter into the agreement or pass the resolution less than 14 days after lodging the section 257C, 257D or 257E documents.

Note 2:       The company may specify a buy‑back under paragraph (2)(b) in any way. It may, for instance, choose to lodge a notice covering buy‑backs to be carried out:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>under a particular scheme; or

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>as part of particular on‑market buy‑back activity.

##### <a id="257G"></a>257G  Buy‑back procedure—disclosure of relevant information when offer made

                   If section 257B applies this section to a buy‑back, the company must include with the offer to buy back shares a statement setting out all information known to the company that is material to the decision whether to accept the offer.

##### <a id="257H"></a>257H  Acceptance of offer and transfer of shares to the company

Effect of acceptance of the buy‑back offer on share rights

             (1)  Once a company has entered into an agreement to buy back shares, all rights attaching to the shares are suspended. The suspension is lifted if the agreement is terminated.

Shares transferred to the company and cancelled

             (2)  A company must not deal in shares it buys back. An agreement entered into in contravention of this subsection is void.

             (3)  Immediately after the registration of the transfer to the company of the shares bought back, the shares are cancelled.

Note:          The ASC must be notified of the cancellation under section 254Y.

##### <a id="257J"></a>257J  Signposts to other relevant provisions

                   The following table sets out other provisions of this Law that are relevant to buy‑backs.

### Division 3—Other share capital reductions

##### <a id="258A"></a>258A  Unlimited companies

                   An unlimited company may reduce its share capital in any way.

##### <a id="258B"></a>258B  Right to occupy or use real property

             (1)  If a company has a constitution, under it the company may grant to a shareholder, as a shareholder, a right to occupy or use real property that the company owns or holds under lease, whether the right is a lease or licence or a contractual right.

Note:          Before the introduction of strata or unit titles systems, rights to occupy real property were sometimes based on a holding of shares in a company.

             (2)  A company may transfer to a person an interest in land in exchange for, or in satisfaction of, a right to occupy or use the land of the kind referred to in subsection (1).

Example:    A person has a right to occupy an apartment in a block of units because they hold shares in a company. As part of converting the block of units to strata title, the person surrenders the shares in return for a transfer of strata title over the apartment. The capital reduction involved in the transfer is authorised under this subsection.

##### <a id="258C"></a>258C  Brokerage or commission

                   A company may pay brokerage or commission to a person in respect of that person or another person agreeing to take up shares in the company.

##### <a id="258D"></a>258D  Cancellation of forfeited shares

                   A company may, by resolution passed at a general meeting, cancel shares that have been forfeited under the terms on which the shares are on issue.

##### <a id="258E"></a>258E  Other authorised reductions

             (1)  This subsection authorises any reduction in share capital involved in:

                     (a)  the redemption of redeemable preference shares out of the proceeds of a new issue of shares made for the purpose of the redemption (see section 254K); or

                     (b)  a company’s buying‑back of its own shares under sections 257AA to 257J; or

                     (c)  the cancellation of a share under subsection 254H(1), 667(3) or 1024E(7).

             (2)  This subsection authorises any payment out of, or transfer from, a company’s share premium account under:

                     (a)  subsection 254CB(3) (permitted uses of the share premium account); or

                     (b)  subsection 254K(2) (payment of premium payable on redemption of redeemable preference shares).

             (3)  This subsection authorises any payment out of, or transfer from, a company’s capital redemption reserve under subsection 254K(4) (paying up shares to be issued to members as fully‑paid bonus shares).

##### <a id="258F"></a>258F  Reductions because of lost capital

                   A company may reduce its share capital by cancelling any paid‑up share capital that is lost or is not represented by available assets. This power does not apply if the company also cancels shares.

## Part 2J.2—Self‑acquisition and control of shares

##### <a id="259A"></a>259A  Directly acquiring own shares

                   A company must not acquire shares (or units of shares) in itself except:

                     (a)  in buying back shares under section 257A; or

                     (b)  in acquiring an interest (other than a legal interest) in fully‑paid shares in the company if no consideration is given for the acquisition by the company or an entity it controls; or

                     (c)  under a court order; or

                     (d)  in circumstances covered by subsection 259B(2) or (3).

##### <a id="259B"></a>259B  Taking security over own shares or shares in holding company

             (1)  A company must not take security over shares (or units of shares) in itself or in a company that controls it, except as permitted by subsection (2) or (3).

             (2)  A company may take security over shares in itself under an employee share scheme that has been approved by:

                     (a)  a resolution passed at a general meeting of the company; and

                     (b)  if the company is a subsidiary of a listed domestic corporation—a resolution passed at a general meeting of the listed domestic corporation; and

                     (c)  if paragraph (b) does not apply but the company has a holding company that is a domestic corporation and that is not itself a subsidiary of a domestic corporation—a resolution passed at a general meeting of that holding company.

Special exemptions for financial institutions

             (3)  A company’s taking security over shares (or units of shares) in itself or in a company that controls it is exempted from subsection (1) if:

                     (a)  the company’s ordinary business includes providing finance; and

                     (b)  the security is taken in the ordinary course of that business and on ordinary commercial terms.

             (4)  If a company acquires shares (or units of shares) in itself because it exercises rights under a security permitted by subsection (2) or (3), then, within the following 12 months, the company must cease to hold those shares (or units of shares). The ASC may extend this period of 12 months if the company applies for the extension before the end of the period.

             (5)  Any voting rights attached to the shares (or units of shares) cannot be exercised while the company continues to hold them.

             (6)  If, at the end of the 12 months (or extended period), the company still holds any of the shares (or units of shares), the company commits an offence for each day while that situation continues.

##### <a id="259C"></a>259C  Issuing or transferring shares to controlled entity

             (1)  The issue or transfer of shares (or units of shares) of a company to an entity it controls is void unless:

                     (a)  the issue or transfer is to the entity as a personal representative; or

                     (b)  the issue or transfer is to the entity as trustee and neither the company nor any entity it controls has a beneficial interest in the trust, other than a beneficial interest that satisfies these conditions:

                              (i)  the interest arises from a security given for the purposes of a transaction entered into in the ordinary course of business in connection with providing finance; and

                             (ii)  that transaction was not entered into with an associate of the company or an entity it controls; or

                     (c)  the issue to the entity is made as a result of an offer to all the members of the company who hold shares of the class being issued and is made on a basis that does not discriminate unfairly, either directly or indirectly, in favour of the entity; or

                     (d)  the transfer to the entity is by a wholly‑owned subsidiary of a body corporate and the entity is also a wholly‑owned subsidiary of that body corporate.

             (2)  The ASC may exempt a company from the operation of this section. The exemption:

                     (a)  must be in writing; and

                     (b)  may be granted subject to conditions.

             (3)  If paragraph (1)(c) or (d) applies to an issue or transfer of shares (or units of shares), section 259D applies.

##### <a id="259D"></a>259D  Company controlling entity that holds shares in it

             (1)  If any of the following occur:

                     (a)  a company obtains control of an entity that holds shares (or units of shares) in the company

                     (b)  a company’s control over an entity that holds shares (or units of shares) in the company increases

                     (c)  a company issues shares (or units of shares) to an entity it controls in the situation covered by paragraph 259C(1)(c)

                     (d)  shares (or units of shares) in the company are transferred to an entity it controls in the situation covered by paragraph 259C(1)(d);

then, within 12 months after it occurs either:

                     (e)  the entity must cease to hold the shares (or units); or

                      (f)  the company must cease to control the entity.

The ASC may extend this period of 12 months if the company applies for the extension before the end of the period.

             (2)  If this section applies to shares (or units of shares), it also applies to bonus shares issued in respect of those shares (or units of shares). Within the same period that applies to the shares themselves under subsection (1), either:

                     (a)  the entity must cease to hold the bonus shares; or

                     (b)  the company must cease to control the entity.

             (3)  Any voting rights attached to the shares (or units of shares) cannot be exercised while the company continues to control the entity.

             (4)  If, at the end of the 12 months (or extended period), the company still controls the entity and the entity still holds the shares (or units of shares), the company commits an offence for each day while that situation continues.

             (5)  This section does not apply to shares (or units of shares) if:

                     (a)  they are held by the entity as a personal representative; or

                     (b)  they are held by the entity as trustee and neither the company nor any entity it controls has a beneficial interest in the trust, other than a beneficial interest that satisfies these conditions:

                              (i)  the interest arises from a security given for the purposes of a transaction entered into in the ordinary course of business in connection with providing finance; and

                             (ii)  that transaction was not entered into with an associate of the company or an entity it controls.

             (6)  A contravention of this section does not affect the validity of any transaction.

##### <a id="259E"></a>259E  When a company controls an entity

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, a company controls an entity if the company has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the entity’s financial and operating policies.

             (2)  In determining whether a company has this capacity:

                     (a)  the practical influence the company can exert (rather than the rights it can enforce) is the issue to be addressed; and

                     (b)  any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the entity’s financial or operating policies is to be taken into account (even if it involves a breach of an agreement or a breach of trust).

             (3)  Merely because the company and an unrelated entity jointly have the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about another entity’s financial and operating policies, the company does not control the other entity.

             (4)  A company is not to be taken to control an entity merely because of a capacity that it is under a legal obligation to exercise for the benefit of someone other than its shareholders.

Note:          This situation could arise, for example, if the company holds shares as a trustee or is performing duties as a liquidator.

##### <a id="259F"></a>259F  Consequences of failing to comply with section 259A or 259B

             (1)  If a company contravenes section 259A or subsection 259B(1):

                     (a)  the contravention does not affect the validity of the acquisition or security or of any contract or transaction connected with it; and

                     (b)  the company is not guilty of an offence.

             (2)  Any person who is involved in a company’s contravention of section 259A or subsection 259B(1) contravenes this subsection.

Note:          Subsection (2) is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317DA).

## Part 2J.3—Financial assistance

##### <a id="260A"></a>260A  Financial assistance by a company for acquiring shares in the company or a holding company

             (1)  A company may financially assist a person to acquire shares (or units of shares) in the company or a holding company of the company only if:

                     (a)  giving the assistance does not materially prejudice:

                              (i)  the interests of the company or its shareholders; or

                             (ii)  the company’s ability to pay its creditors; or

                     (b)  the assistance is approved by shareholders under section 260B (that section also requires advance notice to the ASC); or

                     (c)  the assistance is exempted under section 260C.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), financial assistance may:

                     (a)  be given before or after the acquisition of shares (or units of shares); and

                     (b)  take the form of paying a dividend.

             (3)  Subsection (1) extends to the acquisition of shares (or units of shares) by:

                     (a)  issue; or

                     (b)  transfer; or

                     (c)  any other means.

##### <a id="260B"></a>260B  Shareholder approval

Approval by company’s own shareholders

             (1)  Shareholder approval for financial assistance by a company must be given by:

                     (a)  a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, with no votes being cast in favour of the resolution by the person acquiring the shares (or units of shares) or by their associates; or

                     (b)  a resolution agreed to, at a general meeting, by all ordinary shareholders.

Approval by shareholders of listed holding corporation

             (2)  If the company will be a subsidiary of a listed domestic corporation immediately after the acquisition referred to in section 260A occurs, the financial assistance must also be approved by a special resolution passed at a general meeting of that corporation.

Approval by shareholders in ultimate Australian holding company

             (3)  If, immediately after the acquisition, the company will have a holding company that:

                     (a)  is a domestic corporation but not listed; and

                     (b)  is not itself a subsidiary of a domestic corporation;

the financial assistance must also be approved by a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the body corporate that will be the holding company.

Information to accompany the notice of meeting

             (4)  A company or other body that calls a meeting for the purpose of subsection (1), (2) or (3) must include with the notice of the meeting a statement setting out all the information known to the company or body that is material to the decision on how to vote on the resolution. However, the company or body does not have to disclose information if it would be unreasonable to require the company or body to do so because the company or body had previously disclosed the information to its members.

Documents to be lodged with the ASC before notice of meeting is sent out

             (5)  Before the notice of a meeting for the purpose of subsection (1), (2) or (3) is sent to members of a company or other body, the company or body must lodge with the ASC a copy of:

                     (a)  the notice of the meeting; and

                     (b)  any document relating to the financial assistance that will accompany the notice of the meeting sent to the members.

             (6)  The company must lodge with the ASC, at least 14 days before giving the financial assistance, a notice in the prescribed form stating that the assistance has been approved under this section.

Lodgment of special resolutions

             (7)  A special resolution passed for the purpose of subsection (1), (2) or (3) must be lodged with the ASC by the company, listed domestic corporation or holding company within 14 days after it is passed.

##### <a id="260C"></a>260C  Exempted financial assistance

General exemptions based on ordinary course of commercial dealing

             (1)  Financial assistance is exempted from section 260A if it is given in the ordinary course of commercial dealing and consists of:

Special exemptions for financial institutions

                     (c)  the borrowing corporation is a borrowing corporation because it is or will be liable to repay the money; and

                     (d)  the guarantee or security is given by the company in the ordinary course of commercial dealing.

Special exemption for approved employee share schemes

             (4)  Financial assistance is exempted from section 260A if it is given under an employee share scheme that has been approved by:

                     (a)  a resolution passed at a general meeting of the company; and

                     (b)  if the company is a subsidiary of a listed domestic corporation—a resolution passed at a general meeting of the listed domestic corporation; and

                     (c)  if paragraph (b) does not apply but the company has a holding company that is a domestic corporation and that is not itself a subsidiary of a domestic corporation—a resolution passed at a general meeting of that holding company.

Other exemptions

             (5)  The following types of financial assistance are exempted from section 260A:

                     (a)  a reduction of share capital in accordance with Division 1 of Part 2J.1

                     (b)  a share buy‑back in accordance with Division 2 of Part 2J.1

                     (c)  assistance given under a court order

                     (d)  a discharge on ordinary commercial terms of a liability that the company incurred as a result of a transaction entered into on ordinary commercial terms.

##### <a id="260D"></a>260D  Consequences of failing to comply with section 260A

             (1)  If a company provides financial assistance in contravention of section 260A:

                     (a)  the contravention does not affect the validity of the financial assistance or of any contract or transaction connected with it; and

                     (b)  the company is not guilty of an offence.

             (2)  Any person who is involved in a company’s contravention of section 260A contravenes this subsection.

## Part 2J.4—Interaction with general directors’ duties

##### <a id="260E"></a>260E  General duties still apply

                   A director is not relieved from any of their duties under this Law (including section 232), or their fiduciary duties, in connection with a transaction merely because the transaction is authorised by a provision of this Chapter or is approved by a resolution of members under a provision of this Chapter.

##### <a id="334"></a>334  Accounting standards

AASB’s power to make accounting standards 

             (1)  The AASB may make accounting standards for the purposes of this Law. The standards must be in writing and must not be inconsistent with this law or the Regulations.

             (2)  Section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ of the Commonwealth applies to a standard made under subsection (1) as if it were a disallowable instrument for the purposes of that section.

Application of standards

             (3)  Accounting standards may:

                     (a)  be of general or limited application (including a limitation to specified bodies or undertakings); and

                     (b)  differ according to differences in time, place or circumstance.

             (4)  An accounting standard applies to:

                     (a)  periods ending after the commencement of the standard; or

                     (b)  periods ending on or after a later date specified in the standard.

             (5)  A company, registered scheme or disclosing entity may elect to apply the accounting standard to an earlier period unless the standard says otherwise. The election must be made in writing by the directors.

##### <a id="335"></a>335  Equity accounting

                   This Chapter (and, in particular, the provisions on consolidation of financial statements) does not prevent accounting standards from incorporating equity accounting principles.

##### <a id="336"></a>336  Comparative amounts

                   The accounting standards for the preparation of financial reports for a period may require the inclusion in those reports of comparative amounts for earlier periods.

##### <a id="337"></a>337  Interpretation of accounting standards

                   In interpreting an accounting standard, unless the contrary intention appears:

                     (a)  expressions used in the standard have the same meaning as they have in this Chapter; and

                     (b)  the provisions of Part 1.2 apply as if the standard’s provisions were provisions of this Chapter.

##### <a id="338"></a>338  Severing invalid provisions

                   If an accounting standard would otherwise have been interpreted as being inconsistent with this Law, the standard is nevertheless to be valid to the extent to which it is not inconsistent with this Law.

##### <a id="339"></a>339  Evidence of text of accounting standard

             (1)  This section applies to a document that purports to be published by or on behalf of the AASB or ASC and to set out the text of:

                     (a)  a specified standard as in force at a specified time under section 334; or

                     (b)  a specified provision of a standard of that kind.

It also applies to a copy of a document of that kind.

             (2)  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a document to which this section applies is proof in proceedings under the Corporations Law of this jurisdiction that:

                     (a)  the specified standard was in force at that time under that section; and

                     (b)  the text set out in the document is the text of the standard referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or the provision referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

## Part 2M.6—Exemptions and modifications

##### <a id="340"></a>340  ASC’s power to make specific exemption orders

             (1)  On an application made in accordance with subsection (3) in relation to a company, registered scheme or disclosing entity, the ASC may make an order in writing relieving any of the following from all or specified requirements of Parts 2M.2 and 2M.3:

                     (a)  the directors

                     (b)  the company, scheme or entity

                     (c)  the auditor.

Note:          For the criteria for making orders under this section, see section 342.

             (2)  The order may:

                     (a)  be expressed to be subject to conditions; and

                     (b)  be indefinite or limited to a specified period.

             (3)  The application must be:

                     (a)  authorised by a resolution of the directors; and

                     (b)  in writing and signed by a director; and

                     (c)  lodged with the ASC.

             (4)  The ASC must give the applicant written notice of the making, revocation or suspension of the order.

##### <a id="341"></a>341  ASC’s power to make class orders

                     (a)  directors

                     (b)  the companies, registered schemes or disclosing entities themselves

                     (c)  auditors of the companies, registered schemes or disclosing entities.

Note:          For the criteria for making orders under this section, see section 342.

             (2)  The order may:

                     (a)  be expressed to be subject to conditions; and

                     (b)  be indefinite or limited to a specified period.

             (3)  Notice of the making, revocation or suspension of the order must be published in the _Gazette_.

##### <a id="342"></a>342  Criteria for specific exemption orders and class orders

             (1)  To make an order under section 340 or 341, the ASC must be satisfied that complying with the relevant requirements of Parts 2M.2 and 2M.3 would:

                     (a)  make the financial report or other reports misleading; or

                     (b)  be inappropriate in the circumstances; or

                     (c)  impose unreasonable burdens.

             (2)  In deciding for the purposes of subsection (1) whether the audit requirements for a proprietary company, or a class of proprietary companies, would impose an unreasonable burden on the company or companies, the ASC is to have regard to:

                     (a)  the expected costs of complying with the audit requirements; and

                     (b)  the expected benefits of having the company or companies comply with the audit requirements; and

                     (c)  any practical difficulties that the company or companies face in complying effectively with the audit requirements (in particular, any difficulties that arise because a financial year is the first one for which the audit requirements apply or because the company or companies are likely to move frequently between the small and large proprietary company categories from one financial year to another); and

                     (d)  any unusual aspects of the operation of the company or companies during the financial year concerned; and

                     (e)  any other matters that the ASC considers relevant.

             (3)  In assessing expected benefits under subsection (2), the ASC is to take account of:

                     (a)  the number of creditors and potential creditors; and

                     (b)  the position of creditors and potential creditors (in particular, their ability to independently obtain financial information about the company or companies); and

                     (c)  the nature and extent of the liabilities of the company or companies.

##### <a id="343"></a>343  Modification by regulations

                   The regulations may modify the operation of this Chapter in relation to:

                     (a)  a specified company, registered scheme or disclosing entity; or

                     (b)  all companies, registered schemes or disclosing entities of a specified kind.

## Part 2M.7—Sanctions for contraventions of Chapter

##### <a id="344"></a>344  Contravention of Part 2M.2 or 2M.3

             (1)  A director of a company, registered scheme or disclosing entity contravenes this section if they fail to take all reasonable steps to comply with, or to secure compliance with, Part 2M.2 or 2M.3.

Note:          This section is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317DA).

##### <a id="345"></a>345  Deadline for lodging annual return

Companies

             (1)  A company must lodge an annual return with the ASC by 
 31 January each year, unless the ASC and the company agree to a different lodgment date (see subsection (3)).

Responsible entities of registered schemes

             (2)  The responsible entity of a registered scheme must lodge an annual return for the scheme with the ASC. The return for a scheme must be lodged within 3 months after the end of the scheme’s financial year unless the ASC and the responsible entity agree to a different lodgment date (see subsection (3)).

Agreed lodgment date

             (3)  The ASC and the company or the ASC and the responsible entity may agree to a different lodgment date. The agreement must be in writing and may cover 1 or more years. The annual return must be lodged by the agreed date.

Company’s obligation to lodge some notices ceases on lodgment of annual return

             (4)  A company’s obligation to lodge a notice under section 142, 146, 242 or 254X, ceases when:

                     (a)  the company lodges an annual return; and

                     (b)  the annual return sets out the information required by the notice.

This subsection does not affect the company’s liability for late lodgment fees incurred before the annual return is lodged or continuing offences committed before that time.

Note:          The ASC has a practice of sending out partly completed annual returns. The partly completed return may be used to comply with the obligation to lodge an annual return by correcting any information in it that is not accurate, completing the rest and lodging it with the ASC.

##### <a id="346"></a>346  Solvency resolution—companies

             (1)  Within 1 month before the annual return is lodged, the directors of a company must resolve whether, in their opinion, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the company will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to a company that has lodged a financial report of the company with the ASC under 
 Chapter 2M within 12 months before the annual return is lodged.

##### <a id="347"></a>347  Lodging annual return with ASC

                   An annual return may be lodged with the ASC:

                     (a)  in writing in the form approved by the ASC and signed in accordance with section 351; or

                     (a)  the liquidator is no longer acting; or

                     (b)  the company’s affairs have been fully wound up and a return that the liquidator should have lodged is at least 6 months late; or

                     (c)  the company’s affairs have been fully wound up under Part 5.4 and the company has no property or not enough property to cover the costs of obtaining a Court order for the company’s deregistration.

Deregistration procedure

             (3)  If the ASC decides to deregister a company under this section, it must give notice of the proposed deregistration:

                     (a)  to the company; and

             (5)  The ASC must give notice of the deregistration to everyone who was notified of the proposed deregistration under paragraph (3)(b) or (c).

##### <a id="601AC"></a>601AC  Deregistration—following amalgamation or winding up

             (1)  The ASC must deregister a company if the Court orders the deregistration of the company under:

                     (a)  paragraph 413(1)(d) (reconstruction and amalgamation of Part 5.1 bodies); or

##### <a id="601AD"></a>601AD  Effect of deregistration

Company ceases to exist

             (1)  A company ceases to exist on deregistration.

Note:          Despite the deregistration, officers of the company may still be liable for things done before the company was deregistered.

Company’s property vests in ASC

             (2)  On deregistration, all the company’s property vests in the ASC. If company property is vested in a liquidator immediately before deregistration, that property vests in the ASC. This subsection extends to property situated outside this jurisdiction.

             (3)  Under subsection (2), the ASC takes only the same property rights that the company itself held. If the company held particular property subject to a security or other interest or claim, the ASC takes the property subject to that interest or claim.

Note:          See also subsection 601AE(3)—which deals with liabilities that a law imposes on the property (particularly liabilities such as rates, taxes and other charges).

             (4)  The ASC has all the powers of an owner over property vested in it under subsection (2).

Note:          Section 601AF confers additional powers on the ASC to fulfil outstanding obligations of the deregistered company.

Company books to be kept by former directors

             (5)  The directors of the company immediately before deregistration must keep the company’s books for 3 years after the deregistration. This does not apply to books that a liquidator has to keep under subsection 542(2).

##### <a id="601AE"></a>601AE  What the ASC does with the property

             (1)  If property vested in the ASC under subsection 601AD(2) was held by the company on trust, the ASC may:

                     (a)  continue to act as trustee; or

                     (b)  apply to a court for the appointment of a new trustee.

Note:          Under paragraph (a), the ASC may be able to transfer the property to a new trustee chosen in accordance with the trust instrument.

             (2)  If the company did not hold the property on trust, the ASC may:

                     (a)  dispose of or deal with the property as it sees fit; and

                     (b)  apply any money it receives to:

                              (i)  defray expenses incurred by the ASC in exercising its powers in relation to the company under this Chapter; and

                             (ii)  make payments authorised by subsection (3).

The ASC must deal with the rest (if any) under Part 9.7.

Obligations attaching to property

             (3)  The property remains subject to all liabilities imposed on the property under a law and does not have the benefit of any exemption that the property might otherwise have because it is vested in the ASC. These liabilities include a liability that:

                     (a)  is a charge or claim on the property; and

                     (b)  arises under a law that imposes rates, taxes or other charges.

             (4)  The ASC’s obligation under subsection (3) is limited to satisfying the liabilities out of the company’s property to the extent that the property is properly available to satisfy those liabilities.

Accounts

             (5)  The ASC must keep:

                     (a)  a record of property that it knows is vested in it under this Chapter; and

                     (b)  a record of its dealings with that property; and

                     (c)  accounts of all money received from those dealings; and

                     (d)  all accounts, vouchers, receipts and papers relating to the property and that money.

##### <a id="601AF"></a>601AF  ASC’s power to fulfil outstanding obligations of deregistered company

                   The ASC may do an act on behalf of the company or its liquidator if the ASC is satisfied that the company or liquidator would be bound to do the act if the company still existed.

Note:          This power is a general one and is not limited to acts in relation to property vested in the ASC under subsection 601AD(2). The ASC has all the powers that automatically flow from the vesting of property in the ASC under that subsection (see subsection 601AD(4)) and may exercise _those_ powers whether or not the company was bound to do so. 

##### <a id="601AG"></a>601AG  Claims against insurers of deregistered company

                   A person may recover from the insurer of a company that is deregistered an amount that was payable to the company under the insurance contract if:

                     (a)  the company had a liability to the person; and

                     (b)  the insurance contract covered that liability immediately before deregistration.

##### <a id="601AH"></a>601AH  Reinstatement

Reinstatement by ASC

             (1)  The ASC may reinstate the registration of a company if the ASC is satisfied that the company should not have been deregistered.

Reinstatement by Court

             (2)  The Court may make an order that the ASC reinstate the registration of a company if:

                     (a)  an application for reinstatement is made to the Court by:

                              (i)  a person aggrieved by the deregistration; or

                             (ii)  a former liquidator of the company; and

                     (b)  the Court is satisfied that it is just that the company’s registration be reinstated.

             (3)  If the Court makes an order under subsection (2), it may:

                     (a)  validate anything done between the deregistration of the company and its reinstatement; and

                     (b)  make any other order it considers appropriate.

Note:          For example, the Court may direct the ASC to transfer to another person property vested in the ASC under subsection 601AD(2).

ASC to give notice of reinstatement

             (4)  The ASC must give notice of a reinstatement in the _Gazette_. If the ASC exercises its power under subsection (1) in response to an application by a person, the ASC must also give notice of the reinstatement to the applicant.

Effect of reinstatement

             (5)  If a company is reinstated, the company is taken to have continued in existence as if it had not been deregistered. A person who was a director of the company immediately before deregistration becomes a director again as from the time when the ASC or the Court reinstates the company. Any property of the company that is still vested in the ASC revests in the company. If the company held particular property subject to a security or other interest or claim, the company takes the property subject to that interest or claim.

##### <a id="601BN"></a>601BN  Liability of members on winding up

                   A person who stopped being a member of the body before it was registered as a company under this Part is to be treated as a past member of the company in applying Division 2 of Part 5.6 to a winding up of the company. However, the person’s liability to contribute to the company’s property is further limited by this section to an amount sufficient for the following:

## 17  After the heading to Part 2J.1 and before Division 1 of that Part

Insert:

##### 256A  Purpose

                   This Part states the rules to be followed by a company for reductions in share capital and for share buy‑backs. The rules are designed to protect the interests of shareholders and creditors by:

                     (a)  addressing the risk of these transactions leading to the company’s insolvency

                     (b)  seeking to ensure fairness between the company’s shareholders

                     (c)  requiring the company to disclose all material information.

## 18  Sections 256A to 256F (inclusive)

Repeal the sections, substitute:

##### 256B  Company may make reduction not otherwise authorised

             (1)  A company may reduce its share capital in a way that is not otherwise authorised by law if the reduction:

                     (a)  is fair and reasonable to the company’s shareholders as a whole; and

                     (b)  does not materially prejudice the company’s ability to pay its creditors; and

                     (c)  is approved by shareholders under section 256C.

A cancellation of a share for no consideration is a reduction of share capital, but paragraph (b) does not apply to this kind of reduction.

Note 1:       One of the ways in which a company might reduce its share capital is cancelling uncalled capital.

Note 2:       Sections 258A‑258F deal with some of the other situations in which reductions of share capital are authorised. Subsection 254K(2) authorises capital reductions involved in the redemption of redeemable preference shares and subsection 257A(2) authorises reductions involved in share buy‑backs.

Note 3:       For a director’s duty to prevent insolvent trading on reductions of share capital, see section 588G.

             (2)  The reduction is either an equal reduction or a selective reduction. The reduction is an **_equal reduction_** if:

                     (a)  it relates only to ordinary shares; and

                     (b)  it applies to each holder of ordinary shares in proportion to the number of ordinary shares they hold; and

                     (c)  the terms of the reduction are the same for each holder of ordinary shares.

Otherwise, the reduction is a **_selective reduction_**.

             (3)  In applying subsection (2), ignore differences in the terms of the reduction that are:

                     (a)  attributable to the fact that shares have different accrued dividend entitlements; or

                     (b)  attributable to the fact that shares have different amounts unpaid on them; or

                     (c)  introduced solely to ensure that each shareholder is left with a whole number of shares.

##### 256C  Shareholder approval

Ordinary resolution required for equal reduction

             (1)  If the reduction is an equal reduction, it must be approved by a resolution passed at a general meeting of the company.

Special shareholder approval for selective reduction

             (2)  If the reduction is a selective reduction, it must be approved by either:

                     (a)  a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, with no votes being cast in favour of the resolution by any person who is to receive consideration as part of the reduction or whose liability to pay amounts unpaid on shares is to be reduced, or by their associates; or

                     (b)  a resolution agreed to, at a general meeting, by all ordinary shareholders.

If the reduction involves the cancellation of shares, the reduction must also be approved by a special resolution passed at a meeting of the shareholders whose shares are to be cancelled.

             (3)  The company must lodge with the ASC a copy of any resolution under subsection (2) within 14 days after it is passed. The company must not make the reduction until 14 days after lodgment.

Information to accompany the notice of meeting

             (4)  The company must include with the notice of the meeting a statement setting out all information known to the company that is material to the decision on how to vote on the resolution. However, the company does not have to disclose information if it would be unreasonable to require the company to do so because the company had previously disclosed the information to its shareholders.

Documents to be lodged with the ASC

             (5)  Before the notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders, the company must lodge with the ASC a copy of:

                     (a)  the notice of the meeting; and

                     (b)  any document relating to the reduction that will accompany the notice of the meeting sent to shareholders.

##### 256D  Consequences of failing to comply with section 256B

             (1)  The company must not make the reduction unless it complies with subsection 256B(1).

             (2)  If the company contravenes subsection (1):

                     (a)  the contravention does not affect the validity of the reduction or of any contract or transaction connected with it; and

                     (b)  the company is not guilty of an offence.

             (3)  Any person who is involved in a company’s contravention of subsection (1) contravenes this subsection.

Note:          Subsection (3) is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317DA).

##### 256E  Signposts to other relevant provisions

                   The following table lists other provisions of this Law that are relevant to reductions in share capital.

##### <a id="1444"></a>1444  Share capital—application of new no par value rule to shares issued before commencement

                   Section 254C of the new Law applies to shares issued before commencement as well as shares issued after commencement.

##### <a id="1445"></a>1445  Share capital—references to amount paid on shares issued before commencement

                   For the purposes of the operation of this Law after commencement in relation to a share issued before commencement:

(a)  the amount paid on the share is the sum of all amounts paid to the company at any time for the share (but not including any premium); and

(b)  the amount unpaid on the share is the difference between the issue price of the share (but not including any premium) and the amount paid on the share (see paragraph (a)).

##### <a id="1446"></a>1446  Share capital—transfer of money in share premium account and capital redemption reserve into the share capital account

                   Immediately after commencement, any amount standing to the credit of the company’s share premium account and capital redemption reserve becomes part of the company’s share capital.

##### <a id="1447"></a>1447  Share capital—use of amount standing to credit of share premium account 

                   A company may use the amount standing to the credit of its share premium account immediately before commencement to:

(a)  provide for the premium payable on redemption of debentures or redeemable preference shares issued before commencement; or

(b)  write off:

                              (i)  the preliminary expenses of the company incurred before commencement; or

                             (ii)  expenses incurred, payments made, or discounts allowed, on or before commencement, in respect of any issue of shares in, or debentures of, the company.

Note:          After commencement, a company will be able to issue bonus shares without transferring an amount to the share capital account (see section 254A).

##### <a id="1448"></a>1448  Share capital—calls on partly‑paid shares

                   The liability of a shareholder for calls in respect of money unpaid on shares issued before commencement (whether on account of the par value of the shares or by way of premium) is not affected by the share ceasing to have a par value.

##### <a id="1449"></a>1449  Share capital—references in pre‑commencement contracts and other documents to par value 

             (1)  This section applies for the purpose of interpreting and applying after commencement:

(a)  a contract entered into before commencement (including a company’s constitution); or

(b)  a trust deed or other document executed before commencement.

             (2)  A reference to the par value of a share is taken to be a reference to:

                     (a)  if the share is issued before commencement—the par value of the share immediately before commencement; or

                     (b)  if the share is issued after commencement but shares of the same class were on issue immediately before commencement—the par value that the share would have had if it had been issued then; or

                     (c)  if the share is issued after commencement and shares of the same class were not on issue immediately before commencement—the par value determined by the directors.

A reference to share premium is taken to be a reference to any residual share capital in relation to the share.

             (3)  A reference to a right to a return of capital on a share is taken to be a reference to a right to a return of capital of a value equal to the amount paid in respect of the share’s par value.

             (4)  A reference to the aggregate par value of the company’s issued share capital is taken to be a reference to that aggregate as it existed immediately before commencement and:

                     (a)  increased to take account of the par value of any shares issued after commencement; and

                     (b)  reduced to take account of the par value of any shares cancelled after commencement.

##### <a id="1450"></a>1450  Share capital—previous Law continues to apply to capital reductions initiated before commencement

                   If a company has called a meeting before commencement for the purpose of section 256A of the old Law to consider a special resolution for a reduction of its share capital, the old Law continues to apply to the reduction of capital.
