USER’S GUIDE

                   This Guide aims to give a general overview of the operation and organisation of this Act.

The operation of the Act

                   The Act imposes Customs duty on goods imported into Australia.

                   To work out the duty payable on particular goods reference must be made to a Principal Tariff that is set out in Schedule 3\. This tariff classifies goods in accordance with Australia’s international obligations as a party to the World Trade Organization Agreement.

Note:          The text of the Agreement is set out in Australian Treaty Series 1995 No. 8\. In 2004 this was available in the Australian Treaties Library of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, accessible on the Internet through that Department’s world-wide web site.

                   The rate of duty applicable to particular goods is determined by the classification to which those goods belong and, in most cases, by reference to Schedule 3\. However, the rate of duty for US originating goods is determined under Schedule 5, the rate of duty for Thai originating goods is determined under Schedule 6, the rate of duty for Chilean originating goods is determined under Schedule 7 and the rate of duty for ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand (AANZ) originating goods is determined under Schedule 8.

                   Under Schedule 4, goods imported into Australia in specified circumstances, including goods imported for use by particular persons or bodies or in particular industries, may be subject to a lesser rate of duty than the nominal rate applying under Schedule 3, 5, 6, 7 or 8.

                   Rates of duty under Schedules 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and concessional rates of duty under Schedule 4, may vary according to the date of importation of the goods concerned, the country or place from which the goods are imported, or both of these circumstances.

The organisation of the Act

                   The Act consists of 3 Parts and 8 Schedules.

                   Part 1 deals with key concepts required for an understanding of the organisation and operation of the Customs Tariff.

                   Part 2 imposes Customs duty and sets out the method for working out the duty that is payable in respect of particular goods.

                   Part 3 includes a regulation making power, repeals the _Customs Tariff Act 1987_ with effect from 1 July 1996 and provides details of its final operation.

                   Schedule 1 sets out the countries and places to which special rates of duty apply under the Australian system of tariff preferences.

                   Schedule 2 sets out the general rules of interpretation for deciding the tariff classification within the Principal Tariff to which goods belong.

                   Schedule 3 sets out the Principal Tariff.

                   Schedule 4 identifies classes of goods to which concessional rates may apply and specifies the concessional rates of duty potentially applicable to such classes.

                   Schedule 5 sets out the rate of duty for US originating goods.

                   Schedule 6 sets out the rate of duty for Thai originating goods.

                   Schedule 7 sets out the rate of duty for Chilean originating goods.

                   Schedule 8 sets out the rate of duty for ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand (AANZ) originating goods.

             (2)  In applying subsection (1) to item 3 of the table, the quantity applicable for a calendar year applies to the sum of the quantities of the following goods imported in that year:

                     (a)  Thai originating goods classified to subheading 2009.41.00;

                     (b)  Thai originating goods classified to subheading 2009.49.00.

Example:    In 2005 the quantity applicable under item 3 of the table is 2,080,116 litres.

On 1 August 2005, 1,500,000 litres of Thai originating goods classified to subheading 2009.41.00 have been imported into Australia and 580,117 litres of Thai originating goods classified to subheading 2009.49.00 have been imported into Australia.

On 1 August 2005 the quantity is exceeded and the Agricultural Minister may publish a notice covering both kinds of goods.

Content of notice

             (3)  The notice must specify:

                     (a)  the safeguard goods; and

                     (b)  that the quantity of the goods imported into Australia during the applicable calendar year exceeds the quantity applicable for that year.

The notice may contain any other information that the Agricultural Minister considers appropriate.

             (4)  A notice under this section may specify one or more safeguard goods.

Duty rates

             (5)  Despite subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, if:

                     (b)  any safeguard goods specified in the notice are imported into Australia during the period beginning on the day after the publication day and ending on 31 December of the calendar year concerned;

then the duty in respect of the goods must be worked out by reference to the general rate set out in the third column of the tariff classification under which the goods are classified (and not under paragraph 16(1)(l) of this Act).

             (6)  Subsection (5) does not apply to goods exported from Thailand on or before the publication day under a contract entered into on or before the publication day. However, the quantity of those goods must be counted towards the quantity applicable for the next calendar year in relation to goods of that kind.

             (2)  If, under the provisions of subsection (1), the rate of duty payable on goods is increased on a particular day, that rate is payable on goods entered for home consumption on and from that day.

             (3)  If, under the provisions of subsection (1), the rate of duty payable on goods is increased on a particular day, the Chief Executive Officer must, on or as soon as practicable after that day, publish for the information of the public a notice in the _Gazette_ advertising the increased rate and the goods to which that rate is to apply.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Duty where goods consist of certain containers and certain contents

                   If:

                     (a)  goods consist of a container and the contents of the container; and

                     (b)  those contents would, if they were manufactured or produced in Australia, be subject to duty of Excise under the _Excise Tariff Act 1921_; and

                     (c)  under the Interpretation Rules, the tariff classification under which the goods are classified is the tariff classification under which the container would be classified if it were imported separately;

the duty in respect of the goods is equal to the sum of the amount of the duty that would be payable in respect of the container if it were imported separately and the amount of the duty that would be payable in respect of the contents if they were imported separately.

## Part 3—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="20A"></a>20A  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Repeal of the _Customs Tariff Act 1987_ etc.

             (1)  The _Customs Tariff Act 1987_ is repealed.

             (2)  Despite the fact that goods were imported into Australia before 1 July 1996, duties of Customs are not payable in respect of those goods under an Act repealed by this Act if duties of Customs are imposed on those goods by section 15.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the _Customs Tariff Act 1987_ as in force immediately before 1 July 1996 is taken to have been amended in accordance with Customs Tariff Proposals introduced into the House of Representatives in 1995 or 1996.

             (4)  If, before 1 July 1996, either House of the Parliament, under a motion on notice, passes a resolution that subsection (3) is not to apply to particular Customs Tariff Proposals referred to in that subsection and specified in the resolution, that subsection does not apply to the Proposals so specified.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Transitional

                   Despite section 15, if:

                     (a)  goods were imported into Australia, and first entered for home consumption, before 1 July 1996; and

                     (b)  the goods are again entered for home consumption on or after that day so that duties of Customs are imposed on the goods under section 15; and

                     (c)  because of section 132 of the _Customs Act 1901_, the rate of duty in respect of the goods is the rate in force when the goods were first entered for home consumption;

the duty in respect of the goods is the duty that would have been payable in respect of the goods if this Act had not been enacted.

# Schedule 2—General rules for the interpretation of Schedule 3

_Section 7_

                   Classification of goods in Schedule 3 shall be governed by the following principles:

              1.  The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes and, provided such headings or Notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions:

2.    (a)   Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this Rule), presented unassembled or disassembled.

                     (b)  Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of Rule 3.

              3.  When by application of Rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are, _prima facie_, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:

                     (a)  The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods.

                     (b)  Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.

                     (c)  When goods cannot be classified by reference to 3(a) or 3(b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.

              4.  Goods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above Rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.

              5.  In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following Rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein:

                     (a)  Camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. This Rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character;

                     (b)  Subject to the provisions of Rule 5(a) above, packing materials and packing containers presented with the goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use.

              6.  For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related Subheading Notes and, mutatis mutandis, to the above Rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this Rule the relative Section and Chapter Notes also apply, unless the context otherwise requires.
