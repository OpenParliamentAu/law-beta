             (1)  A cheque is an unconditional order in writing that:

                     (a)  is addressed by a person to another person (being a bank);

                     (b)  is signed by the person giving it; and

                     (c)  requires the bank to pay on demand a sum certain in money.

             (2)  An instrument that does not comply with subsection (1), or that orders any act to be done in addition to the payment of money, is not a cheque.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Order to pay

An order to pay must be more than an authorization or request to pay.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Unconditional order to pay

             (1)  An order to pay on a contingency is not an unconditional order to pay and the happening of the event does not make the order an unconditional order to pay.

             (2)  An order to pay shall not be taken not to be an unconditional order to pay by reason only that the order is coupled with either or both of the following:

                     (a)  an indication of a particular account to be debited by the bank to which the order is addressed;

                     (b)  a statement of the transaction giving rise to the order.

                     (b)  the order is addressed to one bank only; and

                     (c)  the bank is named, or otherwise indicated with reasonable certainty, in the instrument containing the order.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Order to pay on demand

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), an order to pay is an order to pay on demand if:

                     (b)  no time for payment is expressed in the instrument containing the order.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), an order to pay is not an order to pay on demand if the order is expressed to require, or requires by implication, payment only:

                     (a)  at or before a particular time; or

                     (b)  where the instrument containing the order is presented at or before a particular time.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Order to pay a sum certain

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), an order to pay is not an order to pay a sum certain unless the sum ordered to be paid is specified with reasonable certainty in the instrument containing the order.

             (2)  Where more than one sum is expressed to be payable in an instrument containing an order to pay, the lesser or least, as the case may be, of the sums so expressed to be payable shall be taken to be the only sum ordered to be paid by the instrument.

             (3)  An order to pay may be an order to pay a sum certain notwithstanding that the order requires a sum to be paid according to a rate of exchange specified in, or to be ascertained as directed by, the instrument containing the order.

             (4)  Where an instrument contains:

                     (a)  an order to pay a specified sum; and

                     (b)  an order to pay not more than a specified sum;

the instrument shall be taken to require payment of the lesser of the sums so specified.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Date of cheque etc.

             (1)  Where a cheque, or any indorsement of a cheque, is dated, the date shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be the day on which the cheque was drawn or the indorsement made, as the case may be.

             (2)  A cheque is not invalid by reason only that:

                     (a)  it is not dated;

                     (c)  the date it bears is a Sunday.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Inchoate instruments

             (1)  Where the drawer of an instrument that is signed, but is otherwise wanting in a material particular necessary for the instrument to be, on its face, a complete cheque, delivers the instrument to another person in order that the instrument may be filled up as a complete cheque, any person in possession of the instrument shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have authority to fill up the instrument as a complete cheque in any way the person sees fit.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (4), an instrument to which subsection (1) applies is not enforceable against the drawer or a person who becomes an indorser of the instrument before the instrument is filled up as a complete cheque unless the instrument is filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.

             (3)  Reasonable time, for the purposes of subsection (2), is a question of fact.

             (4)  An instrument of the kind referred to in subsection (1) that has been filled up as a complete cheque shall, as regards a holder in due course, be conclusively presumed:

                     (a)  to have been delivered to another person in order that the instrument might be filled up as a complete cheque; and

                     (b)  to have been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Meaning of specification of person in cheque as payee or indorsee

                     (b)  is not a fictitious or non-existing person.

             (2)  Where the holder for the time being of an office is specified in a cheque as payee or indorsee, the person who is the holder for the time being of the office shall be taken to be named in the cheque as payee or indorsee, as the case may be.

A cheque is either payable to order or payable to bearer.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Cheques payable to order

                     (a)  a person specified in the cheque as payee or indorsee; or

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Conversion of cheque payable to bearer into cheque payable to order

             (1)  Where a cheque, as drawn, is payable to bearer, the holder may convert the cheque into a cheque payable to order by:

             (2)  Where the only, or the last, indorsement of a cheque requires the drawee bank to pay the sum ordered to be paid by the cheque to bearer, the holder may, using the signature of the indorser, convert the cheque into a cheque payable to order by adding to, or altering, the indorsement so that the cheque is expressed to require the drawee bank to pay the sum ordered to be paid by the cheque to or to the order of, and only to or to the order of:

                     (a)  a person specified in the cheque as indorsee; or

Where a cheque is expressed, whether originally or by indorsement, to be payable to the order of a person specified in the cheque as payee or indorsee and not to or to the order of the person, the cheque is nevertheless payable to the person or to the person’s order, at the person’s option.

### Division 3—Delivery

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Delivery essential for drawing or indorsement

A contract arising out of the drawing or an indorsement of a cheque is incomplete and revocable until delivery of the cheque.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Requisites for effective delivery

The delivery of a cheque is not effective to complete a contract arising out of the drawing or an indorsement of the cheque unless the delivery is made by the drawer or indorser, as the case may be, in order to give effect to the drawing or indorsement, as the case may be.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Drawing or indorsement may be shown to be ineffective

Subject to section 28, the delivery of a cheque by the drawer or an indorser may be shown to have been conditional, or for a special purpose only, and not in order to issue the cheque or transfer it by negotiation, as the case may be.

##### <a id="28"></a>28   Presumption of effective delivery

             (1)  The drawer of a cheque shall:

                     (a)  as regards a holder in due course—be conclusively presumed to have made an effective delivery of the cheque so as to complete the drawer’s contract on the cheque; and

                     (a)  as regards a holder in due course:

                              (i)  where the holder in due course took the cheque from the indorser—be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have made an effective delivery of the cheque so as to complete the indorser’s contract on the cheque; or

             (4)  Where a cheque is indorsed by a person who does not have capacity or power to incur liability on a cheque, the indorsement is nevertheless effective as an indorsement of the cheque.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Signature essential to liability on cheque

             (1)  Subject to this section and section 75, a person is not liable as the drawer or an indorser of a cheque unless the person signs the cheque as the drawer or an indorser, as the case may be.

             (2)  Where a person signs a cheque in the person’s business name or trade name or in a name other than the person’s own name, the person is liable on the cheque as if the person had signed it in the person’s own name.

             (3)  The signature of the name of a firm on a cheque shall be deemed to be the signature, by the person signing, of the names of all persons liable as partners in the firm.

             (4)  Nothing in subsection (1) affects the liability, under any other law of the Commonwealth or under a law of a State or Territory, of a person who signs, issues or authorizes to be signed or issued on behalf of a company a cheque, or an indorsement on a cheque, on which the name of the company does not appear in legible characters.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Unauthorised signature

             (1)  Where a signature is written or placed on a cheque as that of the drawer without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant person_**), the signature is wholly inoperative as that of the relevant person unless:

                     (a)  the person against whom it is sought to assert a right on the cheque is estopped from denying the genuineness of the signature or the existence of authority for the signature, as the case requires; or

                     (b)  the signature is ratified or adopted by the relevant person;

but the signature operates as the signature of the person who wrote or placed it on the cheque in favour of any person who, in good faith and without notice that it had been written or placed on the cheque without the authority of the relevant person, pays the cheque or takes the cheque for value.

             (2)  Subject to sections 74 and 92, subsection 93(2), section 94 and subsections 95(1) and (3) and 98(1), where a signature is written or placed on a cheque otherwise than as that of the drawer without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant person_**), the signature is wholly inoperative as that of the relevant person unless:

                     (a)  the person against whom it is sought to assert a right on the cheque is estopped from denying the genuineness of the signature or the existence of authority for the signature, as the case requires; or

                     (b)  the signature is ratified or adopted by the relevant person;

but the signature operates as the signature of the person who wrote or placed it on the cheque in favour of any person who, in good faith and without notice that it had been written or placed on the cheque without the authority of the relevant person, pays the cheque or takes the cheque for value.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Person signing as agent or in representative capacity

                     (c)  the person for or on whose behalf the signer signs the cheque is named, or otherwise indicated with reasonable certainty, in the cheque;

the signer is not personally liable on the cheque.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_signer_**) signs a cheque and adds words to the signature indicating that the signer signs for or on behalf of a principal or in a representative capacity, but:

                              (i)  the signer does not in fact sign for or on behalf of the principal or in the representative capacity, as the case may be; or

                             (ii)  the person for or on whose behalf the signer signs the cheque is not named, or otherwise indicated with reasonable certainty, in the cheque; or

                     (b)  a person (in this subsection also referred to as the **_signer_**) signs a cheque and merely adds words to the signature describing the signer as an agent or as having a representative capacity;

the addition of those words does not prevent the signer from being personally liable on the cheque.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Procuration signature

Where an agent writes or places a signature by procuration on a cheque:

                     (a)  the signature operates as notice that the agent has only limited authority to sign for the agent’s principal; and

                     (b)  the principal is not bound by the signature unless the agent, in signing the cheque, acts within the limits of the agent’s actual authority.

### Division 6—Consideration

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Valuable consideration defined

             (1)  Valuable consideration for a cheque may be constituted by:

                     (a)  any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract; or

                     (b)  an antecedent debt or liability.

             (2)  An antecedent debt or liability may constitute valuable consideration for a cheque whether or not the cheque is post-dated.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Presumption of value

The drawer and each indorser of a cheque shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to have received value for the cheque.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Holder taking cheque for which value has been given

Where value has at any time been given for a cheque, the holder shall, as regards the drawer and indorsers who became indorsers before that time, be conclusively presumed to have taken the cheque for value.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Holder having lien

A holder of a cheque who has a lien on the cheque (whether arising from contract or by operation of law) shall, to the extent of the amount for which the holder has the lien, be conclusively presumed to have taken the cheque for value.

             (1)  Every cheque may be transferred by negotiation until it is discharged.

             (2)  Subsection (1) has effect in relation to a cheque notwithstanding anything written or placed on the cheque.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), the crossing of a cheque does not affect the transferability of the cheque by negotiation.

             (4)  Nothing in this section affects the transferability of a cheque otherwise than by negotiation.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Transfer of cheque by negotiation

             (1)  The transfer of a cheque by negotiation is the transfer of the cheque from the holder to another person in such manner as to constitute the other person the holder.

             (2)  An indorsement written or placed on an allonge to a cheque shall be taken to be written or placed, as the case may be, on the cheque.

             (3)  A mere signature on a cheque is, in point of form, sufficient for an indorsement of the cheque.

             (4)  Without limiting the generality of paragraph (1)(b), an indorsement of a cheque that purports to transfer a part only of the sum ordered to be paid by the cheque is not effective to transfer the cheque by negotiation.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Transfer of order cheque without indorsement

                     (b)  acquires the right to have the holder indorse the cheque to the other person.

             (2)  Without limiting the generality of subsection 17(2), where a person is under an obligation by virtue of subsection (1) to indorse a cheque as an agent or in a representative capacity, the person may indorse the cheque in terms negativing the person’s own liability on the cheque.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Indorsement of order cheque payable jointly to 2 or more persons

Where a cheque payable to order is expressed to require the drawee bank to pay the sum ordered to be paid by the cheque jointly to or to the order of 2 or more payees or indorsees who are not partners, all those persons must indorse the cheque in order to transfer the cheque by negotiation unless the person indorsing has, or the persons indorsing between them have, authority to sign for the person, or all the persons, not indorsing the cheque.
