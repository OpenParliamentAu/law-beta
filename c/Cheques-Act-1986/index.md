                     (a)  is addressed by a person to another person, being a financial institution; and

                     (b)  is signed by the person giving it; and

                     (c)  requires the financial institution to pay on demand a sum certain in money.

Note:          In this Act, **_financial institution_** has a restricted meaning—see the definition in subsection 3(1).

             (2)  An instrument that does not comply with subsection (1), or that orders any act to be done in addition to the payment of money, is not a cheque.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Order to pay

                   An order to pay must be more than an authorization or request to pay.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Unconditional order to pay 

             (1)  An order to pay on a contingency is not an unconditional order to pay and the happening of the event does not make the order an unconditional order to pay.

             (2)  An order to pay shall not be taken not to be an unconditional order to pay by reason only that the order is coupled with either or both of the following:

                     (a)  an indication of a particular account to be debited by the financial institution to which the order is addressed;

                     (b)  a statement of the transaction giving rise to the order.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Order addressed to a financial institution

             (1)  An order to pay is not addressed to a financial institution unless:

                     (a)  the order is addressed to a financial institution and to no other person;

                     (b)  the order is addressed to one financial institution only; and

                     (c)  the financial institution is named, or otherwise indicated with reasonable certainty, in the instrument containing the order.

             (2)  An order to pay may be an order to pay addressed to a financial institution notwithstanding that a person other than the financial institution on which the instrument containing the order is drawn, the payee or the drawer is specified in the instrument.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Order to pay on demand

             (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), an order to pay is an order to pay on demand if:

                     (a)  the order is expressed to require payment on demand, at sight or on presentation; or

                     (b)  no time for payment is expressed in the instrument containing the order.

             (2)  Subject to subsection 16(3), an order to pay is not an order to pay on demand if the order is expressed to require, or requires by implication, payment otherwise than on demand, at sight or on presentation.

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), an order to pay is not an order to pay on demand if the order is expressed to require, or requires by implication, payment only:

                     (a)  at or before a particular time; or

                     (b)  where the instrument containing the order is presented at or before a particular time.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Order to pay a sum certain

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), an order to pay is not an order to pay a sum certain unless the sum ordered to be paid is specified with reasonable certainty in the instrument containing the order.

             (2)  Where more than one sum is expressed to be payable in an instrument containing an order to pay, the lesser or least, as the case may be, of the sums so expressed to be payable shall be taken to be the only sum ordered to be paid by the instrument.

             (3)  An order to pay may be an order to pay a sum certain notwithstanding that the order requires a sum to be paid according to a rate of exchange specified in, or to be ascertained as directed by, the instrument containing the order.

             (4)  Where an instrument contains:

                     (a)  an order to pay a specified sum; and

                     (b)  an order to pay not more than a specified sum;

the instrument shall be taken to require payment of the lesser of the sums so specified.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Date of cheque etc.

             (1)  Where a cheque, or any indorsement of a cheque, is dated, the date shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to be the day on which the cheque was drawn or the indorsement made, as the case may be.

             (2)  A cheque is not invalid by reason only that:

                     (a)  it is not dated;

                     (b)  it is antedated or post‑dated; or

                     (c)  the date it bears is a Sunday.

             (3)  For the purpose of determining whether a post‑dated instrument is a cheque, the fact that the instrument is post‑dated shall be disregarded.

             (4)  A cheque is not incomplete or irregular on its face by reason only that it is post‑dated (whether or not the date has arrived).

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Optional stipulations

             (1)  The drawer of a cheque may, by an express stipulation written on the cheque, waive, as regards the drawer, the right to presentment of the cheque.

             (2)  An indorser of a cheque may, by an express stipulation written on the cheque:

                     (a)  negative or limit the indorser’s liability on the cheque; or

                     (b)  waive, as regards the indorser, the right to presentment of the cheque.

             (3)  A stipulation written on a cheque, being a stipulation of the kind referred to in subsection (1), shall not be taken to affect the rights, duties and liabilities of the drawer and the drawee institution in relation to one another.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Inchoate instruments

             (1)  Where the drawer of an instrument that is signed, but is otherwise wanting in a material particular necessary for the instrument to be, on its face, a complete cheque, delivers the instrument to another person in order that the instrument may be filled up as a complete cheque, any person in possession of the instrument shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have authority to fill up the instrument as a complete cheque in any way the person sees fit.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (4), an instrument to which subsection (1) applies is not enforceable against the drawer or a person who becomes an indorser of the instrument before the instrument is filled up as a complete cheque unless the instrument is filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.

             (3)  Reasonable time, for the purposes of subsection (2), is a question of fact.

             (4)  An instrument of the kind referred to in subsection (1) that has been filled up as a complete cheque shall, as regards a holder in due course, be conclusively presumed:

                     (a)  to have been delivered to another person in order that the instrument might be filled up as a complete cheque; and

                     (b)  is not a fictitious or non‑existing person.

             (2)  Where the holder for the time being of an office is specified in a cheque as payee or indorsee, the person who is the holder for the time being of the office shall be taken to be named in the cheque as payee or indorsee, as the case may be.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Cheques either payable to order or to bearer

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Cheques payable to order

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Cheques payable to bearer

### Division 3—Delivery

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Delivery essential for drawing or indorsement

                   A contract arising out of the drawing or an indorsement of a cheque is incomplete and revocable until delivery of the cheque.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Requisites for effective delivery

                   The delivery of a cheque is not effective to complete a contract arising out of the drawing or an indorsement of the cheque unless the delivery is made by the drawer or indorser, as the case may be, in order to give effect to the drawing or indorsement, as the case may be.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Drawing or indorsement may be shown to be ineffective

                   Subject to section 28, the delivery of a cheque by the drawer or an indorser may be shown to have been conditional, or for a special purpose only, and not in order to issue the cheque or transfer it by negotiation, as the case may be.

             (1)  The drawer of a cheque shall:

                     (a)  as regards a holder in due course—be conclusively presumed to have made an effective delivery of the cheque so as to complete the drawer’s contract on the cheque; and

                     (a)  as regards a holder in due course:

                              (i)  where the holder in due course took the cheque from the indorser—be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have made an effective delivery of the cheque so as to complete the indorser’s contract on the cheque; or

                     (b)  as regards a holder who is not a holder in due course—be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have made an effective delivery of the cheque so as to complete the indorser’s contract on the cheque.

             (3)  Nothing in this section affects the operation of subsection 18(1) or (4) in relation to an instrument of the kind referred to in that first‑mentioned subsection.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Delivery of cheque payable to bearer

                   Where the holder of a cheque payable to bearer delivers the cheque to another person (whether or not the holder also indorses the cheque), the delivery of the cheque is effective to transfer the cheque by negotiation, whether or not the holder delivered the cheque to the other person in order to transfer the cheque by negotiation.

### Division 4—Capacity

             (3)  Where a cheque is drawn or issued by a person who does not have capacity or power to incur liability on a cheque, the cheque is nevertheless a valid cheque.

             (4)  Where a cheque is indorsed by a person who does not have capacity or power to incur liability on a cheque, the indorsement is nevertheless effective as an indorsement of the cheque.

### Division 5—Signature

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Signature essential to liability on cheque

             (1)  Subject to this section and section 75, a person is not liable as the drawer or an indorser of a cheque unless the person signs the cheque as the drawer or an indorser, as the case may be.

             (2)  Where a person signs a cheque in the person’s business name or trade name or in a name other than the person’s own name, the person is liable on the cheque as if the person had signed it in the person’s own name.

             (3)  The signature of the name of a firm on a cheque shall be deemed to be the signature, by the person signing, of the names of all persons liable as partners in the firm.

             (4)  Nothing in subsection (1) affects the liability, under any other law of the Commonwealth or under a law of a State or Territory, of a person who signs, issues or authorizes to be signed or issued on behalf of a company a cheque, or an indorsement on a cheque, on which the name of the company does not appear in legible characters.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Unauthorised signature

             (1)  Where a signature is written or placed on a cheque as that of the drawer without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant person_**), the signature is wholly inoperative as that of the relevant person unless:

                     (a)  the person against whom it is sought to assert a right on the cheque is estopped from denying the genuineness of the signature or the existence of authority for the signature, as the case requires; or

                     (b)  the signature is ratified or adopted by the relevant person;

but the signature operates as the signature of the person who wrote or placed it on the cheque in favour of any person who, in good faith and without notice that it had been written or placed on the cheque without the authority of the relevant person, pays the cheque or takes the cheque for value.

             (2)  Subject to sections 74 and 92, subsection 93(2), section 94 and subsections 95(1) and (3) and 98(1), where a signature is written or placed on a cheque otherwise than as that of the drawer without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant person_**), the signature is wholly inoperative as that of the relevant person unless:

                     (a)  the person against whom it is sought to assert a right on the cheque is estopped from denying the genuineness of the signature or the existence of authority for the signature, as the case requires; or

                     (b)  the signature is ratified or adopted by the relevant person;

but the signature operates as the signature of the person who wrote or placed it on the cheque in favour of any person who, in good faith and without notice that it had been written or placed on the cheque without the authority of the relevant person, pays the cheque or takes the cheque for value.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Person signing as agent or in representative capacity

                     (c)  the person for or on whose behalf the signer signs the cheque is named, or otherwise indicated with reasonable certainty, in the cheque;

the signer is not personally liable on the cheque.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_signer_**) signs a cheque and adds words to the signature indicating that the signer signs for or on behalf of a principal or in a representative capacity, but:

                              (i)  the signer does not in fact sign for or on behalf of the principal or in the representative capacity, as the case may be; or

                             (ii)  the person for or on whose behalf the signer signs the cheque is not named, or otherwise indicated with reasonable certainty, in the cheque; or

                   (b)    a person (in this subsection also referred to as the **_signer_**) signs a cheque and merely adds words to the signature describing the signer as an agent or as having a representative capacity;

the addition of those words does not prevent the signer from being personally liable on the cheque.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Procuration signature

                   Where an agent writes or places a signature by procuration on a cheque:

                     (a)  the signature operates as notice that the agent has only limited authority to sign for the agent’s principal; and

                     (b)  the principal is not bound by the signature unless the agent, in signing the cheque, acts within the limits of the agent’s actual authority.

### Division 6—Consideration

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Valuable consideration defined

             (4)  Nothing in this section affects the transferability of a cheque otherwise than by negotiation.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Transfer of cheque by negotiation

             (1)  The transfer of a cheque by negotiation is the transfer of the cheque from the holder to another person in such manner as to constitute the other person the holder.

### Division 2—Dishonour

##### <a id="69"></a>69  Dishonour defined

                   A cheque is dishonoured if the cheque is duly presented for payment and payment is refused by the drawee institution, being a refusal that is communicated by the drawee institution to the holder or the person who presented the cheque on the holder’s behalf.

Note:          A cheque may be taken to be dishonoured in certain circumstances (see section 70A).

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Drawer and indorsers of cheque liable whether or not given notice of dishonour

### Division 3—Turnback of cheques drawn on failed financial institutions

##### <a id="70A"></a>70A  Certain cheques taken to be dishonoured

             (1)  A cheque that is lodged for collection with a financial institution that is not the drawee institution is taken to be dishonoured if the drawee institution becomes a failed financial institution:

                     (a)  after the cheque is lodged; and

                     (b)  at a time when the cheque has not been settled.

The dishonour is taken to occur at the time when the drawee institution becomes a failed financial institution.

Note 1:       For when the drawee institution becomes a failed financial institution, see subsection (2).

Note 2:       For when a cheque has not been settled, see subsections (3) and (4).

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, a drawee institution becomes a failed financial institution if, and only if:

                     (a)  the institution becomes a body corporate that is an externally administered body corporate within the meaning of the _Corporations Act 2001_ because the institution is, or is likely to become, insolvent; or

                     (b)  someone takes control of the institution’s property for the benefit of the institution’s creditors because the institution is, or is likely to become, insolvent; or

                     (c)  the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority:

                              (i)  appoints a person to investigate the affairs of the institution, takes control of the business of the institution or appoints an administrator to take control of the business of the institution under section 13A of the _Banking Act 1959_; and

                             (ii)  determines, in writing, that the institution is to be treated as a failed financial institution for the purposes of this Division.

                     (a)  it has not been exchanged for settlement under a settlement system that is recognised under subsection (4); or

                     (b)  it has been exchanged for settlement under a settlement system that is so recognised but the drawee institution’s liability in respect of the settlement for the exchange that includes the cheque has not been discharged under that system.

             (4)  The Reserve Bank of Australia may, by legislative instrument, determine that a settlement system is a recognised settlement system for the purposes of this section. The Reserve Bank of Australia is to take the public interest into account in determining that a settlement system is a recognised settlement system, and, in doing so, is to have regard to the rules that govern the system.

##### <a id="70B"></a>70B  Consequences of cheque being taken to be dishonoured

                   If a cheque that has been lodged with a financial institution (the **_collecting financial institution_**) for collection is taken to be dishonoured under section 70A (the **_deemed dishonour_**) then:

                     (a)  the deemed dishonour has the same consequences as if the cheque had been duly presented for payment and had been dishonoured in accordance with section 69; and

                     (b)  if the cheque has not been duly presented for payment, the requirement in section 66 to duly present the cheque for payment does not apply; and

                     (c)  if the collecting financial institution has made a provisional credit to an account in respect of the cheque, it may reverse that provisional credit; and

                     (d)  if the drawee institution has made a provisional debit to an account in respect of the cheque, the provisional debit is taken to be reversed, by force of this section, immediately after the deemed dishonour.
