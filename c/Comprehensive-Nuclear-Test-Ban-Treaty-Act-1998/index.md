<center>PREAMBLE</center>
 The States Parties to this Treaty (hereinafter referred to as "the States Parties"),
 <u>Welcoming</u> the international agreements and other positive measures of recent years in the field of nuclear disarmament, including reductions in arsenals of nuclear weapons, as well as in the field of the prevention of nuclear proliferation in all its aspects,
 <u>Underlining</u> the importance of the full and prompt implementation of such agreements and measures,
 <u>Convinced</u> that the present international situation provides an opportunity to take further effective measures towards nuclear disarmament and against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, and <u>declaring</u> their intention to take such measures,
 <u>Stressing</u> therefore the need for continued systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons, and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control,
 <u>Recognizing</u> that the cessation of all nuclear weapon test explosions and all other nuclear explosions, by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons, constitutes an effective measure of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects,
 <u>Further recognizing</u> that an end to all such nuclear explosions will thus constitute a meaningful step in the realization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament,
 <u>Convinced</u> that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear testing is through the conclusion of a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, which has long been one of the highest priority objectives of the international community in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation,
 <u>Noting</u> the aspirations expressed by the Parties to the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water to seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time,
 <u>Noting also</u> the views expressed that this Treaty could contribute to the protection of the environment,
 <u>Affirming</u> the purpose of attracting the adherence of all States to this Treaty and its objective to contribute effectively to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace and security,
 <u>Have agreed</u> as follows:

<center>ARTICLE I</center>
 <center>BASIC OBLIGATIONS</center>
 1.	Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such nuclear explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control.

 <center>PART III</center>
 <center>CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES</center>
 1.	Pursuant to Article IV, paragraph 68, each State Party shall, on a voluntary basis, provide the Technical Secretariat with notification of any chemical explosion using 300 tonnes or greater of TNT-equivalent blasting material detonated as a single explosion anywhere on its territory, or at any place under its jurisdiction or control.  If possible, such notification shall be provided in advance.  Such notification shall include details on location, time, quantity and type of explosive used, as well as on the configuration and intended purpose of the blast.
 2.	Each State Party shall, on a voluntary basis, as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Treaty provide to the Technical Secretariat, and at annual intervals thereafter update, information related to its national use of all other chemical explosions greater than 300 tonnes TNT-equivalent.  In particular, the State Party shall seek to advise:
 	(a)	The geographic locations of sites where the explosions originate;
 	(b)	The nature of activities producing them and the general profile and frequency of such explosions;
 	(c)	Any other relevant detail, if available; and
 to assist the Technical Secretariat in clarifying the origins of any such event detected by the International Monitoring System.
 3.	A State Party may, on a voluntary and mutually-acceptable basis, invite representatives of the Technical Secretariat or of other States Parties to visit sites within its territory referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.

<center>ANNEX 2 TO THE PROTOCOL</center>
 <center><u>List of Characterisation Parameters for International Data Centre Standard Event Screening</u></center>
 1.	The International Data Centre standard event screening criteria shall be based on the standard event characterisation parameters determined during the combined processing of data from all the monitoring technologies in the International Monitoring System.  Standard event screening shall make use of both global and supplementary screening criteria to take account of regional variations where applicable.
 2.	For events detected by the International Monitoring System seismic component, the following parameters,<u> inter alia</u>, may be used:
 -	location of the event;
 -	depth of the event;
 -	ratio of the magnitude of surface waves to body waves;
 -	signal frequency content;
 -	spectral ratios of phases;
 -	spectral scalloping;
 -	first motion of the P-wave;
 -	focal mechanism;
 -	relative excitation of seismic phases;
 -	comparative measures to other events and groups of events; and
 -	regional discriminants where applicable.
 3.	For events detected by the International Monitoring System hydroacoustic component, the following parameters, <u>inter alia</u>, may be used:
 -	signal frequency content including corner frequency, wide-band energy, and mean centre frequency and bandwidth;
 -	frequency-dependent duration of signals;
 -	spectral ratio; and
 -	indications of bubble-pulse signals and bubble-pulse delay.
 4.	For events detected by the International Monitoring System infrasound component, the following parameters, <u>inter alia</u>, may be used:
 -	signal frequency content and dispersion;
 -	signal duration; and
 -	peak amplitude.
 5.	For events detected by the International Monitoring System radionuclide component, the following parameters, <u>inter alia</u>, may be used:
 -	concentration of background natural and man-made radionuclides;
 -	concentration of specific fission and activation products outside normal observations; and
 -	ratios of one specific fission and activation product to another.
