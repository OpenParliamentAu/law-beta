                     (d)  the clarification inspection area had been declared to be an inspection area;

but with the national inspector, instead of an Organization inspector, exercising on‑site inspection powers.

             (2)  For the purposes of a particular clarification inspection, the rules in this Part that apply to an inspection by consent apply subject to any modifications set out in the regulations that the Director determines in writing are to apply to the clarification inspection.

             (1)  If the occupier of premises in an inspection area does not consent to an Organization inspector entering the premises and exercising on‑site inspection powers as mentioned in subsection 11(2), a national inspector must, as soon as possible, apply to a magistrate for an on‑site inspection warrant in relation to the premises.

             (2)  A magistrate may issue an on‑site inspection warrant in relation to the premises if the magistrate is satisfied, by information on oath or affirmation, that it is reasonably necessary to exercise on‑site inspection powers for an on‑site inspection purpose.

             (3)  On written application by the Director, the Minister may, in writing, extend the time limit in subsection (1) by a further period, or periods, of no more than 70 days in total.

             (4)  If the Minister does so, the Minister must give the occupier of the premises concerned a copy of the document extending the period and, if the inspection is carried out in whole or in part under a warrant, must also give a copy to the magistrate who issued the warrant.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Inspections not to be intrusive

                   An on‑site inspection or clarification inspection must be carried out in the way that is least intrusive consistent with achieving the purposes of the inspection.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  On‑site inspection warrant may authorise presence of an observer

                   An on‑site inspection warrant in relation to premises in an inspection area may, subject to any restrictions under section 15, authorise an observer to accompany an Organization inspector in his or her exercise of on‑site inspection powers for an on‑site inspection purpose.

                   After an initial briefing and to facilitate the more detailed inspection of premises under an on‑site inspection, the persons who are to do the inspection must prepare and give to the Director an initial inspection plan specifying the activities they propose to carry out and the places to which they want access.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Managed access

                   The persons who are to do the inspection must, in consultation with the Director, modify their inspection plan to whatever extent is justified, in accordance with the provisions relating to managed access in Part II of the Protocol to the Treaty, so as to ensure the protection of sensitive equipment, information and places that are not relevant to verifying compliance with the Treaty.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Other modifications of inspection plan

                   The persons who are to do the inspection may, at any time, otherwise modify the inspection plan to whatever extent is justified so as to ensure the effective execution of the inspection.

### Division 5—Offence‑related searches and seizures

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Offence‑related searches and seizures

             (1)  If a national inspector has reasonable grounds for suspecting that there may be on any premises particular evidential material, the inspector may:

                     (a)  with the consent of the occupier of the premises; or

                     (b)  under a warrant issued under section 31 or 37;

enter the premises and:

                     (c)  search the premises for the evidential material; and

                     (d)  if the inspector finds any evidential material on the premises—seize the evidential material found on the premises.

             (2)  A national inspector is not entitled to exercise any powers in the circumstances mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) in relation to premises if:

                     (a)  the occupier of the premises has required the inspector to show his or her identity card; and

                     (b)  the inspector fails to comply with the requirement.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Offence‑related warrants

             (1)  A national inspector may apply to a magistrate for a warrant under this section in relation to particular premises.

             (2)  A magistrate may issue a warrant to search premises if the magistrate is satisfied, by information on oath or affirmation, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or may be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material at the premises.

             (3)  However, a magistrate must not issue the warrant unless a national inspector has given the magistrate, either orally (on oath or affirmation) or by affidavit, any further information the magistrate requires about the grounds on which the warrant is being sought.

             (4)  A warrant issued under this Division must:

                     (a)  state the offence to which the warrant relates; and

                     (b)  describe the premises to which the warrant relates; and

                     (c)  describe the kinds of evidential material that are to be searched for under the warrant; and

                     (d)  state the name of the national inspector responsible for executing the warrant; and

                      (f)  state whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours.

             (5)  The warrant should also state that it authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind mentioned in paragraph (4)(c)) found at the premises that a member of the warrant team believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                     (a)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                     (b)  a thing relevant to another offence against this Act;

if the member believes, on reasonable grounds, that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence against this Act.

             (6)  Paragraph (4)(e) does not prevent the issue of successive warrants in relation to the same premises.

             (7)  If an application for the warrant is made under section 37, this section applies as if:

                     (a)  subsection (2) referred to 48 hours rather than 72 hours; and

                     (b)  paragraph (4)(e) referred to 48 hours rather than 7 days.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  The things that are authorised by a search warrant

             (1)  A warrant in force in relation to premises authorises the warrant team:

                     (a)  to enter the warrant premises and, if the premises are a conveyance, to enter the conveyance, whatever it is; and

                     (b)  to search the premises for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant, and to seize things of those kinds found at the premises; and

                     (c)  to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that a member of the warrant team believes on reasonable grounds to be:

                              (i)  evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

                             (ii)  evidential material in relation to another offence against this Act;

                            if the member of the warrant team believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence.

             (2)  If the warrant states that it may be executed only during particular hours, the warrant must not be executed outside those hours.

             (3)  If things are seized under a warrant, the warrant authorises the national inspector executing the warrant to make the things available to officers of other agencies if it is necessary to do so for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting an offence against this Act to which the things relate.

             (4)  A power mentioned in this section or in section 30, 33, 34 or 35 may only be exercised in a way that the national inspector believes, on reasonable grounds, to be in accordance with safety procedures applicable at the premises.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Specific powers available to warrant teams executing search warrants

             (1)  The warrant team may:

                     (a)  for a purpose incidental to the execution of the warrant; or

                     (a)  for not more than one hour; or

                     (b)  for a longer period if the occupier of the premises consents in writing.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the execution of a warrant is stopped by an order of a court; and

                     (b)  the order is later revoked or reversed on appeal; and

                     (c)  the warrant is still in force;

the execution of the warrant may be completed.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Use of equipment to examine or process things

             (1)  The warrant team may bring to the warrant premises any equipment reasonably necessary for examining or processing things found at the premises to see whether they may be seized under the warrant.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  it is not practicable to examine or process the things at the warrant premises; or

                     (b)  the occupier of the premises consents in writing;

the things may be moved to another place so that the examination or processing can be carried out.

             (3)  If things containing electronically stored information are moved to another place under subsection (2), the national inspector executing the warrant must, if practicable:

                     (a)  tell the occupier the place and the time at which the examination or processing will be carried out; and

                     (b)  allow the occupier or his or her representative to be present during the examination or processing.

             (4)  The warrant team may operate equipment already at the warrant premises to carry out the examination or processing of a thing found at the premises to see whether it may be seized under the warrant if a member of the warrant team believes, on reasonable grounds, that:

                     (a)  the equipment is suitable for the examination or processing; and

                     (b)  the examination or processing can be carried out without damage to the equipment or the thing.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Use of electronic equipment at premises

             (1)  A member of the warrant team may operate electronic equipment located at the premises to see whether evidential material is accessible by doing so if he or she believes, on reasonable grounds, that the operation of the equipment can be carried out without damage to the equipment.

             (2)  If a member of the warrant team finds, after operating the equipment, that evidential material is accessible by doing so, he or she may:

                     (a)  seize the equipment and any disk, tape or other associated device; or

                     (b)  if the material can, by using facilities at the premises, be put in documentary form—operate the facilities to put the material in that form and seize the documents so produced; or

                     (c)  if the material can be transferred to a disk, tape or other storage device that:

                              (i)  is brought to the premises; or

                             (ii)  is at the premises and the use of which for the purpose has been agreed to in writing by the occupier of the premises;

                            operate the equipment or other facilities to copy the material to the storage device and take the storage device from the premises.

             (3)  A person may seize equipment under paragraph (2)(a) only if:

                     (a)  it is not practicable to put the material in documentary form as mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) or to copy the material as mentioned in paragraph (2)(c); or

                     (b)  possession of the equipment by the occupier could constitute an offence against this Act.

             (4)  If a member of the warrant team believes, on reasonable grounds, that:

                     (a)  evidential material may be accessible by operating electronic equipment at the premises; and

                     (b)  expert assistance is required to operate the equipment; and

                     (c)  if he or she does not take action under this subsection, the material may be destroyed, altered or otherwise interfered with;

he or she may do whatever is necessary to secure the equipment, whether by locking it up, placing a guard or otherwise.

             (5)  The member of the warrant team must give notice to the occupier of the premises of his or her intention to secure the equipment and that the equipment may be secured for up to 24 hours.

             (6)  The equipment may be secured:

                     (a)  for a period of no more than 24 hours; or

                     (b)  until the equipment has been operated by the expert;

whichever happens first.

             (7)  If a member of the warrant team believes on reasonable grounds that the expert assistance will not be available within 24 hours, he or she may apply to the magistrate who issued the warrant for an extension of that period.

             (8)  The member must give notice to the occupier of the premises of his or her intention to apply for an extension, and the occupier may be heard in relation to the application.

             (9)  The provisions of this Division relating to the issue of warrants apply, with any necessary modifications, to the issuing of an extension.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Occupier may observe search

             (1)  If a warrant in relation to premises is being executed and the occupier of the premises is present, the occupier may observe the search being conducted.

             (2)  The right to observe ceases if the occupier impedes the search.

             (3)  This section does not prevent 2 or more areas of the premises being searched at the same time.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Warrants by telephone or other electronic means

             (1)  A national inspector may apply to a magistrate for a warrant by telephone, facsimile or other electronic means:

                     (a)  in an urgent case; or

                     (b)  if the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant.

             (2)  The magistrate may require voice communication to the extent that is practicable in the circumstances.

             (3)  An application under this section must include all information required to be provided in an ordinary application for a warrant, but the application may, if necessary, be made before the information is sworn or affirmed.

             (4)  If an application is made to a magistrate under this section and the magistrate, after considering the information and having received and considered any further information that the magistrate requires, is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a warrant in the terms of the application should be issued urgently; or

                     (b)  the delay that would occur if an application were made in person would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant;

the magistrate may complete and sign the same form of warrant that would be issued under section 31.

             (5)  If the magistrate decides to issue the warrant, the magistrate must tell the applicant, by telephone, facsimile or other electronic means, of the terms of the warrant and the day and time when it was signed.

             (6)  The national inspector must then complete a form of warrant in terms substantially the same as those given by the magistrate, stating on the form the name of the magistrate and the day and time when the warrant was signed.

             (7)  The national inspector must, not later than the day after the day of expiry of the warrant or the day after the day on which the warrant was executed, whichever is earlier, give or transmit to the magistrate the form of warrant completed by the inspector and, if the information mentioned in subsection (3) was not sworn or affirmed, that information duly sworn or affirmed.

             (8)  The magistrate must attach to the documents provided under subsection (7) the form of warrant completed by the magistrate.

             (9)  If:

                     (b)  the form of warrant signed by the magistrate is not produced in evidence;

the court is to assume, unless the contrary is proved, that the exercise of the power was not duly authorised.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Receipts for things seized or moved

                     (b)  the reason for its seizure no longer exists or it is decided that it is not to be used in evidence;

the person must return it, unless:

                     (c)  the thing is forfeited or forfeitable to the Commonwealth or is the subject of a dispute as to ownership; or

                     (d)  a court orders that it need not be returned.

             (2)  If a warrant team seizes a thing from a person under a warrant issued under section 31 or 37, 60 days after the seizure the warrant team must return the thing to the person (or to the owner, if the person is not entitled to possess it) unless:

                     (a)  the thing is forfeited or forfeitable to the Commonwealth or is the subject of a dispute as to ownership; or

                     (b)  proceedings in respect of which the thing may afford evidence were begun before the end of the 60 days and have not been completed (including an appeal to a court in relation to those proceedings); or

                     (c)  the warrant team may retain the thing because of an order under section 40; or

                     (d)  a member of the warrant team or another person is authorised (by a law, or an order of a court, of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory) to retain, destroy or dispose of the thing.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Court of summary jurisdiction may permit a thing to be retained

             (1)  If a thing is seized under a warrant issued under section 31 or 37, and:

                     (a)  before the end of 60 days after the seizure; or

                     (b)  before the end of a period previously specified in an order of a court under this section;

proceedings in respect of which the thing may afford evidence have not begun, a member of the warrant team may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an order that he or she may retain the thing for a further period.

             (2)  If the court is satisfied that it is necessary for the team to continue to retain the thing:

                     (a)  for the purposes of an investigation as to whether an offence against this Act has been committed; or

                     (b)  to enable evidence of such an offence to be secured for the purposes of a prosecution;

the court may order that the team may retain the thing for the period specified in the order.

             (3)  Before the court hears the application, it may require notice of the application to be given to such persons as the court thinks fit.

### Division 6—General rules about warrants

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Announcement before entry

             (1)  Before a warrant team enters premises in an inspection area or clarification inspection area, the national inspector executing the warrant must:

                     (a)  announce that the warrant team is authorised by the warrant to enter the premises; and

                     (b)  give any person at the premises an opportunity to allow entry into or onto the premises.

             (2)  The national inspector need not comply with subsection (1) if the national inspector believes, on reasonable grounds, that immediate entry to the premises is required to ensure that the effective execution of the warrant is not frustrated.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Availability of assistance and use of force in executing warrant

                   In the execution of a warrant:

                     (a)  the national inspector executing the warrant may obtain such assistance; and

                     (b)  the warrant team may use such force against persons and things;

as is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Details of warrant to be given to occupier etc.

                   If a warrant in relation to particular premises is being executed and the occupier of the premises is present at the premises, the national inspector executing the warrant must make a copy of the warrant available to the occupier.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Copies of seized things to be provided

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if a warrant team seizes under a warrant:

                     (a)  a document, film, computer file or other thing that can be readily copied; or

                     (b)  a storage device, the information in which can be readily copied;

the warrant team must, if the occupier of the premises requests, give a copy of the thing or the information to the occupier as soon as practicable after the seizure.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the thing was seized under paragraph 35(2)(a) or (b).

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Compensation for damage to equipment

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  damage is caused to an instrument or other equipment as a result of being operated as mentioned in paragraph 12(1)(n) or subsection 34(4) or 35(1); and

                     (b)  the damage was caused as a result of:

                              (i)  insufficient care being exercised in selecting the person who was to operate the equipment; or

                             (ii)  insufficient care being exercised by the person operating the equipment;

the Commonwealth must pay the person such reasonable amount of compensation:

                     (c)  as they agree on; or

                     (d)  failing agreement—as the Federal Court of Australia determines.

             (2)  In determining the amount of compensation payable under paragraph (1)(d), regard is to be had to whether the occupier of the premises, if he or she were available at the time, had given any warning or guidance as to the operation of the instrument or other equipment that was appropriate in the circumstances.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Making false statements in applications for warrant

                   A national inspector is guilty of an offence if the inspector makes, in an application for a warrant, a statement that the inspector knows to be false or misleading in a material particular.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Offences relating to telephone warrants

                   A national inspector is guilty of an offence if the inspector:

                     (a)  states in a document that purports to be a form of warrant issued under section 37 the name of a person as the magistrate issuing the warrant who is not the magistrate who issued the warrant; or

# Schedule 1—Comprehensive Nuclear‑Test‑Ban Treaty

_Note:       This is the copy of the Treaty referred to in the definition of Treaty in section 7 of this Act._

PREAMBLE

The States Parties to this Treaty (hereinafter referred to as “the States Parties”),

<u>Welcoming</u> the international agreements and other positive measures of recent years in the field of nuclear disarmament, including reductions in arsenals of nuclear weapons, as well as in the field of the prevention of nuclear proliferation in all its aspects,

<u>Underlining</u> the importance of the full and prompt implementation of such agreements and measures,

<u>Convinced</u> that the present international situation provides an opportunity to take further effective measures towards nuclear disarmament and against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, and <u>declaring</u> their intention to take such measures,

<u>Stressing</u> therefore the need for continued systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons, and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control,

<u>Recognizing</u> that the cessation of all nuclear weapon test explosions and all other nuclear explosions, by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons, constitutes an effective measure of nuclear disarmament and non‑proliferation in all its aspects,

<u>Further recognizing</u> that an end to all such nuclear explosions will thus constitute a meaningful step in the realization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament,

<u>Convinced</u> that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear testing is through the conclusion of a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test‑ban treaty, which has long been one of the highest priority objectives of the international community in the field of disarmament and non‑proliferation,

<u>Noting</u> the aspirations expressed by the Parties to the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water to seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time,

<u>Noting also</u> the views expressed that this Treaty could contribute to the protection of the environment,

<u>Affirming</u> the purpose of attracting the adherence of all States to this Treaty and its objective to contribute effectively to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace and security,

<u>Have agreed</u> as follows:

ARTICLE I

BASIC OBLIGATIONS

1.       Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such nuclear explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control.

56.     Each State Party shall permit the Organization to conduct an on‑site inspection on its territory or at places under its jurisdiction or control in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty and the Protocol.  However, no State Party shall have to accept simultaneous on‑site inspections on its territory or at places under its jurisdiction or control.

57.     In accordance with the provisions of this Treaty and the Protocol, the inspected State Party shall have:

(a)       The right and the obligation to make every reasonable effort to demonstrate its compliance with this Treaty and, to this end, to enable the inspection team to fulfil its mandate;

(b)       The right to take measures it deems necessary to protect national security interests and to prevent disclosure of confidential information not related to the purpose of the inspection;

(e)       The obligation not to impede the ability of the inspection team to move within the inspection area and to carry out inspection activities in accordance with this Treaty and the Protocol.

Access, in the context of an on‑site inspection, means both the physical access of the inspection team and the inspection equipment to, and the conduct of inspection activities within, the inspection area.

58.     The on‑site inspection shall be conducted in the least intrusive manner possible, consistent with the efficient and timely accomplishment of the inspection mandate, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Protocol.  Wherever possible, the inspection team shall begin with the least intrusive procedures and then proceed to more intrusive procedures only as it deems necessary to collect sufficient information to clarify the concern about possible non‑compliance with this Treaty.  The inspectors shall seek only the information and data necessary for the purpose of the inspection and shall seek to minimize interference with normal operations of the inspected State Party.

59.     The inspected State Party shall assist the inspection team throughout the on‑site inspection and facilitate its task.

60.     If the inspected State Party, acting in accordance with Part II, paragraphs 86 to 96 of the Protocol, restricts access within the inspection area, it shall make every reasonable effort in consultations with the inspection team to demonstrate through alternative means its compliance with this Treaty.

<u>Observer</u>

61.     With regard to an observer, the following shall apply:

Differing observations made by inspectors may be attached to the report.

63.     The Director‑General shall make draft inspection reports available to the inspected State Party.  The inspected State Party shall have the right to provide the Director‑General within 48 hours with its comments and explanations, and to identify any information and data which, in its view, are not related to the purpose of the inspection and should not be circulated outside the Technical Secretariat.  The Director‑General shall consider the proposals for changes to the draft inspection report made by the inspected State Party and shall wherever possible incorporate them.  The Director‑General shall also annex the comments and explanations provided by the inspected State Party to the inspection report.

64.     The Director‑General shall promptly transmit the inspection report to the requesting State Party, the inspected State Party, the Executive Council and to all other States Parties.  The Director‑General shall further transmit promptly to the Executive Council and to all other States Parties any results of sample analysis in designated laboratories in accordance with Part II, paragraph 104 of the Protocol, relevant data from the International Monitoring System, the assessments of the requesting and inspected States Parties, as well as any other information that the Director‑General deems relevant.  In the case of the progress inspection report referred to in paragraph 47, the Director‑General shall transmit the report to the Executive Council within the time‑frame specified in that paragraph.

(b)       Whether the right to request an on‑site inspection has been abused.

66.     If the Executive Council reaches the conclusion, in keeping with its powers and functions, that further action may be necessary with regard to paragraph 65, it shall take the appropriate measures in accordance with Article V.

<u>Frivolous or Abusive On‑Site Inspection Requests</u>

67.     If the Executive Council does not approve the on‑site inspection on the basis that the on‑site inspection request is frivolous or abusive, or if the inspection is terminated for the same reasons, the Executive Council shall consider and decide on whether to implement appropriate measures to redress the situation, including the following:

(a)       Requiring the requesting State Party to pay for the cost of any preparations made by the Technical Secretariat;

ANNEX 2 TO THE PROTOCOL

<u>List of Characterisation Parameters for International Data Centre Standard Event Screening</u>

1.       The International Data Centre standard event screening criteria shall be based on the standard event characterisation parameters determined during the combined processing of data from all the monitoring technologies in the International Monitoring System.  Standard event screening shall make use of both global and supplementary screening criteria to take account of regional variations where applicable.

2.       For events detected by the International Monitoring System seismic component, the following parameters, <u>inter alia</u>, may be used:

‑        location of the event;

‑        depth of the event;

‑        ratio of the magnitude of surface waves to body waves;

‑        signal frequency content;

‑        spectral ratios of phases;

‑        spectral scalloping;

‑        first motion of the P‑wave;

‑        focal mechanism;

‑        relative excitation of seismic phases;

‑        comparative measures to other events and groups of events; and

‑        regional discriminants where applicable.

3.       For events detected by the International Monitoring System hydroacoustic component, the following parameters, inter alia, may be used:

‑        signal frequency content including corner frequency, wide‑band energy, and mean centre frequency and bandwidth;

‑        frequency‑dependent duration of signals;

‑        spectral ratio; and

‑        indications of bubble‑pulse signals and bubble‑pulse delay.

4.       For events detected by the International Monitoring System infrasound component, the following parameters, <u>inter alia</u>, may be used:

‑        signal frequency content and dispersion;

‑        signal duration; and

‑        peak amplitude.

5.       For events detected by the International Monitoring System radionuclide component, the following parameters, <u>inter alia</u>, may be used:

‑        concentration of background natural and man‑made radionuclides;

‑        concentration of specific fission and activation products outside normal observations; and

‑        ratios of one specific fission and activation product to another.
