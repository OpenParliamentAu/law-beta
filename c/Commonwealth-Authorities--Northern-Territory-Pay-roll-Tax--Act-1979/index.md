                     (b)  that was registered as an employer under the pay‑roll tax law of a State or in respect of which an application for registration as an employer under the pay‑roll tax law of a State was pending,

immediately before the commencement of this Act.

                    <a name="pai-roll-tax-law"></a>**_pay‑roll tax law_**, in relation to the Commonwealth, a State or the Northern Territory, means a law of the Commonwealth, of the State or of the Northern Territory, as the case may be, that relates to the imposition, assessment and collection of a tax upon wages.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Act, an authority or body continued in existence by an Act shall be deemed to be constituted by that Act.

                     (b)  to the effect that the Commonwealth authority is not, except with respect to taxation of a kind specified in the Act, subject to taxation under a law of a State or Territory to which the Commonwealth is not subject, that provision does not have effect in relation to taxation under the pay‑roll tax law of the Northern Territory.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  the Act that constitutes or establishes a Commonwealth authority, being a Commonwealth authority subject to pay‑roll tax, contains a provision (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant provision_**) to the effect that:

                              (i)  except under a law specified in regulations made under the Act, the Commonwealth authority is not, under a law of a State or Territory, subject to taxation, or is not, under a law of a State or Territory, subject to taxation other than taxation of a kind specified in the Act; or
