                    <a name="director-report-rule"></a>**_directors’ reporting rule_** means section 9 or any of the requirements of Schedule 1 that impose obligations on the directors.

Those rules must also be used for other subsidiaries, so far as is practicable.

             (3)  The directors of the authority must give the report to the responsible Minister, together with a copy of the relevant subsidiary’s financial statements.

                              (i)  an Agency Head; or

Meaning of **wholly-owned****Commonwealth****company**

                     (a)  means proceedings for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (including proceedings under clause 4); and

                     (b)  does not include proceedings for an offence (except so far as the proceedings relate to the question whether the court should make an order under clause 4).

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  eligible proceedings are brought against a person; and

                     (b)  in the proceedings it appears to the court that the person has, or may have, contravened a civil penalty provision but that:

                              (i)  the person has acted honestly; and

                             (ii)  having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the person ought fairly to be excused for the contravention;

the court may relieve the person either wholly or partly from a liability to which the person would otherwise be subject, or that might otherwise be imposed on the person, because of the contravention.

             (3)  If a person thinks that eligible proceedings will or may be begun against them, they may apply to the Court for relief.

             (4)  On an application under subclause (3), the Court may grant relief under subclause (2) as if the eligible proceedings had been begun in the Court.

                     (a)  a reference in that subclause to the court is a reference to the judge; and

                     (b)  the relief that may be granted includes withdrawing the case in whole or in part from the jury and directing judgment to be entered for the defendant on such terms as to costs as the judge thinks appropriate.

             (2)  An officer of a Commonwealth authority who has reason to apprehend that a claim will or might be made against him or her for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty in a capacity as such an officer may apply to the Court for relief. On the application, the Court has the same power to relieve the officer as it would have had under subclause (1) if it had been a court before which proceedings against the officer for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty had been brought.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a case to which subclause (1) applies is being tried by a judge with a jury; and
