##### <a id="5"></a>5  Returns by employers

             (1)  A person who employs eligible employees at any time during a month that ends after the commencement of this Act must, within 28 days after the end of that month, make a return of the eligible wages paid by the person to those employees during that month.

                    Penalty:  $1,000.

             (2)  A return for the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  must be made:

                              (i)  if the Corporation has given written notice to the person who is required to make the return that a person specified in the notice is authorised, in lieu of the Corporation, to receive returns under this section—to the specified person in such manner as is prescribed by the regulations or, if there are no such regulations, as that person directs; or

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Extension of time and payment by instalments

             (1)  The Corporation may, in such circumstances as the Corporation thinks fit, extend the time for payment of an amount of levy for such period or periods as the Corporation determines, and, if the Corporation does so, the levy is payable accordingly.

             (2)  The Corporation may, in such circumstances as the Corporation thinks fit, permit the payment of an amount of levy to be made by instalments in such amounts and at such times as the Corporation determines, and, subject to subsection (3), each instalment is payable at the time so determined in relation to that instalment.

             (3)  If the Corporation permits the payment of an amount of levy to be made by instalments and an instalment of an amount of levy is not paid on or before the time for the due payment of the instalment, the whole of the amount outstanding becomes payable at that time.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="levi"></a>**_levy_** includes additional levy under section 7.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Additional levy

             (1)  If any levy remains unpaid on any day after the time when it became payable, or would apart from section 6 have become payable, additional levy is payable by way of penalty by the person liable to pay the levy, at the percentage applicable under subsection (2) in respect of that day, on the amount unpaid, computed from that time or, if under section 6 the Corporation has granted an extension of time for payment of the levy or has permitted payment of the levy to be made by instalments, from such date as the Corporation determines, not being a date before the date on which the levy was originally payable.

             (2)  The percentage applicable in respect of a day is 2 percentage points above the maximum indicator interest rate for that day, where:

                    <a name="maximum-indic-interest-rate"></a>**_maximum indicator interest rate_**, in relation to a day, means the higher or the highest, as the case may be, of the range of rates of interest per annum current on that day quoted by the Reserve Bank, on the basis of reports by each bank regarded by the Reserve Bank as a major trading bank operating in Australia, in respect of overdrafts of $100,000 or more.

             (3)  If judgment is given by, or entered in, a court for payment of:

                     (a)  an amount of levy; or

                     (b)  an amount that includes an amount of levy;

then:

                     (c)  the levy is not taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to have ceased to be payable merely because of the giving or entering of the judgment; and

                     (d)  if the judgment debt carries interest, the additional levy that would, apart from this paragraph, be payable under this section in relation to the levy is, by force of this paragraph, reduced by:

                              (i)  in a case to which paragraph (a) applies—the amount of the interest; or

                             (ii)  in a case to which paragraph (b) applies—the amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Remission of additional levy

             (1)  If additional levy is payable by a person under section 7 in relation to an amount of levy, the person may request the Corporation in writing to remit the additional levy or a part of the additional levy.

             (2)  If such a request is made and:

                     (a)  the Corporation is satisfied that:

                              (i)  the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment of the levy were not due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person; and

                             (ii)  the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances; or

                     (b)  the Corporation is satisfied that: 

                              (i)  the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment of the levy were due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person; and

                             (ii)  the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances; and

                            (iii)  having regard to the nature of those circumstances, it would be fair and reasonable to remit the additional levy or part of the additional levy; or

                     (c)  the Corporation is satisfied that there are special circumstances because of which it would be fair and reasonable to remit the additional levy or part of the additional levy;

the Corporation may remit the additional levy or part of the additional levy.

             (3)  The Corporation must give to the person who made the request written notice of the Corporation’s decision on the request.

             (4)  If the Corporation does not make a decision on the request within 30 days after the request is made, the Corporation is taken for the purposes of this section to have made a decision refusing the request.

             (5)  Notice of the Corporation’s decision on a request must include a statement to the effect that:

                     (a)  subject to the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, application may be made by or on behalf of the person who made the request to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision; and

                     (b)  except where subsection 28(4) of that Act applies, application may be made in accordance with section 28 of that Act by or on behalf of that person for a statement in writing setting out the findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based and giving the reasons for the decision.

             (6)  A failure to comply with a requirement of subsection (5) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

             (7)  Subject to the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by a person who has made a request under subsection (1) for review of a decision by the Corporation on the request.

             (8)  In subsection (7):

                    <a name="decision"></a>**_decision_** has the same meaning as in the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Recovery of levy or additional levy

             (1)  An amount of levy, or an amount of additional levy under section 7, is a debt due to the Commonwealth, and payable:

                     (a)  if the Corporation has given written notice to the person who is liable to pay the amount that a person specified in the notice is authorised, in lieu of the Corporation, to receive such an amount—to the specified person in such manner as is prescribed by the regulations or, if there are no such regulations, as that person directs; or

                     (b)  otherwise—to the Corporation in such manner as is prescribed by the regulations or, if there are no such regulations, as the Board directs.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), an amount of levy, or an amount of additional levy under section 7, that is payable but has not been paid may be sued for and recovered by the Corporation or by the other person (if any) to whom the amount is payable, as the case may be, in any court of competent jurisdiction.

             (3)  The Board must give written notice to the Minister before any proceedings are brought to recover an amount under subsection (2).

             (4)  The Minister may give directions as to how amounts paid to, or recovered by, the Corporation or another person under this section are to be dealt with before they are paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
