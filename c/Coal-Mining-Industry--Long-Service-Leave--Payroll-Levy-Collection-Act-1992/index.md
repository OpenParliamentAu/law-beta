                     (c)  a reference to an incentive‑based payment paid to an employee is a reference to a payment of that kind that is paid to the employee at least once a month; and

                     (d)  a reference to a bonus paid to an employee is a reference to a bonus that is paid to the employee at least once a month.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Due date for payment

                   Subject to section 6, levy in respect of eligible wages paid to eligible employees for their employment during a month is payable at the end of the period within which a return is required by this Act to be made in respect of that month.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Returns by employers

             (1)  A person who employs an eligible employee at any time during a month must, within 28 days after the end of that month, make a return in accordance with subsection (2) in respect of that month.

             (2)  A return for the purposes of this section:

                     (a)  must be made:

                              (i)  if the Corporation has given written notice to the person who is required to make the return that a person specified in the notice is authorised, in lieu of the Corporation, to receive returns under this section—to the specified person in such manner as is prescribed by the regulations or, if there are no such regulations, as that person directs; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—to the Corporation in such manner as is prescribed by the regulations or, if there are no such regulations, as the Board directs; and

                     (b)  must be in accordance with a form approved by the Board; and

                     (c)   must contain such information as is required by that form.

             (3)  A person commits an offence of strict liability if the person contravenes subsection (1).

Note:          Part 7A of the Administration Act provides for pecuniary penalties for contraventions of civil penalty provisions.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Extension of time and payment by instalments

             (1)  The Corporation may, in such circumstances as the Corporation thinks fit, extend the time for payment of an amount of levy for such period or periods as the Corporation determines, and, if the Corporation does so, the levy is payable accordingly.

             (2)  The Corporation may, in such circumstances as the Corporation thinks fit, permit the payment of an amount of levy to be made by instalments in such amounts and at such times as the Corporation determines, and, subject to subsection (3), each instalment is payable at the time so determined in relation to that instalment.

             (3)  If the Corporation permits the payment of an amount of levy to be made by instalments and an instalment of an amount of levy is not paid on or before the time for the due payment of the instalment, the whole of the amount outstanding becomes payable at that time.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="levi"></a>**_levy_** includes additional levy under section 7.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Additional levy

             (1)  If any levy remains unpaid on any day after the time when it became payable, or would apart from section 6 have become payable, additional levy is payable by way of penalty by the person liable to pay the levy, at the percentage applicable under subsection (2) in respect of that day, on the amount unpaid, computed from that time or, if under section 6 the Corporation has granted an extension of time for payment of the levy or has permitted payment of the levy to be made by instalments, from such date as the Corporation determines, not being a date before the date on which the levy was originally payable.

             (2)  The percentage applicable in respect of a day is 2 percentage points above the maximum indicator interest rate for that day, where:

                    <a name="maximum-indic-interest-rate"></a>**_maximum indicator interest rate_**, in relation to a day, means the higher or the highest, as the case may be, of the range of rates of interest per annum current on that day quoted by the Reserve Bank, on the basis of reports by each bank regarded by the Reserve Bank as a major trading bank operating in Australia, in respect of overdrafts of $100,000 or more.

                     (a)  an amount of levy; or

                     (b)  an amount that includes an amount of levy;

then:

                     (c)  the levy is not taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to have ceased to be payable merely because of the giving or entering of the judgment; and

                     (d)  if the judgment debt carries interest, the additional levy that would, apart from this paragraph, be payable under this section in relation to the levy is, by force of this paragraph, reduced by:

                              (i)  in a case to which paragraph (a) applies—the amount of the interest; or
