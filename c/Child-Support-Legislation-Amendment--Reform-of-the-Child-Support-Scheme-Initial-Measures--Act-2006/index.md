##### <a id="3"></a>3  Schedule(s)

                   Each Act that is specified in a Schedule to this Act is amended or repealed as set out in the applicable items in the Schedule concerned, and any other item in a Schedule to this Act has effect according to its terms.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Extension of amended Child Support Acts to Western Australia in relation to exnuptial children

             (1)  The Parliament of the Commonwealth intends that a Child Support Act, so far as it is amended by this Act and any other later Act in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children, not extend to Western Australia, unless and until one of the following events occurs:

                     (a)  the Parliament of Western Australia refers to the Parliament of the Commonwealth the matter of the maintenance of exnuptial children or matters that include that matter;

                     (b)  Western Australia adopts the Child Support Act, as so amended.

             (2)  The Parliament of the Commonwealth also intends that, unless and until one of those events occurs, the Child Support Act continue to extend to Western Australia in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children as if those amendments had not been made.

Note:          If a Child Support Act is amended by this Act and any other later Act in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children, unless and until one of the events mentioned in subsection (1) occurs, there are effectively 2 versions of the Child Support Act that apply in Australia. The Child Support Act, as amended, applies:

(a)           in all States and Territories in relation to children of marriages; and

(b)           in all States and Territories, except Western Australia, in relation to exnuptial children.

                   The Child Support Act continues to apply in Western Australia in relation to exnuptial children as if those amendments had not been made.

## 20  Payments and amounts referred to in section 75 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_

(1)       If:

                     (a)  a payment purported to be a payment or repayment of an amount referred to in section 75 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ in relation to the maintenance of an exnuptial child because of the extension of that Act to Western Australia; and

                     (b)  the payment was made:

                              (i)  after a Child Support Act was amended by one or more other Acts in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children; and

                             (ii)  before the earlier of the day on which Western Australia adopted the Child Support Act, as so amended, or the day on which this item commences;

then the payment may, to the extent that it has not already been repaid to the Commonwealth before this item commences, be recovered by the Commonwealth from the person as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

(2)       A person to whom a payment referred to in subitem (1) was made is entitled, on the commencement of this item, to be paid, by the Commonwealth, an amount equal to the amount of the debt due to it by the person under subitem (1).

(4)       The Commonwealth may set‑off the amount of a debt due to it by a person under subitem (1) against an amount that is payable to that person under subitem (2).

(5)       Despite subitems (1) and (2), in applying section 79 of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_ after the commencement of this item, any payment referred to in subitem (1) is to be counted as though it had been validly made under section 76 of that Act.

_Note:       A person will therefore be liable to repay to the Commonwealth the amount of any overpayment of that purported payment to the person._

(6)       This item does not, by implication, affect the recovery or set‑off of other overpayments purporting to be made under the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_.

(7)       To avoid doubt, this item applies to a payment that, because of section 71AA of the _Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988_, is taken to have been paid under section 76 of that Act.

## 21  Validation of past rights and liabilities

(1)       This item applies if, and during the period when, the rights and liabilities of a person under a Child Support Act were different from the rights and liabilities that the person would have had under that Act because:

                     (a)  the Child Support Act was amended, before the commencement of this item, by one or more of the Acts mentioned in subitem 19(3) in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children; and

                     (b)  Western Australia did not adopt the Child Support Act, as so amended.

(2)       During that period, the rights and liabilities of the person are, by force of this item, declared to be, and always to have been, the same as if:

                     (a)  the Child Support Act, as so amended, did not extend to Western Australia; and

                     (b)  the Child Support Act continued to extend to Western Australia in relation to the maintenance of exnuptial children as if those amendments had not been made.
