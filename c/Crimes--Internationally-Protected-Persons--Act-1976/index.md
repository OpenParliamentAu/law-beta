Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article in no way derogate from the obligations of States Parties under international law to take all appropriate measures to prevent other attacks on the person, freedom or dignity of an internationally protected person. <center>_Article 3_</center> 1.	Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the crimes set forth in article 2 in the following cases: <dt>(a)</dt><dd>when the crime is committed in the territory of that State or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>when the alleged offender is a national of that State;</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>when the crime is committed against an internationally protected person as defined in article 1 who enjoys his status as such by virtue of functions which he exercises on behalf of that State.</dd> 2.	Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over these crimes in cases where the alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite him pursuant to article 8 to any of the States mentioned in paragraph 1 of this article. 3.	This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with internal law. <center>_Article 4_</center> States Parties shall co-operate in the prevention of the crimes set forth in article 2, particularly by: <dt>(a)</dt><dd>taking all practicable measures to prevent preparations in their respective territories for the commission of those crimes within or outside their territories;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>exchanging information and co-ordinating the taking of administrative and other measures as appropriate to prevent the commission of those crimes.</dd> <center>_Article 5_</center> 1.	The State Party in which any of the crimes set forth in article 2 has been committed shall, if it has reason to believe that an alleged offender has fled from its territory, communicate to all other States concerned, directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, all the pertinent facts regarding the crime committed and all available information regarding the identity of the alleged offender. 2.	Whenever any of the crimes set forth in article 2 has been committed against an internationally protected person, any State Party which has information concerning the victim and the circumstances of the crime shall endeavour to transmit it, under the conditions provided for in its internal law, fully and promptly to the State Party on whose behalf he was exercising his functions. <center>_Article 6_</center> 1.	Upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, the State Party in whose territory the alleged offender is present shall take the appropriate measures under its internal law so as to ensure his presence for the purpose of prosecution or extradition. Such measures shall be notified without delay directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations to: <dt>(a)</dt><dd>the State where the crime was committed;</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>the State or States of which the alleged offender is a national or, if he is a stateless person, in whose territory he permanently resides;</dd> <dt>(c)</dt><dd>the State or States of which the internationally protected person concerned is a national or on whose behalf he was exercising his functions;</dd> <dt>(d)</dt><dd>all other States concerned; and</dd> <dt>(e)</dt><dd>the international organization of which the internationally protected person concerned is an official or an agent.</dd> 2.	Any person regarding whom the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article are being taken shall be entitled: <dt>(a)</dt><dd>to communicate without delay with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he is a national or which is otherwise entitled to protect his rights or, if he is a stateless person, which he requests and which is willing to protect his rights; and</dd> <dt>(b)</dt><dd>to be visited by a representative of that State.</dd> <center>_Article 7_</center> The State Party in whose territory the alleged offender is present shall, if it does not extradite him, submit, without exception whatsoever and without undue delay, the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with the laws of that State. <center>_Article 8_</center> 1.	To the extent that the crimes set forth in article 2 are not listed as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties, they shall be deemed to be included as such therein. States Parties undertake to include those crimes as extraditable offences in every future extradition treaty to be concluded between them. 2.	If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may, if it decides to extradite, consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition in respect of those crimes. Extradition shall be subject to the procedural provisions and the other conditions of the law of the requested State. 3.	States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize those crimes as extraditable offences between themselves subject to the procedural provisions and the other conditions of the law of the requested State. 4.	Each of the crimes shall be treated, for the purpose of extradition between States Parties, as if it had been committed not only in the place in which it occurred but also in the territories of the States required to establish their jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 1 of article 3\. <center>_Article 9_</center> Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connexion with any of the crimes set forth in article 2 shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings. <center>_Article 10_</center> 1.	States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connexion with criminal proceedings brought in respect of the crimes set forth in article 2, including the supply of all evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings. 2.	The provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not affect obligations concerning mutual judicial assistance embodied in any other treaty. <center>_Article 11_</center> The State Party where an alleged offender is prosecuted shall communicate the final outcome of the proceedings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit the information to the other States Parties. <center>_Article 12_</center> The provisions of this Convention shall not affect the application of the Treaties on Asylum, in force at the date of the adoption of this Convention, as between the States which are parties to those Treaties; but a State Party to this Convention may not invoke those Treaties with respect to another State Party to this Convention which is not a party to those Treaties. <center>_Article 13_</center> 1.	Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention which is not settled by negotiation shall, at the request of one of them, be submitted to arbitration. If within six months from the date of the request for arbitration the parties are unable to agree on the organization of the arbitration, any one of those parties may refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice by request in conformity with the Statute of the Court. 2.	Each State Party may at the time of signature or ratification of this Convention or accession thereto declare that it does not consider itself bound by paragraph 1 of this article. The other States Parties shall not be bound by paragraph 1 of this article with respect to any State Party which has made such a reservation. 3.	Any State Party which has made a reservation in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article may at any time withdraw that reservation by notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. <center>_Article 14_</center> This Convention shall be open for signature by all States, until 31&#160;December 1974 at United Nations Headquarters in New York. <center>_Article 15_</center> This Convention is subject to ratification.
