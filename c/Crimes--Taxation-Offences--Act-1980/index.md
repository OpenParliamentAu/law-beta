             (1)  In proceedings under this Act (including proceedings for the purpose of obtaining an order under section 12), a certificate purporting to be signed by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner and stating that an amount of income tax moneys is or was, or became, due and payable by a company, or by a trustee, on a date specified in the certificate is, subject to subsection (2), conclusive evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a certificate is given by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner under subsection (1) stating that an amount of income tax moneys is or was, or became, due and payable by a company or by a trustee; and

                     (b)  before the certificate was given, it was finally determined, or after the certificate was given it is finally determined, for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act, that the income tax moneys, or part of the income tax moneys, to which the certificate relates did not become payable by the company or trustee;

the certificate is of no effect, or ceases to have effect, as the case requires, in so far as it would, apart from this subsection, be conclusive evidence that the income tax moneys or the part of the income tax moneys, as the case may be, referred to in paragraph (b) were or was, or became, due and payable by the company or trustee on the date specified in the certificate.

             (3)  A reference in subsections (1) and (2), in relation to a company or trustee, to income tax moneys shall be read as a reference to income tax moneys in respect of which a notification (however described) has been given to the company or trustee under the Income Tax Assessment Act.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Stay of proceedings

             (1)  Where, in any proceedings under this Act (including proceedings for the purpose of obtaining an order under section 12), it appears to the court or magistrate that:

                     (a)  the liability of a company or trustee in respect of some income tax moneys has not been finally determined for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

                     (b)  the final determination of the liability of the company or trustee in respect of those income tax moneys is relevant to the determination of the question whether a person is guilty of an offence against this Act;

the court or magistrate shall stay the proceedings under this Act until:

                     (c)  the liability of the company or trustee in respect of those income tax moneys is finally determined; or

                     (d)  it is finally determined that the company or trustee became liable to pay some of those income tax moneys;

whichever first occurs.

             (2)  Nothing in this section limits the power of a court or magistrate under any other law to order a stay of proceedings.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Additional penalty

             (1)  Where a person is convicted of an offence against this Act in relation to a company or trustee, the court may, in addition to imposing a penalty in respect of the offence, order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such amount as the court thinks fit but not exceeding the amount of the income tax moneys due and payable by the company or trustee on the date of the conviction, other than income tax moneys the liability of the company or trustee to pay which is not finally determined for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act.

                     (a)  if the income tax moneys payable by the company or trustee at the time the payment is made exceeds the amount of the payment—the income tax moneys so payable shall be deemed to be reduced, in such manner as the Commissioner determines, by an amount equal to the amount of the payment; or

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 1) 2004 (No. 101, 2004)_

## Schedule 4

## 10  Application

Each amendment made by this Part applies in relation to acts and omissions happening after this Part commences.

## 23  Application

Each amendment made by this Part applies in relation to acts and omissions happening after this Part commences.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 5  Application of Schedule 5 amendments

The repeals and amendments made by Schedule 5 apply to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
