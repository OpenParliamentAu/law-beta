## Part 7.2A—Supervision of financial markets

##### <a id="798F"></a>798F  ASIC to supervise financial markets

                   ASIC has the function of supervising financial markets the operators of which are licensed under subsection 795B(1).

##### <a id="798G"></a>798G  Market integrity rules

             (1)  ASIC may, by legislative instrument, make rules (the **_market integrity rules_**) that deal with the following:

                     (a)  the activities or conduct of licensed markets;

                     (b)  the activities or conduct of persons in relation to licensed markets;

                     (c)  the activities or conduct of persons in relation to financial products traded on licensed markets.

Note:          The market integrity rules will not apply in relation to all licensed markets: see subsection 798H(2).

             (2)  The market integrity rules may include a penalty amount for a rule. A penalty amount must not exceed $1,000,000.

             (3)  ASIC must not make a market integrity rule unless the Minister has consented, in writing, to the making of the rule.

Emergency rules

             (4)  Despite subsection (3), ASIC may make a market integrity rule without the consent of the Minister if ASIC is of the opinion that it is necessary, or in the public interest, to protect people dealing in a financial product or class of financial products.

             (5)  However, if ASIC does so, ASIC must:

                     (a)  provide the Minister, on the following day, with a written explanation of the need for the rule; and

                     (b)  amend or revoke the rule in accordance with any written directions of the Minister.

Minister’s instruments are not legislative instruments

             (6)  None of the following is a legislative instrument:

                     (a)  a consent given under subsection (3);

                     (b)  a direction given under paragraph (5)(b).

##### <a id="798H"></a>798H  Complying with market integrity rules

             (1)  The following entities must comply with the market integrity rules:

                     (a)  operators of licensed markets;

                     (b)  participants in licensed markets;

                     (c)  entities prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

Note:          This subsection is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317E). For relief from liability to a civil penalty relating to this subsection, see section 1317S.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a financial market the operator of which is licensed under subsection 795B(2) (overseas markets).

##### <a id="798J"></a>798J  Directions by ASIC

             (1)  If ASIC is of the opinion that it is necessary, or in the public interest, to protect people dealing in a financial product or class of financial products by:

                     (a)  giving a direction to an entity to suspend dealings in the financial product or class of financial products; or

                     (b)  giving some other direction in relation to those dealings;

ASIC may give written advice to the entity of that opinion and the reasons for it.

Note:          ASIC may also give directions to entities that are market licensees under section 794D. A failure to comply with a direction under that section is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).

             (2)  If, after receiving ASIC’s advice and reasons, the entity does not take:

                     (a)  in the case of a proposed direction to suspend dealings in the financial products—action to prevent such dealings; or

                     (b)  in any other case—such other action as in ASIC’s view is adequate to address the situation raised in the advice;

and ASIC still considers that it is appropriate to give the direction to the entity, ASIC may give the entity the written direction with a statement setting out its reasons for making the direction.

             (3)  The direction has effect for the period specified in it (which may be up to 21 days). During that period, the entity must comply with the direction and must not allow any dealings to take place contrary to it.

             (4)  If the entity fails to comply with the direction, ASIC may apply to the Court for, and the Court may make, an order that the entity comply with the direction.

             (5)  If, at any time after the entity receives ASIC’s advice under subsection (1), the entity requests in writing that ASIC refer the matter to the Minister, ASIC must do so immediately. In that event, the Minister may, if he or she considers it appropriate, require ASIC not to make, or to revoke, the direction. ASIC must immediately comply with such a requirement.

             (6)  ASIC may vary a direction by giving written notice to the entity if ASIC is of the opinion that the variation is necessary, or in the public interest, to protect people dealing in a financial product or class of financial products.

             (7)  ASIC may revoke a direction by giving written notice to the entity.

             (8)  A direction given under subsection (2) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="798K"></a>798K  Alternatives to civil proceedings
