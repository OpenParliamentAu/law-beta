                     (b)  becomes a liability of a specified transferee.

             (2)  The declaration has effect accordingly.

Note:          Total Risk Management Pty. Limited was a subsidiary of CFM when this Act received the Royal Assent.

             (2)  The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the CFM body and the specified transferee as if:

                     (a)  the specified transferee had acquired the asset, liability, right or obligation at the time when, and in the circumstances in which, the CFM body acquired the asset, liability, right or obligation; and

                     (b)  the specified transferee had treated and dealt with the asset, liability, right or obligation in the way that the CFM body treated and dealt with the asset, liability, right or obligation; and
