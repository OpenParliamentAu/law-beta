                             (ii)  necessary or convenient to permit the performance of that function.

          (2A)  The Council must not, under subsection (2):

                     (a)  perform a function conferred on it by a law of a State or Territory; or

                     (b)  exercise a power that is so conferred;

unless the conferral of the function or power is in accordance with the Competition Principles Agreement.

          (2B)  Subsection (2) does not apply to a State/Territory energy law.

Note:          Section 29BA provides that a State/Territory energy law may confer functions or powers, or impose duties, on the Council.

             (3)  In performing its functions, the Council may co‑operate with a department, body or authority of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory.

Note:          Section 29BC sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Council.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a function or power, or the imposition of a duty, by a State/Territory energy law to the extent to which:

                     (a)  the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Council; or

Application

             (1)  This section applies if a State/Territory energy law purports to impose a duty on the Council.

Note:          Section 29BC sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Council.

                     (a)  imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State or Territory concerned; and

                     (b)  imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Council.

Note:          If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having consented under section 29BA to the imposition of the duty by that law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not

             (3)  If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Part to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (4)  If, because of subsection (3), this Part is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Part.

             (5)  The duty is taken to be imposed by this Part in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:

                     (a)  is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Council.

                     (a)  the law confers a function or power on the Council; and

                   The AER consists of:

                     (a)  a Commonwealth AER member, appointed in accordance with section 44AM; and

                     (b)  2 State/Territory AER members, appointed in accordance with section 44AP.

### Division 3—Functions and powers of the AER

##### <a id="44AH"></a>44AH   Commonwealth functions

                   The AER has any functions:

                     (a)  conferred under a law of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  prescribed by regulations made under this Act.

Note:          The AER may have functions under the _Australian Energy Market Act 2004_.

##### <a id="44AI"></a>44AI   Commonwealth consent to conferral of functions etc. on AER

             (1)  A State/Territory energy law may confer functions or powers, or impose duties, on the AER for the purposes of that law.

Note:          Section 44AK sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the AER.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a function or power, or the imposition of a duty, by a State/Territory energy law to the extent to which:

                     (a)  the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the AER; or

                     (b)  the authorisation would otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  The AER cannot perform a duty or function, or exercise a power, under a State/Territory energy law unless the conferral of the function or power, or the imposition of the duty, is in accordance with the Australian Energy Market Agreement, or any other relevant agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or Territory concerned.

##### <a id="44AJ"></a>44AJ  How duty is imposed

Application

             (1)  This section applies if a State/Territory energy law purports to impose a duty on the AER.

Note:          Section 44AK sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the AER.

State or Territory legislative power sufficient to support duty

             (2)  The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Part (or any other law of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:

                     (a)  imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State or Territory concerned; and

                     (b)  imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the AER.

Note:          If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having consented under section 44AI to the imposition of the duty by that law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not

             (3)  If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Part to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (4)  If, because of subsection (3), this Part is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Part.

             (5)  The duty is taken to be imposed by this Part in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:

                     (a)  is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the AER.

             (6)  Subsections (1) to (5) do not limit section 44AI.

##### <a id="44AK"></a>44AK  When a State/Territory energy law imposes a duty

                   For the purposes of sections 44AI and 44AJ, a State/Territory energy law **_imposes a duty_** on the AER if:

                     (a)  the law confers a function or power on the AER; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the function or power is conferred give rise to an obligation on the AER to perform the function or to exercise the power.

##### <a id="44AL"></a>44AL  Powers of the AER

                   The AER has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions.

Note:          State and Territory laws may also confer powers on the AER in respect of its functions under those laws: see section 44AI.

### Division 3—Access to declared services

#### Subdivision A—Scope of Division

##### <a id="44R"></a>44R  Constitutional limits on operation of this Division

                   This Division does not apply in relation to a third party’s access to a service unless:

                     (a)  the provider is a corporation (or a partnership or joint venture consisting wholly of corporations); or

                     (b)  the third party is a corporation; or

                     (c)  the access is (or would be) in the course of, or for the purposes of, constitutional trade or commerce.

#### Subdivision B—Notification of access disputes

##### <a id="44S"></a>44S  Notification of access disputes

             (1)  If a third party is unable to agree with the provider on one or more aspects of access to a declared service, either the provider or the third party may notify the Commission in writing that an access dispute exists, but only to the extent that those aspects of access are not the subject of an access undertaking that is in operation in relation to the service.

Note:          An example of one of the things on which a provider and third party might disagree is whether a previous determination ought to be varied.

             (2)  On receiving the notification, the Commission must give notice in writing of the access dispute to:

                     (a)  the provider, if the third party notified the access dispute;

                     (b)  the third party, if the provider notified the access dispute;

                     (c)  any other person whom the Commission thinks might want to become a party to the arbitration.

##### <a id="44T"></a>44T  Withdrawal of notifications

             (1)  A notification may be withdrawn as follows (and not otherwise):

                     (a)  if the provider notified the dispute:

                              (i)  the provider may withdraw the notification at any time before the Commission makes its final determination;

                             (ii)  the third party may withdraw the provider’s notification at any time after the Commission issues a draft final determination, but before it makes its final determination;

                     (b)  if the third party notified the dispute, the third party may withdraw the notification at any time before the Commission makes its determination.

             (2)  Despite subparagraph (1)(a)(ii), if the provider notified a dispute over variation of a final determination, the third party may not withdraw the provider’s notification.

             (3)  If the notification is withdrawn, it is taken for the purposes of this Part never to have been given.

#### Subdivision C—Arbitration of access disputes

##### <a id="44U"></a>44U  Parties to the arbitration

                   The parties to the arbitration of an access dispute are:

                     (a)  the provider;

                     (b)  the third party;

                     (c)  any other person who applies in writing to be made a party and is accepted by the Commission as having a sufficient interest.

##### <a id="44V"></a>44V  Determination by Commission

             (1)  Unless it terminates the arbitration under section 44Y, 44YA, 44ZZCB or 44ZZCBA, the Commission:

                     (a)  must make a written final determination; and

                     (b)  may make a written interim determination;

on access by the third party to the service.

Note 1:       There are time limits that apply to the Commission’s final determination: see section 44XA.

Note 2:       The Commission may defer arbitration of the access dispute if it is also considering an access undertaking: see section 44ZZCB.

             (2)  A determination may deal with any matter relating to access by the third party to the service, including matters that were not the basis for notification of the dispute. By way of example, the determination may:

                     (a)  require the provider to provide access to the service by the third party;

                     (b)  require the third party to accept, and pay for, access to the service;

                     (c)  specify the terms and conditions of the third party’s access to the service;

                     (d)  require the provider to extend the facility;

                   (da)  require the provider to permit interconnection to the facility by the third party;

                     (e)  specify the extent to which the determination overrides an earlier determination relating to access to the service by the third party.

             (3)  A determination does not have to require the provider to provide access to the service by the third party.

             (4)  Before making a determination, the Commission must give a draft determination to the parties.

             (5)  When the Commission makes a determination, it must give the parties to the arbitration its reasons for making the determination.

             (6)  A determination is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="44W"></a>44W  Restrictions on access determinations

             (1)  The Commission must not make a determination that would have any of the following effects:

                     (a)  preventing an existing user obtaining a sufficient amount of the service to be able to meet the user’s reasonably anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the dispute was notified;

                     (b)  preventing a person from obtaining, by the exercise of a pre‑notification right, a sufficient amount of the service to be able to meet the person’s actual requirements;

                     (c)  depriving any person of a protected contractual right;

                     (d)  resulting in the third party becoming the owner (or one of the owners) of any part of the facility, or of extensions of the facility, without the consent of the provider;

                     (e)  requiring the provider to bear some or all of the costs of extending the facility or maintaining extensions of the facility;

                      (f)  requiring the provider to bear some or all of the costs of interconnections to the facility or maintaining interconnections to the facility.

             (2)  Paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) do not apply in relation to the requirements and rights of the third party and the provider when the Commission is making a determination in arbitration of an access dispute relating to an earlier determination of an access dispute between the third party and the provider.

             (3)  A determination is of no effect if it is made in contravention of subsection (1).

             (4)  If the Commission makes a determination that has the effect of depriving a person (the **_second person_**) of a pre‑notification right to require the provider to supply the service to the second person, the determination must also require the third party:

                     (a)  to pay to the second person such amount (if any) as the Commission considers is fair compensation for the deprivation; and

                     (b)  to reimburse the provider and the Commonwealth for any compensation that the provider or the Commonwealth agrees, or is required by a court order, to pay to the second party as compensation for the deprivation.

Note:          Without infringing paragraph (1)(b), a determination may deprive a second person of the right to be supplied with an amount of service equal to the difference between the total amount of service the person was entitled to under a pre‑notification right and the amount that the person actually needs to meet his or her actual requirements.

          (4A)  If an application for review of a declaration of a service has been made under subsection 44K(1), the Commission must not make a determination in relation to the service until the Tribunal has made its decision on the review.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="existing-user"></a>**_existing user_** means a person (including the provider) who was using the service at the time when the dispute was notified.

                    <a name="pre-notif-right"></a>**_pre‑notification right_** means a right under a contract, or under a determination, that was in force at the time when the dispute was notified.

                    <a name="protect-contractu-right"></a>**_protected contractual right_** means a right under a contract that was in force at the beginning of 30 March 1995.

             (4)  The Commission may reject the undertaking if it:

                     (a)  includes a term that is not a fixed principle and that the Commission considers should be a fixed principle; or

                     (b)  includes a fixed principle that the Commission considers should not be fixed; or

                     (c)  includes a fixed principle that the Commission considers should be fixed for a period that is different from the period specified in the undertaking.

However, the Commission must not reject the undertaking solely on the basis that it is consistent with a fixed principle that is included in the undertaking in compliance with subsection (6).

Fixed principles must be carried over to later undertakings

             (5)  Subsection (6) applies if:

                     (a)  the Commission accepts an undertaking (the **_earlier undertaking_**) in connection with the provision of access to a service that includes a fixed principle; and

                     (b)  an undertaking (the **_later undertaking_**) is given to the Commission in connection with the provision of access to the service within the fixed period for the fixed principle; and

                     (c)  at the time the later undertaking is given:

                              (i)  the fixed principle has not been revoked under subsection (7); and

                             (ii)  the earlier undertaking has not been varied under subsection 44ZZA(7) so that the fixed principle is no longer a term of the earlier undertaking.

             (6)  The Commission must not accept the later undertaking under section 44ZZA unless the undertaking includes a term that is the same as the fixed principle.

Variation or revocation of fixed principles when no undertaking is in operation

             (7)  If there is no access undertaking in operation in connection with the provision of access to a service, the provider may revoke or vary a fixed principle that relates to the service (including the fixed period for the principle), but only with the consent of the Commission. The Commission may consent to the revocation or variation of the fixed principle if it thinks it appropriate to do so having regard to the matters in subsection 44ZZA(3).

Note:          Subsection 44ZZA(7) contains provision for fixed principles to be varied or revoked in the situation where there is an access undertaking in operation. This may include a variation of the fixed period for the fixed principle.

Alteration of fixed principles

             (8)  If an undertaking that is accepted by the Commission contains one or more fixed principles, the undertaking is accepted on the basis that:

                     (a)  the principle may be varied or revoked under subsection (7) or 44ZZA(7); and

                     (b)  the principle may be cancelled, revoked, terminated or varied by or under later legislation; and

                     (c)  no compensation is payable if the principle is cancelled, revoked, terminated or varied as mentioned in any of the above paragraphs.

             (9)  Subsection (8) does not, by implication, affect the interpretation of any other provision of this Act.

##### <a id="44ZZAA"></a>44ZZAA  Access codes prepared by industry bodies

             (1)  An industry body may give a written code to the Commission setting out rules for access to a service.

                     (c)  the interests of persons who might want access to the service covered by the code;

                     (e)  any matters specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection;

                      (f)  any other matters that the Commission thinks are relevant.

             (6)  The industry body may:

                     (a)  withdraw the code given under subsection (1) at any time before the Commission makes a decision whether to accept the code; and

                     (b)  withdraw or vary the code at any time after it has been accepted by the Commission, but only with the consent of the Commission.

The Commission may consent to a variation of the code if it thinks it appropriate to do so having regard to the matters in subsection (3).

Note:          The Commission may rely on industry body consultations before giving its consent: see section 44ZZAB.

             (7)  If the industry body that gave the code to the Commission has ceased to exist, a withdrawal or variation under subsection (6) may be made by a body or association prescribed by the regulations as a replacement for the original industry body.

             (8)  In this section:

                    <a name="code"></a>**_code_** means a set of rules (which may be in general terms or detailed terms).

                     (a)  the Commission defers arbitrating the access dispute; and

                     (b)  the Commission then accepts the access undertaking and it comes into operation;

then the Commission must terminate the arbitration when the undertaking comes into operation, but only to the extent of the matters relating to access to the service that are dealt with in the undertaking.

Note:          The third party’s access to the service is determined under the access undertaking to the extent of the matters it deals with.

Deferral of consideration of access undertaking

             (3)  If:

             (5)  In exercising the power conferred by subsection (1), the Commission must have regard to:

                     (a)  the fact that the access undertaking will, if accepted, apply generally to access seekers and a final determination relating to the access dispute will only apply to the parties to the arbitration; and

                     (b)  any guidelines in force under subsection (6).

It may have regard to any other matter it considers relevant.

             (6)  The Commission must, by legislative instrument, determine guidelines for the purposes of subsection (5).

             (7)  The Commission must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the first set of guidelines under subsection (6) is made within 6 months after the commencement of this subsection.

Resumption of arbitration if declaration affirmed

             (3)  If the Commission defers arbitrating the access dispute and the Tribunal affirms the declaration, the Commission must resume arbitrating the dispute.

Termination of arbitration if declaration varied or set aside

             (4)  If the Commission defers arbitrating the access dispute and the Tribunal sets aside or varies the declaration, the Commission must terminate the arbitration.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  an arbitration is terminated under subsection (4) or section 44YA; and

             (3)  A reference in this section to a person involved in the contravention is a reference to a person who has:

                     (a)  aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention; or

             (1)  If the Federal Court is satisfied, on the application of any person, that another person (the **_obstructor_**) has engaged, is engaging, or is proposing to engage in conduct constituting a contravention of section 44ZZ, the Court may make all or any of the following orders:

                     (a)  an order granting an injunction on such terms as the Court thinks appropriate:

                              (i)  restraining the obstructor from engaging in the conduct; or

                     (c)  the date on which the determination was made.

##### <a id="44ZZM"></a>44ZZM   Commonwealth consent to conferral of functions etc. on the Commission or Tribunal by State or Territory laws

             (1)  A State or Territory access regime law may confer functions or powers, or impose duties, on the Commission or Tribunal.

Note:          Section 44ZZMB sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Commission or Tribunal.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a function or power, or the imposition of a duty, by a law of a State or Territory to the extent to which:

                     (a)  the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal; or

                     (b)  the authorisation would otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  The Commission or Tribunal cannot perform a duty or function, or exercise a power, under a State or Territory access regime law unless the conferral of the function or power, or the imposition of the duty, is in accordance with an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State or Territory concerned.

##### <a id="44ZZMA"></a>44ZZMA  How duty is imposed

Application

             (1)  This section applies if a State or Territory access regime law purports to impose a duty on the Commission or Tribunal.

Note:          Section 44ZZMB sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the Commission or Tribunal.

State or Territory legislative power sufficient to support duty

             (2)  The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Act (or any other law of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:

                     (a)  imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State or Territory concerned; and

                     (b)  imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal.

Note:          If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having consented under section 44ZZM to the imposition of the duty by that law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not

             (3)  If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (4)  If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Act.

             (5)  The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:

                     (a)  is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal.

             (6)  Subsections (1) to (5) do not limit section 44ZZM.

##### <a id="44ZZMB"></a>44ZZMB  When a law of a State or Territory imposes a duty

                   For the purposes of sections 44ZZM and 44ZZMA, a State or Territory access regime law **_imposes a duty_** on the Commission or Tribunal if:

                     (a)  the law confers a function or power on the Commission or Tribunal; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the function or power is conferred give rise to an obligation on the Commission or Tribunal to perform the function or to exercise the power.

##### <a id="44ZZN"></a>44ZZN  Compensation for acquisition of property

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a determination would result in an acquisition of property; and

                     (b)  the determination would not be valid, apart from this section, because a particular person has not been sufficiently compensated;

the Commonwealth must pay that person:

                     (c)  a reasonable amount of compensation agreed on between the person and the Commonwealth; or

                     (d)  failing agreement—a reasonable amount of compensation determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (2)  In assessing compensation payable in a proceeding begun under this section, the following must be taken into account if they arise out of the same event or transaction:

                     (a)  any damages or compensation recovered, or other remedy, in a proceeding begun otherwise than under this section;

                     (b)  compensation awarded under a determination.

             (3)  In this section, **_acquisition of property_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

is taken for the purposes of this Part to have been engaged in also by the body corporate, unless the body corporate establishes that the body corporate took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct.

             (3)  If, in a proceeding under this Part in respect of conduct engaged in by an individual, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of the individual, it is sufficient to show:

                     (b)  that the servant or agent had the relevant state of mind.

is taken, for the purposes of this Part, to have been engaged in also by that individual, unless that individual establishes that he or she took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  an individual is convicted of an offence; and

                     (b)  the individual would not have been convicted of the offence if subsections (3) and (4) had not been enacted;

                     (a)  the knowledge, intention, opinion, belief or purpose of the person; and

                     (b)  the person’s reasons for the intention, opinion, belief or purpose.

                             (ii)  by reason of subsection 93(7) conduct engaged in by that person on that condition is not to be taken to have the effect of substantially lessening competition within the meaning of section 47; or

                            (iii)  a notice under subsection 93(1) is in force in relation to conduct engaged in by that person on that condition.

          (6A)  The following conduct:

                     (a)  the making of a dual listed company arrangement;

                     (b)  the giving effect to a provision of a dual listed company arrangement;

does not contravene this section if the conduct would, or would apart from subsection 88(8B), contravene section 49.

             (7)  This section does not apply to or in relation to a contract, arrangement or understanding in so far as the contract, arrangement or understanding provides, or to or in relation to a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding in so far as the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding would provide, directly or indirectly for the acquisition of any shares in the capital of a body corporate or any assets of a person.

                     (b)  the notice is in force under section 93AD.

             (9)  The making by a corporation of a contract that contains a provision in relation to which subsection 88(1) applies is not a contravention of subsection (2) of this section if:

                     (a)  the contract is subject to a condition that the provision will not come into force unless and until the corporation is granted an authorization to give effect to the provision; and

                     (b)  the corporation applies for the grant of such an authorization within 14 days after the contract is made;

but nothing in this subsection prevents the giving effect by a corporation to such a provision from constituting a contravention of subsection (2).

##### <a id="45B"></a>45B  Covenants affecting competition

             (1)  A covenant, whether the covenant was given before or after the commencement of this section, is unenforceable in so far as it confers rights or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation or on a person associated with a corporation if the covenant has, or is likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition in any market in which the corporation or any person associated with the corporation supplies or acquires, or is likely to supply or acquire, goods or services or would, but for the covenant, supply or acquire, or be likely to supply or acquire, goods or services.

             (2)  A corporation or a person associated with a corporation shall not:

                     (a)  require the giving of a covenant, or give a covenant, if the proposed covenant has the purpose, or would have or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in any market in which:

                              (i)  the corporation, or any person associated with the corporation by virtue of paragraph (7)(b), supplies or acquires, is likely to supply or acquire, or would, but for the covenant, supply or acquire, or be likely to supply or acquire, goods or services; or

                     (b)  threaten to engage in particular conduct if a person who, but for subsection (1), would be bound by a covenant does not comply with the terms of the covenant; or

                     (c)  engage in particular conduct by reason that a person who, but for subsection (1), would be bound by a covenant has failed to comply, or proposes or threatens to fail to comply, with the terms of the covenant.

             (3)  Where a person:

                     (a)  issues an invitation to another person to enter into a contract containing a covenant;

                     (b)  makes an offer to another person to enter into a contract containing a covenant; or

                     (c)  makes it known that the person will not enter into a contract of a particular kind unless the contract contains a covenant of a particular kind or in particular terms;

the first‑mentioned person shall, by issuing that invitation, making that offer or making that fact known, be deemed to require the giving of the covenant.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, a covenant or proposed covenant shall be deemed to have, or to be likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market if the covenant or proposed covenant, as the case may be, would have, or be likely to have, that effect when taken together with the effect or likely effect on competition in that market of any other covenant or proposed covenant to the benefit of which:

                     (a)  a corporation that, or person who, is or would be, or but for subsection (1) would be, entitled to the benefit of the first‑mentioned covenant or proposed covenant; or

is or would be, or but for subsection (1) would be, entitled.

             (5)  The requiring of the giving of, or the giving of, a covenant does not constitute a contravention of this section by reason that giving effect to the covenant would, or would but for the operation of subsection 88(8) or section 93, constitute a contravention of section 47 and this section does not apply to or in relation to engaging in conduct in relation to a covenant by way of:

                     (a)  conduct that contravenes, or would but for the operation of subsection 88(8) or section 93 contravene, section 47; or

                     (b)  doing an act by reason of a breach or threatened breach of a condition referred to in subsection 47(2), (4), (6) or (8), being an act done by a person at a time when:

                              (i)  an authorization under subsection 88(8) is in force in relation to conduct engaged in by that person on that condition; or

                             (ii)  by reason of subsection 93(7) conduct engaged in by that person on that condition is not to be taken to have the effect of substantially lessening competition within the meaning of section 47; or

                            (iii)  a notice under subsection 93(1) is in force in relation to conduct engaged in by that person on that condition.

             (6)  This section does not apply to or in relation to a covenant or proposed covenant where the only persons who are or would be respectively bound by, or entitled to the benefit of, the covenant or proposed covenant are persons who are associated with each other or are bodies corporate that are related to each other.

             (7)  For the purposes of this section, section 45C and subparagraph 87(3)(a)(ii), a person and a corporation shall be taken to be associated with each other in relation to a covenant or proposed covenant if, and only if:

                     (a)  the person is under an obligation (otherwise than in pursuance of the covenant or proposed covenant), whether formal or informal, to act in accordance with directions, instructions or wishes of the corporation in relation to the covenant or proposed covenant; or

                     (b)  the person is a body corporate in relation to which the corporation is in the position mentioned in subparagraph 4A(1)(a)(ii).

             (8)  The requiring by a person of the giving of, or the giving by a person of, a covenant in relation to which subsection 88(5) applies is not a contravention of subsection (2) of this section if:

                     (a)  the covenant is subject to a condition that the covenant will not come into force unless and until the person is granted an authorization to require the giving of, or to give, the covenant; and

                     (b)  the person applies for the grant of such an authorization within 14 days after the covenant is given;

but nothing in this subsection affects the application of paragraph (2)(b) or (c) in relation to the covenant.

             (9)  This section does not apply to or in relation to a covenant or proposed covenant if:

                     (a)  the sole or principal purpose for which the covenant was or is required to be given was or is to prevent the relevant land from being used otherwise than for residential purposes;

                     (b)  the person who required or requires the covenant to be given was or is a religious, charitable or public benevolent institution or a trustee for such an institution and the covenant was or is required to be given for or in accordance with the purposes or objects of that institution; or

##### <a id="45DD"></a>45DD  Situations in which boycotts permitted

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to employment 
 matters—conduct by a person

             (1)  A person does not contravene, and is not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) by engaging in conduct if the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of that person or of another person employed by an employer of that person.

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to employment 
 matters—conduct by employee organisation and employees

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an employee, or 2 or more employees who are employed by the same employer, engage in conduct in concert with another person who is, or with other persons each of whom is:

                              (i)  an organisation of employees; or

                             (ii)  an officer of an organisation of employees; and

                     (b)  the conduct is only engaged in by the persons covered by paragraph (a); and

                     (c)  the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of the employee, or any of the employees, covered by paragraph (a); 

the persons covered by paragraph (a) do not contravene, and are not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) by engaging in the conduct.

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to environmental protection or consumer protection

             (3)  A person does not contravene, and is not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) by engaging in conduct if:

                     (a)  the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to environmental protection or consumer protection; and

                     (b)  engaging in the conduct is not industrial action.

Note 1:       If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is a body corporate:

(a)    it is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption; and

(b)    each of its members is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption.

Note 2:       If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is not a body corporate:

(a)    it is not a “person” and is therefore not subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) (consequently, this exemption does not cover the organisation as such); but

(b)    each of its members is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption.

Meaning of**industrial action**—basic definition

             (4)  In subsection (3), **_industrial action_** means:

                     (a)  the performance of work in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a practice in relation to work, the result of which is a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work, where:

                              (i)  the terms and conditions of the work are prescribed, wholly or partly, by a workplace instrument or an order of an industrial body; or

                             (ii)  the work is performed, or the practice is adopted, in connection with an industrial dispute; or

                     (b)  a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed by a workplace instrument or by an order of an industrial body; or

                     (c)  a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, that is adopted in connection with an industrial dispute; or

                     (d)  a failure or refusal by persons to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by persons who attend for work.

For this purpose, **_industrial body_** and **_workplace instrument_** have the same meanings as in the _Fair Work Act 2009_.

Meaning of **industrial action**—further clarification

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (3):

                     (a)  conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that persons are required to perform in the course of their employment; and

                     (b)  a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions.

Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not protect people not covered by them

             (6)  In applying subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) to a person who is not covered by subsection (1), (2) or (3) in respect of certain conduct, disregard the fact that other persons may be covered by one of those subsections in respect of the same conduct. 

Defences to contravention of subsection 45DB(1)

             (7)  In a proceeding under this Act in relation to a contravention of subsection 45DB(1), it is a defence if the defendant proves:

                     (a)  that a notice in respect of the conduct concerned has been duly given to the Commission under subsection 93(1) and the Commission has not given a notice in respect of the conduct under subsection 93(3) or (3A); or

                     (b)  that the dominant purpose for which the defendant engaged in the conduct concerned was to preserve or further a business carried on by him or her.

Each person to prove defence

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  a person engages in conduct in concert with another person; and

                     (b)  the other person proves a matter specified in paragraph (7)(a) or (b) in respect of that conduct;

in applying subsection 45DB(1) to the first person, ignore the fact that the other person has proved that matter.

Note:          Section 415 of the _Fair Work Act 2009_ limits the right to bring actions under this Act  in respect of industrial action that is protected action for the purposes of that section.

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Misuse of market power

             (1)  A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power in that or any other market for the purpose of:

                     (a)  eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation or of a body corporate that is related to the corporation in that or any other market;

                     (b)  preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or

                     (c)  deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market.

    (1AAA)  If a corporation supplies goods or services for a sustained period at a price that is less than the relevant cost to the corporation of supplying the goods or services, the corporation may contravene subsection (1) even if the corporation cannot, and might not ever be able to, recoup losses incurred by supplying the goods or services.

       (1AA)  A corporation that has a substantial share of a market must not supply, or offer to supply, goods or services for a sustained period at a price that is less than the relevant cost to the corporation of supplying such goods or services, for the purpose of:

                     (a)  eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation or of a body corporate that is related to the corporation in that or any other market; or

                     (b)  preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or

                     (c)  deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market.

       (1AB)  For the purposes of subsection (1AA), without limiting the matters to which the Court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a corporation has a substantial share of a market, the Court may have regard to the number and size of the competitors of the corporation in the market.

          (1A)  For the purposes of subsections (1) and (1AA):

                     (a)  the reference in paragraphs (1)(a) and (1AA)(a) to a competitor includes a reference to competitors generally, or to a particular class or classes of competitors; and

                     (b)  the reference in paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) and (1AA)(b) and (c) to a person includes a reference to persons generally, or to a particular class or classes of persons.

                     (a)  a body corporate that is related to a corporation has, or 2 or more bodies corporate each of which is related to the one corporation together have, a substantial degree of power in a market; or

                     (b)  a corporation and a body corporate that is, or a corporation and 2 or more bodies corporate each of which is, related to that corporation, together have a substantial degree of power in a market;

the corporation shall be taken for the purposes of this section to have a substantial degree of power in that market.

             (3)  In determining for the purposes of this section the degree of power that a body corporate or bodies corporate has or have in a market, the court shall have regard to the extent to which the conduct of the body corporate or of any of those bodies corporate in that market is constrained by the conduct of:

                     (a)  competitors, or potential competitors, of the body corporate or of any of those bodies corporate in that market; or

                     (b)  persons to whom or from whom the body corporate or any of those bodies corporate supplies or acquires goods or services in that market.

          (3A)  In determining for the purposes of this section the degree of power that a body corporate or bodies corporate has or have in a market, the court may have regard to the power the body corporate or bodies corporate has or have in that market that results from:

                     (a)  any contracts, arrangements or understandings, or proposed contracts, arrangements or understandings, that the body corporate or bodies corporate has or have, or may have, with another party or other parties; and

                     (b)  any covenants, or proposed covenants, that the body corporate or bodies corporate is or are, or would be, bound by or entitled to the benefit of.

          (3B)  Subsections (3) and (3A) do not, by implication, limit the matters to which regard may be had in determining, for the purposes of this section, the degree of power that a body corporate or bodies corporate has or have in a market.

          (3C)  For the purposes of this section, without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a body corporate has a substantial degree of power in a market, a body corporate may have a substantial degree of power in a market even though:

                     (a)  the body corporate does not substantially control the market; or

                     (b)  the body corporate does not have absolute freedom from constraint by the conduct of:

                              (i)  competitors, or potential competitors, of the body corporate in that market; or

                             (ii)  persons to whom or from whom the body corporate supplies or acquires goods or services in that market.

          (3D)  To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this section, more than 1 corporation may have a substantial degree of power in a market.

                     (a)  a reference to power is a reference to market power;

                     (b)  a reference to a market is a reference to a market for goods or services; and

          (4A)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a corporation has contravened subsection (1), the court may have regard to:

                     (a)  any conduct of the corporation that consisted of supplying goods or services for a sustained period at a price that was less than the relevant cost to the corporation of supplying such goods or services; and

                     (b)  the reasons for that conduct.

             (5)  Without extending by implication the meaning of subsection (1), a corporation shall not be taken to contravene that subsection by reason only that it acquires plant or equipment.

             (6)  This section does not prevent a corporation from engaging in conduct that does not constitute a contravention of any of the following sections, namely, sections 45, 45B, 47, 49 and 50, by reason that an authorization or clearance is in force or by reason of the operation of subsection 45(8A) or section 93.

          (6A)  In determining for the purposes of this section whether, by engaging in conduct, a corporation has taken advantage of its substantial degree of power in a market, the court may have regard to any or all of the following:

                     (a)  whether the conduct was materially facilitated by the corporation’s substantial degree of power in the market;

                     (b)  whether the corporation engaged in the conduct in reliance on its substantial degree of power in the market;

                     (c)  whether it is likely that the corporation would have engaged in the conduct if it did not have a substantial degree of power in the market;

                     (d)  whether the conduct is otherwise related to the corporation’s substantial degree of power in the market.

This subsection does not limit the matters to which the court may have regard.

             (7)  Without in any way limiting the manner in which the purpose of a person may be established for the purposes of any other provision of this Act, a corporation may be taken to have taken advantage of its power for a purpose referred to in subsection (1) notwithstanding that, after all the evidence has been considered, the existence of that purpose is ascertainable only by inference from the conduct of the corporation or of any other person or from other relevant circumstances.

             (4)  In determining for the purposes of this section the degree of market power that a body corporate or bodies corporate has or have in a trans‑Tasman market, the Federal Court is to have regard to the extent to which the conduct of the body corporate or of any of those bodies corporate, in the trans‑Tasman market is constrained by the conduct of:

                     (b)  persons to whom or from whom the body corporate, or any of those bodies corporate, supplies or acquires goods or services in the trans‑Tasman market.

             (5)  Without extending by implication the meaning of subsection (2), a corporation is not taken to contravene that subsection merely because it acquires plant or equipment.

             (6)  This section does not prevent a corporation from engaging in conduct that does not constitute a contravention of any of the following sections, namely, sections 45, 45B, 47, 49 and 50, because an authorisation or clearance is in force or because of the operation of subsection 45(8A) or section 93.

             (7)  Without limiting the manner in which the purpose of a person may be established for the purposes of any other provision of this Act, a corporation may be taken to have taken advantage of its market power for a purpose referred to in subsection (2) even though, after all the evidence has been considered, the existence of that purpose is ascertainable only by inference from the conduct of the corporation or of any other person or from other relevant circumstances.

             (8)  It is the intention of the Parliament that this section, and the provisions of Parts VI and XII so far as they relate to a contravention of this section, should apply to New Zealand and New Zealand Crown corporations to the same extent, and in the same way, as they respectively apply under section 2A to the Commonwealth and authorities of the Commonwealth.

             (3)  If conduct constitutes a contravention of two or more provisions of Part IV (other than section 44ZZRF or 44ZZRG), a proceeding may be instituted under this Act against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of the provisions but a person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this section in respect of the same conduct.

             (4)  The single pecuniary penalty that may be imposed in accordance with subsection (3) in respect of conduct that contravenes provisions to which 2 or more of the limits in paragraphs (1A)(aa), (a) and (b) apply is an amount up to the highest of those limits.

Annual turnover

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, the **_annual turnover_** of a body corporate, during the turnover period, is the sum of the values of all the supplies that the body corporate, and any body corporate related to the body corporate, have made, or are likely to make, during that period, other than:

             (2)  In proceedings against a person (the **_respondent_**) under section 76 in relation to an alleged contravention of section 95AZN, it is a defence if the respondent establishes:

at the time when the alleged contravention occurred.

##### <a id="76B"></a>76B  What happens if substantially the same conduct is a contravention of Part IV or section 95AZN and an offence?

             (2)  The Court must not make a pecuniary penalty order against a person in relation to a contravention of Part IV or section 95AZN if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

             (3)  Proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order against a person in relation to a contravention of Part IV or section 95AZN are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

The proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings are dismissed.

             (4)  Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of Part IV or section 95AZN regardless of whether a pecuniary penalty order has been made against the person in respect of the contravention.

             (5)  Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order against the individual for a contravention of Part IV or section 95AZN (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.

                    <a name="offenc"></a>**_offence_** means an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

a Court may:

                     (c)  exercise any power that the Court has apart from this section with respect to the enforcement and recovery of fines imposed by the Court; or

                     (d)  make an order, on the application of the Minister or the Commission, declaring that the fine is to have effect, and may be enforced, as if it were a judgment debt under a judgment of the Court.

             (2)  Where a person in relation to whom an order is made under subsection (1) in respect of a fine gives security for the payment of the fine, the Court shall cancel the order in respect of the fine.

             (3)  Where the Court makes an order in relation to a person in respect of a fine, the Court may, at any time before the order is executed in respect of the fine, allow the person a specified time in which to pay the fine or allow the person to pay the fine by specified instalments, and, in that case:

                     (a)  the order shall not be executed unless the person fails to pay the fine within that time or fails to pay an instalment at or before the time when it becomes payable, as the case may be; and

                     (b)  if the person pays the fine within that time or pays all the instalments, as the case may be, the order shall be deemed to have been discharged in respect of the fine.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (7), an order under subsection (1) in respect of a fine ceases to have effect:

                     (a)  on payment of the fine; or

                     (b)  if the fine is not paid—on full compliance with the order.

             (5)  The term of a sentence of imprisonment imposed by an order under a law of a State or Territory applied by section 15A of the _Crimes Act 1914_ (including an order described in subsection 15A(1AA) of that Act) in respect of a fine shall be calculated at the rate of one day’s imprisonment for each $25 of the amount of the fine that is from time to time unpaid.

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), where a person is required to serve periods of imprisonment by virtue of an order or orders under subsection (1) in respect of 2 or more fines, those periods of imprisonment shall be served consecutively.

             (7)  Subject to subsection (8), where:

                     (a)  a person would, but for this subsection, be required by virtue of an order or orders under subsection (1) in respect of 3 or more fines to serve periods of imprisonment in respect of those fines exceeding in the aggregate 3 years; and

                     (b)  those fines were imposed (whether or not in the same proceedings) for offences constituted by contraventions that occurred within a period of 2 years, being contraventions that appear to the Court to have been of the same nature or a substantially similar nature;

the Court shall, by order, declare that the order or orders shall cease to have effect in respect of those fines after the person has served an aggregate of 3 years’ imprisonment in respect of those fines.

             (8)  Where subsection (7) would, but for this subsection, apply to a person with respect to offences committed by the person within 2 or more overlapping periods of 2 years, the Court shall make an order under that subsection with respect to one only of those periods, being whichever period would give the person the maximum benefit from the application of that subsection.

             (9)  For the purposes of subsection (8), the Court may vary or revoke an order made under subsection (7).

           (11)  This section applies only in relation to fines imposed for offences committed after the commencement of this section.

                     (a)  it is appropriate to order a person (the **_defendant_**):

                              (i)  to pay a pecuniary penalty under section 76; or

                             (ii)  to impose a fine under section 44ZZRF or 44ZZRG;

                            in respect of a contravention, or an involvement in a contravention, of this Act; and

                     (b)  it is appropriate to order the defendant to pay compensation to a person who has suffered loss or damage in respect of the contravention or the involvement; and

                     (c)  the defendant does not have sufficient financial resources to pay both the pecuniary penalty or fine and the compensation;

the Court must give preference to making an order for compensation.

##### <a id="80"></a>80  Injunctions

             (1)  Subject to subsections (1A), (1AAA) and (1B), where, on the application of the Commission or any other person, the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct that constitutes or would constitute:

                     (a)  a contravention of a provision of:

                              (i)  Part IV; or

                             (ii)  Division 2 or 5 of Part IVB; or

                     (b)  attempting to contravene such a provision; or

                      (f)  conspiring with others to contravene such a provision;

the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.

Note:          Section 87AA provides that, if boycott conduct is involved in proceedings, the Court must have regard to certain matters in exercising its powers under this Part. (**_Boycott conduct_** is defined in subsection 87AA(2).)

       (1AA)  Where an application for an injunction under subsection (1) has been made, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection, the Court may, if the Court determines it to be appropriate, grant an injunction by consent of all the parties to the proceedings, whether or not the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct of a kind mentioned in subsection (1).

          (1A)  A person other than the Commission is not entitled to make an application under subsection (1) for an injunction by reason that a person has contravened or attempted to contravene or is proposing to contravene, or has been or is proposing to be involved in a contravention of, section 50.

    (1AAA)  Subject to subsection (1B), a person other than the Minister or the Commission may not apply for an injunction on the ground of:

             (2)  Where in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, the Court may grant an interim injunction pending determination of an application under subsection (1).

             (3)  The Court may rescind or vary an injunction granted under subsection (1) or (2).

             (4)  The power of the Court to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised:

                     (a)  whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind;

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and

                     (c)  whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first‑mentioned person engages in conduct of that kind.

             (5)  The power of the Court to grant an injunction requiring a person to do an act or thing may be exercised:

                     (a)  whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do that act or thing;

                     (b)  whether or not the person has previously refused or failed to do that act or thing; and

                     (c)  whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first‑mentioned person refuses or fails to do that act or thing.

             (6)  Where the Minister or the Commission makes an application to the Court for the grant of an injunction under this section, the Court shall not require the applicant or any other person, as a condition of granting an interim injunction, to give any undertakings as to damages.

          (6A)  Subsection (6) does not apply to an application by the Minister for an injunction relating to Part IV.

             (7)  Where:

                     (a)  in a case to which subsection (6) does not apply the Court would, but for this subsection, require a person to give an undertaking as to damages or costs; and

                     (b)  the Minister gives the undertaking;

the Court shall accept the undertaking by the Minister and shall not require a further undertaking from any other person.

             (8)  Subsection (7) does not apply in relation to an application for an injunction relating to Part IV.

             (9)  If the Director of Public Prosecutions makes an application to the Court for the grant of an injunction under this section in relation to:

                     (a)  a person’s contravention, or proposed contravention, of section 44ZZRF or 44ZZRG; or

                     (b)  a person’s involvement, or proposed involvement, in a contravention of section 44ZZRF or 44ZZRG;

the Court must not require the Director of Public Prosecutions or any other person, as a condition of granting an interim injunction, to give any undertakings as to damages.

##### <a id="80AB"></a>80AB  Stay of injunctions

             (1)  The Court may stay the operation of an injunction granted under section 80 if:

                     (a)  the injunction is in respect of conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1), 45DB(1), 45E(2) or 45E(3) or section 45EA or an associated contravention; and

                     (b)  there is a proceeding in respect of a dispute relating to the conduct pending before a court, tribunal or authority of a State or Territory under a prescribed provision of a law of the State or Territory; and

                     (c)  the conduct relates to the supply of goods or services to, or the acquisition of goods or services from, a person who is or becomes a party to the proceeding referred to in paragraph (b); and

                     (d)  any of the following has applied for the stay:

                              (i)  a Minister of the Commonwealth;

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (b)(ii) applies—a Minister of the State or Territory concerned;

                            (iii)  a party to the proceeding for the injunction; and

                     (e)  the Court considers that granting the stay:

                              (i)  would be likely to facilitate the settlement of the dispute by conciliation; and

                             (ii)  would, in all the circumstances, be just.

             (2)  An order staying the operation of the injunction may be expressed to have effect for a specified period and may be varied or rescinded by the Court at any time.

             (3)  If the proceeding referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is terminated because the State or Territory court, tribunal or authority has settled the dispute to which the conduct relates by conciliation, the Court must not make any order in relation to the costs of the proceedings in respect of the granting of the injunction or in relation to the costs of any proceedings for the rescission of the injunction.

             (4)  Nothing in this section affects other powers of the Court.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="associated-contravent"></a>**_associated contravention_** means:

                     (a)  attempting to contravene subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1), 45DB(1), 45E(2) or 45E(3) or section 45EA; or

                     (b)  aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a person to contravene any of those provisions; or

                     (c)  inducing, or attempting to induce, a person (whether by threats, promises or otherwise) to contravene any of those provisions; or

                     (d)  being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of any of those provisions; or

                     (e)  conspiring with others to contravene any of those provisions.

                    <a name="injunct"></a>**_injunction_** includes an interim injunction.

##### <a id="80AC"></a>80AC  Injunctions to prevent mergers if clearance or authorisation granted on the basis of false or misleading information

             (1)  If, on the application of the Commission, the Court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a person is proposing to acquire shares in the capital of a body corporate or assets of a person; and

                     (b)  the person was granted, under Division 3 of Part VII (mergers), a clearance or an authorisation for the proposed acquisition on the basis of information that was false or misleading in a material particular; and

                     (c)  that information was given by the person or a body corporate that was related to the person; and

                     (d)  if that information had not been given, the clearance or authorisation would not have been granted; and

                     (e)  apart from the clearance or authorisation, the acquisition would contravene section 50 if it occurred;

then the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.

             (2)  However, the Court must not grant the injunction if:

                     (a)  the person was granted both a clearance and an authorisation for the acquisition under Division 3 of Part VII; and

                     (b)  the Court could not grant an injunction under this section in relation to both the clearance and the authorisation.

Example:    If a clearance for an acquisition was granted by the Commission on the basis of false or misleading information, and an authorisation for the acquisition was granted by the Tribunal on the basis of true information, then the Court cannot grant an injunction under this section because it would not be able to grant the injunction in relation to the authorisation.

##### <a id="81"></a>81  Divestiture where merger contravenes section 50 or 50A

             (1)  The Court may, on the application of the Commission or any other person, if it finds, or has in another proceeding instituted under this Part found, that a person has contravened section 50, by order, give directions for the purpose of securing the disposal by the person of all or any of the shares or assets acquired in contravention of that section.

          (1A)  Where:

                     (a)  the Court finds, in a proceeding instituted under this Part, that a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_acquirer_**) has acquired shares in the capital of a body corporate or any assets of a person in contravention of section 50;

                     (b)  the Court finds, whether in that proceeding or any other proceeding instituted under this Part, that the person (in this section referred to as the **_vendor_**) from whom the acquirer acquired those shares or those assets, as the case may be, was involved in the contravention; and

                     (c)  at the time when the finding referred to in paragraph (b) is made, any of those shares or those assets, as the case may be, are vested in the acquirer or, if the acquirer is a body corporate, in any body corporate that is related to the acquirer;

the Court may, on the application of the Commission, declare that the acquisition, in so far as it relates to the shares or assets referred to in paragraph (c), is void as from the day on which it took place and, where the Court makes such a declaration:

                     (d)  the shares or the assets to which the declaration relates shall be deemed not to have been disposed of by the vendor; and

                     (e)  the vendor shall refund to the acquirer any amount paid to the vendor in respect of the acquisition of the shares or assets to which the declaration relates.

          (1B)  Where a declaration has been made under subsection 50A(1) in relation to the obtaining of a controlling interest in a corporation, or in each of 2 or more corporations, the Court may, on the application of the Minister or the Commission, if it finds, or has in a proceeding instituted under section 80 found, that that corporation, or any of those corporations, as the case may be (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant corporation_**), has contravened subsection 50A(6), by order, for the purpose of ensuring that the obtaining of that controlling interest ceases to have the result referred to in paragraph 50A(1)(a), direct the relevant corporation to dispose of such of its assets as are specified in the order within such period as is so specified.

          (1C)  Where an application is made to the Court for an order under subsection (1) or a declaration under subsection (1A), the Court may, instead of making an order under subsection (1) for the purpose of securing the disposal by a person of shares or assets or an order under subsection (1A) that the acquisition by a person of shares or assets is void, accept, upon such conditions (if any) as the Court thinks fit, an undertaking by the person to dispose of other shares or assets owned by the person.

             (2)  An application under subsection (1), (1A) or (1B) may be made at any time within 3 years after the date on which the contravention occurred.

             (3)  Where an application for directions under subsection (1) or for a declaration under subsection (1A) has been made, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection, the Court may, if the Court determines it to be appropriate, give directions or make a declaration by consent of all the parties to the proceedings, whether or not the Court has made the findings referred to in subsections (1) and (1A).

##### <a id="81A"></a>81A  Divestiture where merger done under clearance or authorisation granted on false etc. information

Circumstances when this section applies

             (1)  This section applies if the Court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  a person (the **_acquirer_**) has acquired shares in the capital of a body corporate or assets of another person; and

                     (b)  before the acquisition, the acquirer was granted, under Division 3 of Part VII (mergers), a clearance or an authorisation for the acquisition on the basis of information that was false or misleading in a material particular; and

                     (c)  that information was provided by the acquirer or a body corporate that was related to the acquirer; and

                     (d)  the Court or another court has found that the acquirer or related body corporate has contravened section 95AZN or Part 7.4 of the _Criminal Code_ by giving that information; and

                     (e)  if that information had not been given, the clearance or authorisation would not have been granted; and

                      (f)  apart from the clearance or authorisation, the acquisition would have contravened section 50; and

                     (g)  any or all of those shares or assets are vested in the acquirer, the related body corporate or any other body corporate that is related to the acquirer.

Divestiture by the acquirer and related bodies corporate

             (2)  The Court may, on the application of the Commission, by order, give directions for the purpose of securing the disposal of all or any of those shares or assets by the acquirer, the related body corporate or any other body corporate that is related to the acquirer.

             (3)  However, the Court must not make an order under subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  the acquirer was granted, under Division 3 of Part VII, both a clearance and an authorisation for the acquisition; and

                     (b)  the matters in subsection (1) are not satisfied in relation to both the clearance and the authorisation.

Example:    If a clearance for an acquisition was granted by the Commission on the basis of false or misleading information, and an authorisation for the acquisition was granted by the Tribunal on the basis of true information, then the Court cannot make an order under subsection (2) because subsection (1) would not be satisfied in relation to the authorisation.

Declaration that acquisition void—when vendor involved

             (4)  In addition to being satisfied of the matters in subsection (1), if the Court, or another court, has found that the person (the **_vendor_**) from whom the acquirer acquired the shares or assets was involved in the contravention referred to in paragraph (1)(d), then the Court may, on the application of the Commission, by order, declare that the acquisition, in so far as it relates to those shares or assets, is void as from the day on which it occurred.

             (5)  If the Court makes an order under subsection (4), then:

                     (a)  the shares or assets to which the declaration relates are taken not to have been disposed of by the vendor; and

                     (b)  the vendor must refund to the acquirer any amount paid to the vendor for acquiring the shares or assets.

             (6)  However, the Court must not make an order under subsection (4) if:

                     (a)  the acquirer was granted, under Division 3 of Part VII, both a clearance and an authorisation for the acquisition; and

                     (b)  the matters in subsections (1) and (4) are not satisfied in relation to both the clearance and the authorisation.

Alternative to orders under subsections (2) and (4)

             (7)  If an application is made to the Court for an order under subsection (2) or (4) against a person, the Court may, instead of making an order of the kind mentioned in that subsection, accept, upon such conditions (if any) as the Court thinks fit, an undertaking by the person to dispose of other shares or assets owned by the person.

When application for orders under this section must be made

             (8)  An application under subsection (2) or (4) may be made at any time within 3 years after the day on which the acquisition occurred.

Court may make orders even if not satisfied of all matters

             (9)  If an application for an order under subsection (2) or (4) is made, the Court may, if the Court determines it to be appropriate, make an order by consent of all the parties to the proceedings, whether or not the Court is satisfied of:

                     (a)  for an order under subsection (2)—the matters in subsection (1); and

                     (b)  for an order under subsection (4)—the matters in subsections (1) and (4).

##### <a id="82"></a>82  Actions for damages

             (1)  A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of a provision of Part IV or IVB may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention.

## Part VIA—Proportionate liability for misleading and deceptive conduct

##### <a id="87CB"></a>87CB  Application of Part

             (1)  This Part applies to a claim (an **_apportionable claim_**) if the claim is a claim for damages made under section 236 of the Australian Consumer Law for:

                     (a)  economic loss; or

                     (b)  damage to property;

caused by conduct that was done in a contravention of section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, there is a single apportionable claim in proceedings in respect of the same loss or damage even if the claim for the loss or damage is based on more than one cause of action (whether or not of the same or a different kind).

             (3)  In this Part, a **_concurrent wrongdoer_**, in relation to a claim, is a person who is one of 2 or more persons whose acts or omissions (or act or omission) caused, independently of each other or jointly, the damage or loss that is the subject of the claim.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Part, apportionable claims are limited to those claims specified in subsection (1).

             (5)  For the purposes of this Part, it does not matter that a concurrent wrongdoer is insolvent, is being wound up or has ceased to exist or died.

##### <a id="87CC"></a>87CC  Certain concurrent wrongdoers not to have benefit of apportionment

             (1)  Nothing in this Part operates to exclude the liability of a concurrent wrongdoer (an **_excluded concurrent wrongdoer_**) in proceedings involving an apportionable claim if:

                     (a)  the concurrent wrongdoer intended to cause the economic loss or damage to property that is the subject of the claim; or

                     (b)  the concurrent wrongdoer fraudulently caused the economic loss or damage to property that is the subject of the claim.

             (2)  The liability of an excluded concurrent wrongdoer is to be determined in accordance with the legal rules (if any) that (apart from this Part) are relevant.

             (3)  The liability of any other concurrent wrongdoer who is not an excluded concurrent wrongdoer is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Part.

##### <a id="87CD"></a>87CD  Proportionate liability for apportionable claims

             (1)  In any proceedings involving an apportionable claim:

                     (a)  the liability of a defendant who is a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to that claim is limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the court considers just having regard to the extent of the defendant’s responsibility for the damage or loss; and

                     (b)  the court may give judgment against the defendant for not more than that amount.

             (2)  If the proceedings involve both an apportionable claim and a claim that is not an apportionable claim:

                     (a)  liability for the apportionable claim is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Part; and

                     (b)  liability for the other claim is to be determined in accordance with the legal rules, if any, that (apart from this Part) are relevant.

             (3)  In apportioning responsibility between defendants in the proceedings:

                     (a)  the court is to exclude that proportion of the damage or loss in relation to which the plaintiff is contributorily negligent under any relevant law; and

                     (b)  the court may have regard to the comparative responsibility of any concurrent wrongdoer who is not a party to the proceedings.

             (4)  This section applies in proceedings involving an apportionable claim whether or not all concurrent wrongdoers are parties to the proceedings.

             (5)  A reference in this Part to a defendant in proceedings includes any person joined as a defendant or other party in the proceedings (except as a plaintiff) whether joined under this Part, under rules of court or otherwise.

##### <a id="87CE"></a>87CE  Defendant to notify plaintiff of concurrent wrongdoer of whom defendant aware

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a defendant in proceedings involving an apportionable claim has reasonable grounds to believe that a particular person (the **_other person_**)may be a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim; and

                     (b)  the defendant fails to give the plaintiff, as soon as practicable, written notice of the information that the defendant has about:

                              (i)  the identity of the other person; and

                             (ii)  the circumstances that may make the other person a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim; and

                     (c)  the plaintiff unnecessarily incurs costs in the proceedings because the plaintiff was not aware that the other person may be a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim;

the court hearing the proceedings may order that the defendant pay all or any of those costs of the plaintiff.

             (2)  The court may order that the costs to be paid by the defendant be assessed on an indemnity basis or otherwise.

##### <a id="87CF"></a>87CF  Contribution not recoverable from defendant

                   A defendant against whom judgment is given under this Part as a concurrent wrongdoer in relation to an apportionable claim:

                     (a)  cannot be required to contribute to any damages or contribution recovered from another concurrent wrongdoer in respect of the apportionable claim (whether or not the damages or contribution are recovered in the same proceedings in which judgment is given against the defendant); and

                     (b)  cannot be required to indemnify any such wrongdoer.

##### <a id="87CG"></a>87CG  Subsequent actions

             (1)  In relation to an apportionable claim, nothing in this Part or any other law prevents a plaintiff who has previously recovered judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part of any damage or loss from bringing another action against any other concurrent wrongdoer for that damage or loss.

             (2)  However, in any proceedings in respect of any such action, the plaintiff cannot recover an amount of damages that, having regard to any damages previously recovered by the plaintiff in respect of the damage or loss, would result in the plaintiff receiving compensation for damage or loss that is greater than the damage or loss actually sustained by the plaintiff.

##### <a id="87CH"></a>87CH  Joining non‑party concurrent wrongdoer in the action

             (1)  The court may give leave for any one or more persons to be joined as defendants in proceedings involving an apportionable claim.

             (2)  The court is not to give leave for the joinder of any person who was a party to any previously concluded proceedings in respect of the apportionable claim.

##### <a id="87CI"></a>87CI  Application of Part

                   Nothing in this Part:

                     (a)  prevents a person being held vicariously liable for a proportion of an apportionable claim for which another person is liable; or

                     (b)  prevents a partner from being held severally liable with another partner for that proportion of an apportionable claim for which the other partner is liable; or

                     (c)  affects the operation of any other Act to the extent that it imposes several liability on any person in respect of what would otherwise be an apportionable claim.

##### <a id="87G"></a>87G  Date of discoverability

Definition

             (1)  The **_date of discoverability_** for the death or injury is the first date when the plaintiff in the proceeding knows or ought to know each of the following:

                     (a)  that the death or personal injury has occurred;

                     (b)  that the death or personal injury was attributable to a contravention of this Act;

                     (c)  that in the case of a personal injury—the injury was significant enough to justify bringing an action.

Constructive knowledge

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the plaintiff **_ought to know_** a fact if the plaintiff would have ascertained the fact had the plaintiff taken all reasonable steps before the date in question to ascertain the fact.

Use of the plaintiff’s conduct and statements

             (3)  In determining what the plaintiff knows or ought to have known, the court may have regard to the plaintiff’s conduct, and to the plaintiff’s oral or written statements.

Minors

             (4)  If the plaintiff is a minor, facts that a capable parent or guardian of the plaintiff knows or ought to know are taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to be facts that the plaintiff knows or ought to know.

                     (a)  the plaintiff is an incapacitated person; and

                     (b)  there is a guardian of the plaintiff, or other person to manage all or part of the plaintiff’s estate, under a law of a State or Territory relating to the protection of incapacitated persons;

facts that the guardian or other person knows or ought to know are taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to be facts that the plaintiff knows or ought to know.

Proceedings by personal representatives

             (6)  Despite subsection (1), if the plaintiff brings the proceeding in the capacity of the personal representative of a deceased person, the **_date of discoverability_** for the death or injury is the earliest of:

                     (a)  if, had the deceased person commenced a proceeding, in relation to the contravention to which the death or injury relates, before his or her death, the date of discoverability under subsection (1) would have occurred more than 3 years before the death—that date; or

                     (b)  if, at the time of the plaintiff’s appointment as personal representative, the plaintiff knew, or ought to have known, all of the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c)—the date of the appointment; or

                     (c)  if the first time at which the plaintiff knew, or ought to have known, all of the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c) was after the date of appointment—the date of that first time.

##### <a id="87H"></a>87H  Long‑stop period

             (1)  The **_long‑stop period_** for the death or injury of a person is:

                     (a)  the period of 12 years following the act or omission alleged to have caused the death or injury; or

                     (b)  that period as extended by the court.

             (2)  The court must not extend the period by more than 3 years beyond the date of discoverability for the death or injury.

             (3)  In considering whether to extend the period, the court must have regard to the justice of the case, and, in particular, must have regard to:

                     (a)  whether the passage of time has prejudiced a fair trial; and

                     (b)  the nature and extent of the person’s loss or damage; and

                     (c)  the nature of the defendant’s conduct alleged to have caused the death or injury; and

##### <a id="87J"></a>87J  The effect of minority or incapacity

             (1)  If:

                             (ii)  a person in a close relationship with a parent or guardian of the victim;

in working out whether the period of 3 years after the date of discoverability, or the long‑stop period, has expired, disregard any period:

                     (c)  before the victim turns 25; or

                     (d)  if the victim dies before turning 25—before the victim’s death.

             (2)  For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii), a person is taken to be in a **_close relationship_** with a parent or guardian of the victim if the person’s relationship with the parent or guardian is such that:

                     (a)  the person might influence the parent or guardian not to bring a claim on behalf of the victim against the person; or

                     (b)  the victim might be unwilling to disclose to the parent or guardian the acts, omissions or events in respect of which the cause of action is founded.

and, while such an authorization remains in force:

                     (c)  in the case of an authorization to make a contract or arrangement or to arrive at an understanding—subsection 45(2) does not prevent the corporation from making the contract or arrangement or arriving at the understanding in accordance with the authorization and giving effect in accordance with the authorization to any provision of the contract or arrangement so made or of the understanding so arrived at;

                     (d)  in the case of an authorization to give effect to a provision of a contract:

                             (ii)  subsection 45B(2) does not apply in relation to the covenant; or

                     (d)  in the case of an authorization to enforce the terms of a covenant:

                              (i)  the covenant is not unenforceable by reason of subsection 45B(1); and

             (7)  Subject to this Part, the Commission may, upon application by or on behalf of a person, grant an authorization to the person, and to any other person acting in concert with the first‑mentioned person, to engage in conduct to which section 45D, 45DA or 45DB would or might apply and, while such an authorization remains in force, that section does not apply in relation to the engaging in that conduct by the applicant and by any person acting in concert with the applicant.

          (7A)  Subject to this Part, the Commission may, on application by or on behalf of a person, grant an authorisation to the person to engage in conduct to which section 45E or 45EA would or might apply.

                     (b)  the particular conduct referred to in the authorization is conduct expressly required or permitted under a contract, an arrangement, an understanding or an industry code of practice;

then:

                     (c)  the authorization has effect as if it were also an authorization in the same terms to every other person named or referred to in the application for the authorization as a party or proposed party to the contract, arrangement, understanding or code; and

                     (d)  the authorization may be expressed so as to apply to or in relation to another person who becomes a party to the contract, arrangement, understanding or code at a time after the authorization is granted. 

       (8AB)  For the purposes of subsection (8AA), a reference in that subsection to a contract, an arrangement, an understanding or an industry code of practice includes a reference to a proposed contract, a proposed arrangement, a proposed understanding or a proposed industry code of practice (as the case requires).

                              (i)  making the arrangement in accordance with the authorisation; and

                             (ii)  giving effect, in accordance with the authorisation, to any provision of the arrangement so made; and

                     (d)  for an authorisation to give effect to a provision of a dual listed company arrangement—section 49 does not prevent the corporation from giving effect to the provision in accordance with the authorisation.

          (8C)  An authorisation granted by the Commission to a corporation under subsection (8B) has effect as if it were also an authorisation in the same terms to the other corporation named or referred to in the application for the authorisation as a party to the arrangement or proposed arrangement.

          (8D)  Subject to subsection 49(2), the Commission does not have power to grant an authorisation to a corporation to make a dual listed company arrangement if the arrangement has been made before the Commission makes a determination in respect of the application.

             (9)  Subject to this Part, the Commission may, upon application by or on behalf of a person, grant an authorisation to the person to acquire a controlling interest in a body corporate (within the meaning of section 50A) and, while such an authorisation remains in force, section 50A does not, to the extent specified in the authorisation, apply in relation to the acquisition of that controlling interest.

           (10)  An authorization to a corporation under subsection (1A) or (1) may be expressed so as to apply to or in relation to another person who:

                     (a)  in the case of an authorization to make a contract or arrangement or arrive at an understanding—becomes a party to the proposed contract or arrangement at a time after it is made or becomes a party to the proposed understanding at a time after it is arrived at; or

                     (b)  in the case of an authorization to give effect to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding—becomes a party to the contract, arrangement or understanding at a time after the authorization is granted.

           (11)  An authorization under subsection (5) may be expressed so as to apply to or in relation to another person who:

                     (a)  in the case of an authorization to require the giving of, or to give, a covenant—becomes bound by, or entitled to the benefit of, the proposed covenant at a time after the covenant is given; or

                     (b)  in the case of an authorization to enforce the terms of a covenant—becomes bound by, or entitled to the benefit of, the covenant at a time after the authorization is granted.

           (12)  The Commission does not have power to grant an authorization to a corporation to make a contract or arrangement, to arrive at an understanding or to require the giving of, or to give, a covenant if the contract or arrangement has been made, the understanding has been arrived at or the covenant has been given before the Commission makes a determination in respect of the application.

           (13)  An application made to the Commission under this section for an authorization in relation to a particular contract or proposed contract (including an application mentioned in subsection (8AA)) may be expressed to be made also in relation to another contract or proposed contract that is or will be, or in relation to two or more other contracts or proposed contracts that are or will be, in similar terms to the first‑mentioned contract or proposed contract and, where an application is so expressed, the Commission may grant a single authorization in respect of all the contracts or proposed contracts or may grant separate authorizations in respect of any one or more of the contracts or proposed contracts.

           (14)  Where an application made to the Commission under this section for an authorization in relation to a particular contract or proposed contract is expressed in accordance with subsection (13) to be made also in relation to another contract or contracts or proposed contract or proposed contracts:

                     (a)  the application shall set out:

                              (i)  the names of the parties to each other contract; and

                             (ii)  the names of the parties to each other proposed contract where those names are known to the applicant at the time when the application is made; and

                     (b)  if an authorization is granted in respect of a proposed contract the names of the parties to which were not so known to the applicant, the authorization shall, by force of this subsection, be deemed to be expressed to be subject to a condition that any party to the contract will, when so required by the Commission, furnish to the Commission the names of all the parties to the contract.

           (15)  In subsections (13) and (14):

                     (a)  **_contract_** includes an arrangement, understanding, industry code of practice or covenant and **_proposed contract_** has a corresponding meaning; and

                     (b)  the reference to the parties to a contract or proposed contract shall, for the purposes of the application of those subsections in relation to a covenant or proposed covenant by reason of paragraph (a) of this subsection, be read as a reference to the persons who are or will be, or but for subsection 45B(1) would be, respectively bound by, or entitled to the benefit of, the covenant or proposed covenant.

           (16)  A corporation that has made an application to the Commission for an authorisation, or a person other than a corporation who has made an application to the Commission for an authorisation under subsection (9), may at any time, by notice in writing to the Commission, withdraw the application.

##### <a id="89"></a>89  Procedure for applications and the keeping of a register

             (1)  To be valid, an application for an authorisation, a minor variation of an authorisation, a revocation of an authorisation, or a revocation of an authorisation and the substitution of another authorisation, must:

                     (a)  be in a form prescribed by the regulations and contain the information required by the form; and

                     (b)  be accompanied by any other information or documents prescribed by the regulations; and

                     (c)  be accompanied by the fee (if any) prescribed by the regulations.

          (1A)  If the Commission receives a purported application that it considers is not a valid application, it must, within 5 business days of receiving the purported application, give the person who made the purported application a written notice:

                     (a)  stating that the person has not made a valid application; and

                     (b)  giving reasons why the purported application does not comply with this Division.

          (1B)  For the purposes of subsection (1A), **_business day_** means a day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday in the Australian Capital Territory.

             (2)  If the Commission receives an application referred to in subsection (1), the Commission must cause notice of the receipt of that application to be made public in such manner as it thinks fit.

             (3)  The Commission must keep a register of:

                     (a)  applications for authorizations; and

                     (b)  applications for minor variations of authorizations; and

                     (c)  applications for, or the Commission’s proposals for, the revocation of authorizations; and 

                     (d)  applications for, or the Commission’s proposals for, the revocation of authorizations and the substitution of other authorizations;

including applications that have been withdrawn or proposals that have been abandoned.

             (4)  Subject to this section, the register kept under subsection (3) shall include:

                     (a)  any document furnished to the Commission in relation to an application or proposal referred to in subsection (3);

                    (aa)  any draft determination, and any summary of reasons, by the Commission that is furnished to a person under section 90A, or under that section as applied by section 91C;

                   (ab)  any record of a conference made in accordance with subsection 90A(8), or with that subsection as applied by section 91C, and any certificate in relation to a conference given under subsection 90A(9), or under that subsection as so applied;

                     (b)  particulars of any oral submission made to the Commission in relation to such an application or proposal; and

                     (c)  the determination of the Commission on such an application or proposal and the statement of the reasons given by the Commission for that determination.

             (5)  Where a person furnishes a document to the Commission in relation to an application or proposal referred to in subsection (3) or makes an oral submission to the Commission in relation to such an application or proposal, he or she may, at the time when the document is furnished or the submission is made, request that the document or a part of the document, or that particulars of the submission or of part of the submission, be excluded from the register kept under subsection (3) by reason of the confidential nature of any of the matters contained in the document or submission.

          (5A)  Where such a request is made:

                     (a)  if the document or the part of the document, or the submission or the part of the submission, to which the request relates contains particulars of:

                              (i)  a secret formula or process;

                             (ii)  the cash consideration offered for the acquisition of shares in the capital of a body corporate or assets of a person; or

                            (iii)  the current costs of manufacturing, producing or marketing goods or services;

                            the Commission shall exclude the document or the part of the document, or particulars of the submission or of the part of the submission, as the case may be, from the register kept under subsection (3); and

                     (b)  in any other case—the Commission may, if it is satisfied that it is desirable to do so by reason of the confidential nature of the matters contained in the document or the part of the document, or in the submission or the part of the submission, exclude the document or the part of the document, or particulars of the submission or of the part of the submission, as the case may be, from that register.

          (5B)  If the Commission refuses a request to exclude a document or a part of a document from the register kept under subsection (3), the Commission shall, if the person who furnished the document to the Commission so requires, return the document or part of the document to him or her and, in that case, paragraph (4)(a) does not apply in relation to the document or part of the document.

          (5C)  If the Commission refuses a request to exclude particulars of an oral submission or of part of an oral submission from the register kept under subsection (3), the person who made the submission may inform the Commission that he or she withdraws the submission or that part of the submission and, in that case, paragraph (4)(b) does not apply in relation to the submission or that part of the submission, as the case may be.

          (5D)  Where the Commission is satisfied that it is desirable to do so for any reason other than the confidential nature of matters contained in a document or submission, the Commission may exclude a document or part of a document referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or particulars referred to in paragraph (4)(b) from the register kept under subsection (3).

          (5E)  If a person requests, in accordance with subsection (5) that a document or a part of a document, or that particulars of a submission or of part of a submission, be excluded from the register kept under subsection (3), the document or part of the document, or particulars of the submission or of the part of the submission, shall not be included in that register until the Commission has made a determination in relation to the request.

             (6)  A document shall not be included in the register kept under subsection (3) if a direction in relation to that document was in force under paragraph 22(1)(b) of this Act  immediately before the commencement of the _Trade Practices Amendment Act 1977_.

          (5A)  The Commission must not make a determination granting an authorisation under subsection 88(1A) in respect of a provision of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding that would be, or might be, a cartel provision, unless the Commission is satisfied in all the circumstances:

                     (a)  that the provision would result, or be likely to result, in a benefit to the public; and

                     (b)  that the benefit would outweigh the detriment to the public constituted by any lessening of competition that would result, or be likely to result, if:

                              (i)  the proposed contract or arrangement were made, or the proposed understanding were arrived at; and

                             (ii)  the provision were given effect to.

          (5B)  The Commission must not make a determination granting an authorisation under subsection 88(1A) in respect of a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding that is or may be a cartel provision, unless the Commission is satisfied in all the circumstances:

                     (a)  that the provision has resulted, or is likely to result, in a benefit to the public; and

                     (b)  that the benefit outweighs or would outweigh the detriment to the public constituted by any lessening of competition that has resulted, or is likely to result, from giving effect to the provision.

             (6)  The Commission shall not make a determination granting an authorization under subsection 88(1), (5) or (8) in respect of a provision (not being a provision that is or may be an exclusionary provision) of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, in respect of a proposed covenant, or in respect of proposed conduct (other than conduct to which subsection 47(6) or (7) applies), unless it is satisfied in all the circumstances that the provision of the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, the proposed covenant, or the proposed conduct, as the case may be, would result, or be likely to result, in a benefit to the public and that that benefit would outweigh the detriment to the public constituted by any lessening of competition that would result, or be likely to result, if:

                     (a)  the proposed contract or arrangement were made, or the proposed understanding were arrived at, and the provision concerned were given effect to;

                     (b)  the proposed covenant were given, and were complied with; or

                     (c)  the proposed conduct were engaged in;

as the case may be.

             (8)  The Commission shall not:

                     (a)  make a determination granting:

                              (i)  an authorization under subsection 88(1) in respect of a provision of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding that is or may be an exclusionary provision; or

                             (ii)  an authorization under subsection 88(7) or (7A) in respect of proposed conduct; or

                            (iii)  an authorization under subsection 88(8) in respect of proposed conduct to which subsection 47(6) or (7) applies; or

                            (iv)  an authorisation under subsection 88(8A) for proposed conduct to which section 48 applies;

                            unless it is satisfied in all the circumstances that the proposed provision or the proposed conduct would result, or be likely to result, in such a benefit to the public that the proposed contract or arrangement should be allowed to be made, the proposed understanding should be allowed to be arrived at, or the proposed conduct should be allowed to take place, as the case may be; or

                     (b)  make a determination granting an authorization under subsection 88(1) in respect of a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding that is or may be an exclusionary provision unless it is satisfied in all the circumstances that the provision has resulted, or is likely to result, in such a benefit to the public that the contract, arrangement or understanding should be allowed to be given effect to.

          (8A)  The Commission must not make a determination granting an authorisation under subsection 88(8B) to make a dual listed company arrangement unless it is satisfied in all the circumstances that the making of the arrangement would result, or be likely to result, in such a benefit to the public (see subsection (9A)) that the arrangement should be allowed to be made.

          (8B)  The Commission must not make a determination granting an authorisation under subsection 88(8B) to give effect to a provision of a dual listed company arrangement unless it is satisfied in all the circumstances that the giving effect to the provision would result, or be likely to result, in such a benefit to the public (see subsection (9A)) that the provision should be allowed to be given effect to.

             (9)  The Commission shall not make a determination granting an authorization under subsection 88(9) in respect of the acquisition of a controlling interest in a body corporate within the meaning of section 50A unless it is satisfied in all the circumstances that the proposed acquisition would result, or be likely to result, in such a benefit to the public (see subsection (9A)) that the acquisition should be allowed to take place.

          (9A)  In determining what amounts to a benefit to the public for the purposes of subsections (8A), (8B) and (9):

                     (a)  the Commission must regard the following as benefits to the public (in addition to any other benefits to the public that may exist apart from this paragraph):

                              (i)  a significant increase in the real value of exports;

                             (ii)  a significant substitution of domestic products for imported goods; and

                     (b)  without limiting the matters that may be taken into account, the Commission must take into account all other relevant matters that relate to the international competitiveness of any Australian industry.

           (10)  If the Commission does not determine an application for an authorisation (other than an application for an authorisation under subsection 88(9)) within the relevant period, then it is taken to have granted the application at the end of that period.

        (10A)  For the purposes of subsection (10), the **_relevant period_** is the period of 6 months beginning on the day the Commission received the application. However, if, before the end of that 6 month period:

                     (a)  the Commission has prepared a draft determination under subsection 90A(1) in relation to the application; and

                     (b)  the Commission determines in writing that that period is extended by a specified period of not more than 6 months; and

                     (c)  the applicant agrees to that period being so extended;

the **_relevant period_** is that period as so extended.

           (11)  Subject to subsections (12) and (13), if the Commission does not determine an application for an authorisation under subsection 88(9) within:

                     (a)  30 days from the day on which the application is received by the Commission; or

                     (b)  if the Commission, before the end of that period of 30 days, gives to the applicant a notice in writing requesting the applicant to give to the Commission additional information relevant to the determination of the application—the period consisting of 30 days from the day on which the application is received by the Commission increased by the number of days in the period commencing on the day on which the notice is given to the applicant and ending on the day on which the applicant gives to the Commission such of the additional information as the applicant is able to provide;

the Commission shall be deemed to have granted, at the end of that period, the authorisation applied for.

        (11A)  The Commission may, within the 30 day period mentioned in subsection (11), notify the applicant in writing that the Commission considers that the period should be extended to 45 days due to the complexity of the issues involved. If the Commission so notifies the applicant, the references in subsection (11) to 30 days are to be treated as references to 45 days.

           (12)  If the applicant for an authorization informs the Commission in writing before the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (11) (in this subsection and in subsection (13) referred to as the **_base period_**) that the applicant agrees to the Commission taking a specified longer period for the determination of the application, a reference to that longer period shall be deemed for the purposes of that application to be substituted in subsection (11) for the reference in that subsection to the base period.

           (13)  For the purposes of any application of subsection (12), a reference in that subsection to the base period shall, if a reference to another period is deemed by any other application or applications of that subsection to have been substituted in subsection (11) for the reference in subsection (11) to the base period, be construed as a reference to that other period.

           (14)  If a person to whom a notice has been sent under subsection 90A(2) in relation to a draft determination in respect of an application for an authorization notifies the Commission in accordance with subsection 90A(6) that he or she wishes the Commission to hold a conference in relation to the draft determination, the relevant period (worked out under subsection (10A) of this section) shall be deemed to be increased by a period equal to the period commencing on the day on which the first notification in relation to the draft determination was received by the Commission and ending on the seventh day after the day specified in the certificate given by a member of the Commission in pursuance of subsection 90A(9) as the day on which the conference terminated.

           (15)  Where a party to a joint venture makes at the one time two or more applications for authorizations (other than an application for an authorisation under subsection 88(9)), being applications each of which deals with a matter relating to the joint venture:

                     (a)  the Commission shall not make a determination in respect of any one of those applications unless it also makes a determination or determinations at the same time in respect of the other application or other applications; and

                     (b)  if the Commission does not make a determination in respect of any one of the applications within the relevant period (worked out under subsection (10A)) in relation to that application, the Commission shall be deemed to have granted, at the expiration of that period, all the authorizations applied for.

##### <a id="90A"></a>90A  Commission to afford opportunity for conference before determining application for authorisation

             (1)  Before determining an application for an authorization (other than an application for an authorisation under subsection 88(9)), the Commission shall prepare a draft determination in relation to the application.

             (2)  The Commission shall, by notice in writing sent to the applicant and to each other interested person, invite the applicant or other person to notify the Commission, within 14 days after a date fixed by the Commission being not earlier than the day on which the notice is sent, whether the applicant or other person wishes the Commission to hold a conference in relation to the draft determination.

                     (a)  the draft determination provides for the granting of the application unconditionally; and

                     (b)  no person has made a written submission to the Commission opposing the application;

each notice by the Commission under subsection (2) shall inform the person to whom the notice is sent that the draft determination so provides.

             (4)  If:

                     (b)  the draft determination provides for the granting of the application unconditionally but a written submission has, or written submissions have, been made to the Commission opposing the application;

the Commission shall send with each notice under subsection (2) a copy of the draft determination and:

                     (c)  in a case to which paragraph (a) applies—a summary of the reasons why the Commission is not satisfied that the application should be granted or why it is not satisfied that the application should be granted unconditionally; or

                     (d)  in a case to which paragraph (b) applies—a summary of the reasons why it is satisfied that the application should be granted unconditionally.

             (5)  If each of the persons to whom a notice was sent under subsection (2):

                     (a)  notifies the Commission within the period of 14 days mentioned in that subsection that he or she does not wish the Commission to hold a conference in relation to the draft determination; or

                     (b)  does not notify the Commission within that period that he or she wishes the Commission to hold such a conference;

the Commission may make the determination at any time after the expiration of that period.

             (6)  If any of the persons to whom a notice was sent under subsection (2) notifies the Commission in writing within the period of 14 days mentioned in that subsection that he or she wishes the Commission to hold a conference in relation to the draft determination, the Commission shall appoint a date (being not later than 30 days after the expiration of that period), time and place for the holding of the conference and give notice of the date, time and place so appointed to each of the persons to whom a notice was sent under subsection (2).

             (7)  At the conference:

                     (a)  the Commission shall be represented by a member or members of the Commission (being a member or members who participated in the preparation of the draft determination) nominated by the Chairperson; and

                     (b)  each person to whom a notice was sent under subsection (2) and any other interested person whose presence at the conference is considered by the Commission to be appropriate is entitled to attend and participate personally or, in the case of a body corporate, may be represented by a person who, or by persons each of whom, is a director, officer or employee of the body corporate; and

                     (c)  a person participating in the conference in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) is entitled to have another person or other persons present to assist him or her but a person who so assists another person at the conference is not entitled to participate in the discussion; and

                     (e)  no other person is entitled to be present.

             (8)  A member of the Commission participating in the conference shall make such record of the discussions as is sufficient to set out the matters raised by the persons participating in the conference.

             (9)  The member of the Commission who represents the Commission at the conference, or, if the Commission is represented by more than one member of the Commission, one of those members appointed by the Chairperson:

                     (c)  shall give a certificate certifying the day on which the first notification under subsection (6) in relation to the draft determination was received by the Commission and the day on which the conference terminated;

and any such certificate shall be received in all courts as evidence of the matters certified.

           (10)  A document purporting to be a certificate referred to in subsection (9) shall, unless the contrary is established, be deemed to be such a certificate and to have been duly given.

           (11)  The Commission shall take account of all matters raised at the conference and may at any time after the termination of the conference make a determination in respect of the application.

           (12)  For the purposes of this section,**_interested person_** means a person who has notified the Commission in writing that he or she, or a specified unincorporated association of which he or she is a member, claims to have an interest in the application, being an interest that, in the opinion of the Commission, is real and substantial.

           (13)  Where the Commission is of the opinion that two or more applications for authorizations that are made by the same person, or by persons being bodies corporate that are related to each other, involve the same or substantially similar issues, the Commission may treat the applications as if they constitute a single application and may prepare one draft determination in relation to the applications and hold one conference in relation to that draft determination.

##### <a id="90B"></a>90B  Commission may rely on consultations undertaken by the AEMC

             (1)  This section applies if:

##### <a id="91"></a>91  Grant and variation of authorisations

             (1)  An authorization may be expressed to be in force for a period specified in the authorization and, if so expressed, remains in force for that period only.

          (1A)  An authorisation, other than an authorisation deemed to have been granted under subsection 90(10) or (11), comes into force on the day specified for the purpose in the authorisation, not being a day earlier than, and an authorisation deemed to have been granted under subsection 90(10) or (11) comes into force on:

                     (a)  where paragraph (b) or (c) does not apply—the end of the period in which an application may be made to the Tribunal for a review of the determination by the Commission of the application for the authorisation;

                     (b)  if such an application is made to the Tribunal and the application is not withdrawn—the day on which the Tribunal makes a determination on the review;

                     (c)  if such an application is made to the Tribunal and the application is withdrawn—the day on which the application is withdrawn.

          (1B)  A minor variation of an authorization comes into force on a day specified by the Commission in the determination making the variation, not being a day earlier than:

                     (a)  if neither paragraph (b) nor (c) applies—the end of the period in which an application may be made to the Tribunal for a review of the determination of the Commission in respect of the application for the minor variation; or

                     (b)  if such an application is made to the Tribunal and the application is not withdrawn—the day on which the Tribunal makes a determination on the review; or

                     (c)  if such an application is made to the Tribunal and the application is withdrawn—the day on which the application is withdrawn.

          (1C)  If an authorization (the **_prior authorization_**) is revoked and another authorization is made in substitution for it, that other authorization comes into force on the day specified for the purpose in that other authorization, not being a day earlier than:

                     (a)  if neither paragraph (b) nor (c) applies—the end of the period in which an application may be made to the Tribunal for a review of an application, or the Commission’s proposal, for the revocation of the prior authorization and the substitution of that other authorization; or

                     (b)  if such an application is made to the Tribunal and the application is not withdrawn—the day on which the Tribunal makes a determination on the review; or

                     (c)  if such an application is made to the Tribunal and the application is withdrawn—the day on which the application is withdrawn.

             (2)  If the Commission considers that it is appropriate to do so:

                     (a)  for the purpose of enabling due consideration to be given to:

                              (i)  an application for an authorization; or 

                             (ii)  an application for a minor variation of an authorization; or

                            (iii)  an application for the revocation of an authorization and the substitution of a new one; or

                     (b)  pending the expiration of the time allowed for the making of an application to the Tribunal for review of a determination by the Commission of an application referred to in paragraph (a) and, if such an application for a review is made, pending the making of a determination by the Tribunal on the review; or

                     (c)  for any other reason;

the Commission may at any time:

                     (d)  in the case of an application for an authorization—grant an authorization that is expressed to be an interim authorization; and

                     (e)  in the case of an application for a minor variation of an authorization—grant an authorization that is expressed to be an interim authorization dealing only with the matter the subject of the application for a variation; and

                      (f)  in the case of an application for the revocation of an authorization and the substitution of another—suspend the operation of the authorization sought to be revoked and grant an authorization that is expressed to be an interim authorization in substitution for the authorization suspended.

       (2AA)  An authorization granted under paragraph 91(2)(d), (e) or (f) and expressed to be an interim authorization comes into force on such a date, not being a date before the grant of the interim authorization, as is specified by the Commission in the interim authorization.

       (2AB)  The Commission may, at any time, revoke an authorization that is expressed to be an interim authorization and, where that interim authorization is in substitution for an authorization the operation of which has been suspended, the revocation of the interim authorization has the effect of reviving the operation of the suspended authorization.

          (2A)  Subsections 90(4) to (9), inclusive, do not apply in relation to an authorization that is expressed to be an interim authorization.

             (3)  An authorization may be expressed to be subject to such conditions as are specified in the authorization.

                     (a)  indicate the nature of the variation applied for; and

                     (b)  invite submissions in respect of the variation within a period specified by the Commission.

Note:          Alternatively, the Commission may rely on consultations undertaken by the AEMC: see section 90B.

             (3)  After considering the application and any submissions received within the period specified, the Commission may make a determination in writing varying the authorization or dismissing the application.

             (4)  The Commission must not make a determination varying an authorization to which, if it were a new authorization, subsection 90(5A), (5B), (6) or (7) would apply, unless the Commission is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, the variation would not result, or would be likely not to result, in a reduction in the extent to which the benefit to the public of the authorization outweighs any detriment to the public caused by the authorization.

             (5)  The Commission must not make a determination varying an authorization to which, if it were a new authorization, subsection 90(8), (8A), (8B) or (9) would apply, unless the Commission is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, the variation would not result, or would be likely not to result, in a reduction in the benefit to the public that arose from the original authorization.

             (6)  Nothing in this section prevents a person from applying for 2 or more variations in the same application.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  a person applies for 2 or more variations:

                              (i)  at the same time; or

                             (ii)  in such close succession that the variations could conveniently be dealt with by the Commission at the same time; and

                     (b)  the Commission is satisfied that the combined effect of those variations, if all were granted, would not involve a material change in the effect of the authorization;

the Commission may deal with all of those variations together as if they were a single minor variation.

             (8)  An application for a minor variation may be withdrawn by notice in writing to the Commission at any time.

##### <a id="91B"></a>91B  Revocation of an authorization

             (6)  An application for revocation may be withdrawn by notice in writing to the Commission at any time.

Note:          Alternatively, the Commission may rely on consultations undertaken by the AEMC: see section 90B.

             (3)  If, at any time after granting an authorization, it appears to the Commission that:

                     (a)  the authorization was granted on the basis of evidence or information that was false or misleading in a material particular; or

             (6)  For the purposes of complying with section 90A in accordance with subsection (5), section 90A has effect:

                     (a)  as if the reference in subsection (1) to an application for an authorization (other than an application for an authorization under subsection 88(9)) were a reference to an application, or to a proposal, for the revocation of an authorization (other than an authorization granted on an application granted under subsection 88(9)) and the substitution of another authorization; and

                     (b)  as if references in other provisions of that section to an application, or to an application for an authorization, were references either to an application, or to a proposal, for the revocation of an authorization and the substitution of another; and

### Division 3—Merger clearances and authorisations

#### Subdivision A—Preliminary

##### <a id="95AA"></a>95AA  Simplified outline of this Division

* * *

This Division is about merger clearances and merger authorisations.

It relates to section 50: that section prohibits a person acquiring shares in the capital of a body corporate or assets of another person if the acquisition would have, or be likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market. If a person has a clearance or authorisation for the acquisition, section 50 will not prevent the person from making the acquisition.

The main differences between merger clearances and authorisations are:

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt;page-break-after:avoid">•      different

bodies decide whether they should be granted;</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt;page-break-after:avoid">•      different

#### Subdivision B—Merger clearances

##### <a id="95AC"></a>95AC  Commission may grant clearance for a merger

             (1)  The Commission may grant a clearance to a person:

                     (a)  to acquire shares in the capital of a body corporate; or

                     (b)  to acquire assets of another person.

Note:          Section 95AN prohibits the Commission from granting a clearance for an acquisition unless the Commission is satisfied that the acquisition would not have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition.

             (2)  If the Commission does so, then section 50 does not prevent the person from acquiring the shares or assets in accordance with the clearance.

Note:          The acquisition will only be protected from the operation of section 50 if it takes place in accordance with the clearance. If it does not, then section 50 will apply to the acquisition. If the acquisition contravenes section 50, then the remedies in Part VI will apply (see, for example, penalties under section 76 and divestiture under section 81).

             (3)  Without limiting subsection (2), an acquisition will not be in accordance with a clearance if any conditions of the clearance are not complied with (whether the conditions are to be complied with before, during or after the acquisition).

##### <a id="95AD"></a>95AD  Application for clearance

                     (c)  be accompanied by the fee (if any) prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  The regulations may prescribe that the application form contain a requirement that the applicant give an undertaking under section 87B that the applicant will not make the acquisition while the application is being considered by the Commission.

##### <a id="95AF"></a>95AF  Commission to notify if clearance application is invalid

                   If the Commission receives a purported application that it considers is not a valid application, it must, within 5 business days of receiving the purported application, give the person who made the purported application a written notice:

                     (a)  stating that the person has not made a valid application; and

                     (b)  giving reasons why the purported application does not comply with this Division.

                     (a)  any document given to the Commission in relation to an application or proposal referred to in subsection (1); and

                     (b)  particulars of any oral submission made to the Commission in relation to such an application or proposal; and

                     (c)  the determination of the Commission on such an application or proposal and the statement of the reasons given by the Commission for that determination;

unless section 95AI (confidentiality) prevents the inclusion.

##### <a id="95AI"></a>95AI  Confidentiality claims etc.

Requests for confidential treatment

             (1)  If a person gives information to the Commission in relation to an application or proposal referred to in subsection 95AH(1), the person may, at the time of giving the information, request that the information be excluded from the merger clearance register and the Commission’s website because of its confidential nature.

             (5)  If the Commission refuses such a request and the information is contained in a document, the Commission must, if the person who gave the document to it so requires, return the document or part of the document to the person. In that case, it must exclude the document or the part of the document (as the case requires) from the register and its website.

If request refused, oral submission may be withdrawn

             (6)  If the Commission refuses such a request and the information was given by way of oral submission, the person who made the submission may withdraw all or part of the submission. In that case, the Commission must exclude the submission or part of the submission (as the case requires) from the register and its website.

When Commission may exclude information—no request made

             (7)  The Commission may exclude information from the register and its website if it is satisfied that it is desirable to do so for any reason other than the confidential nature of the information.

##### <a id="95AJ"></a>95AJ  Commission may seek additional information from applicant

                     (b)  refusing to grant the clearance.

Note:          The Commission must make its determination within the time limit set out in section 95AO. If it does not, then it is taken to have refused to grant the clearance.

             (2)  In making its determination, the Commission must take into account:

                     (a)  any submissions in relation to the application made to it by the applicant, the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or any other person that are received within the period specified under paragraph 95AG(b); and

                     (b)  any information received under section 95AJ within the period specified in the relevant notice under that section; and

Note 2:       If an acquisition takes place without complying with a condition of the clearance (whether the condition is to be complied with before, during or after the acquisition), the acquisition will not be in accordance with the clearance and so might contravene section 50 (see subsections 95AC(2) and (3)). If the acquisition contravenes section 50, then the remedies in Part VI will apply (see, for example, penalties under section 76 and divestiture under section 81).

Note 1:       Section 95AZH prohibits the Tribunal from granting an authorisation for an acquisition unless the Tribunal is satisfied the acquisition would result, or be likely to result, in such a benefit to the public that the acquisition should be allowed to take place.

then, subject to subsection (2), it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is established, that that matter or circumstance was the reason for the defendant’s so acting.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply where the plaintiff establishes the matter mentioned in paragraph 98(1)(b) or (c) but the terms disadvantageous to the plaintiff, or the less favourable treatment of the plaintiff, consisted only of a requirement by the defendant as to the time at which, or the form in which, payment was to be made or as to the giving of security to secure payment.

             (3)  In the application of this section in proceedings by the Commission for an injunction, references to the plaintiff shall be construed as references to a person specified in the application for the injunction as the person in relation to whom the defendant is claimed to have acted as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).
