                     (b)  the commercial rental arrangement is entered into in the ordinary course of a business conducted by the program owner; and

                     (c)  the program owner was conducting the same business, or another business that consisted of, or included, the making of commercial rental arrangements in respect of computer programs, when the copy was purchased.

                   A person (including a carrier or carriage service provider) who provides facilities for making, or facilitating the making of, a communication is not taken to have authorised any infringement of copyright in a work merely because another person uses the facilities so provided to do something the right to do which is included in the copyright.

For this purpose, disregard a temporary reproduction of the work incidentally made as a necessary part of the technical process of making the main copy.

             (2)  The making of the main copy is not an infringement of copyright in the work or a published edition of the work.

Dealing with main copy may make it an infringing copy

             (3)  Subsection (2) is taken never to have applied if the main copy is:

                     (a)  sold; or

                     (b)  let for hire; or

                     (c)  by way of trade offered or exposed for sale or hire; or

                     (d)  distributed for the purpose of trade or otherwise.

Note:          If the main copy is dealt with as described in subsection (3), then copyright may be infringed not only by the making of the main copy but also by the dealing with the main copy.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, paragraph (3)(d) does not apply to a loan of the main copy by the lender to a member of the lender’s family or household for the member’s private and domestic use.

Reproducing work from main copy may infringe copyright

             (5)  Subsection (2) does not prevent the main copy from being an infringing copy for the purpose of working out whether this section applies again in relation to the making of another reproduction of the work from the main copy.

Disposal of book etc. may make the main copy an infringing copy

             (6)  Subsection (2) is taken never to have applied if the owner of the book, newspaper or periodical publication disposes of it (in the form from which the main copy was made) to another person.

Status of temporary reproduction

             (7)  If subsection (2) applies to the making of the main copy only as a result of disregarding the incidental making of a temporary reproduction of the work as a necessary part of the technical process of making the main copy, then:

                     (a)  if the temporary reproduction is destroyed at the first practicable time during or after the making of the main copy—the making of the temporary reproduction does not infringe copyright in the work or a published edition of the work; or

                     (b)  if the temporary reproduction is not destroyed at that time—the making of the temporary reproduction is taken always to have infringed copyright (if any) subsisting in the work and the published edition of the work from which the main copy was made.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Inclusion of works in collections for use by places of education

             (1)  The copyright in a published literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is not infringed by the inclusion of a short extract from the work, or, in the case of a published literary, dramatic or musical work, from an adaptation of the work, in a collection of literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works contained in a book, sound recording or cinematograph film and intended for use by places of education if:

                     (a)  the collection is described in an appropriate place in the book, on the label of each record embodying the recording or of its container, or in the film, as being intended for use by places of education;

                     (c)  the collection consists principally of matter in which copyright does not subsist; and

                     (d)  a sufficient acknowledgement of the work or adaptation is made.

             (2)  The last preceding subsection does not apply in relation to the copyright in a work if, in addition to the extract concerned, 2 or more other extracts from, or from adaptations of, works (being works in which copyright subsists at the time when the collection is published) by the author of the first-mentioned work are contained in that collection, or are contained in that collection taken together with every similar collection, if any, of works intended for use by places of education and published by the same publisher within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the publication of the first-mentioned collection.

                     (d)  the number of copies so imported is not more than the number of copies so ordered.

             (5)  Without limiting the ways in which a telephone order under subsection (3) or (4), or a statement under paragraph (3)(b) or (4)(c) relating to such an order, may be verified, such an order or statement is, for the purposes of this section, taken to be verifiable if the person who takes the order, or to whom the statement is made, makes a written note of the details of the order or statement when, or immediately after, the order is placed, or the statement is made, as the case may be.

             (6)  Where:

                     (a)  a book is imported into Australia for a purpose mentioned in paragraph 37(1)(a), (b) or (c); and

                     (b)  the importation does not, under this section, constitute an infringement of copyright in a published work;

                   the use of the book for any such purpose does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the work and subsection 38(1) does not apply to the book.

             (7)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the importation of a copy of a hardback version of a non-infringing book into Australia if the copyright owner, or his or her licensee or agent, is able to supply in Australia enough copies of a paperback version of the book to fill any reasonable order.

             (8)  For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), a copyright owner, licensee or agent is not taken to have filled an order by a person for one or more copies of a version of a book unless and until the copyright owner, licensee or agent sends the copy, or all of the copies, as the case requires, to the person.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Reproduction for purpose of broadcasting

             (1)  Where the broadcasting by a person of a literary, dramatic or musical work, or of an adaptation of such a work, would not (whether by reason of an assignment or licence or of the operation of a provision of this Act) constitute an infringement of the copyright in the work, but the making by the person of a sound recording or a cinematograph film of the work or adaptation would, apart from this subsection, constitute such an infringement, the copyright in the work is not infringed by the making by the person of such a recording or film solely for the purpose of the broadcasting of the work or adaptation.

             (2)  The last preceding subsection does not apply in relation to a recording or film if a record embodying the recording or a copy of the film is used for a purpose other than:

                     (a)  the broadcasting of the work or adaptation in circumstances that do not (whether by reason of an assignment or licence or of the operation of a provision of this Act) constitute an infringement of the copyright in the work; or

                     (b)  the making of further records embodying the recording or further copies of the film for the purpose of the broadcasting of the work or adaptation in such circumstances.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a recording or film where a record embodying the recording or a copy of the film is used for the purpose of the broadcasting of the work or adaptation by a person who is not the maker of the recording or film unless the maker has paid to the owner of the copyright in the work such amount as they agree or, in default of agreement, has given an undertaking in writing to the owner to pay to the owner such amount as is determined by the Copyright Tribunal, on the application of either of them, to be equitable remuneration to the owner for the making of the recording or film.

             (4)  A person who has given an undertaking referred to in the last preceding subsection is liable, when the Copyright Tribunal has determined the amount to which the undertaking relates, to pay that amount to the owner of the copyright in the work and the owner may recover that amount in a court of competent jurisdiction from the person as a debt due to the owner.

             (6)  The owner of the copyright in a literary or dramatic work, or the agent of such an owner, may notify in writing a person who holds or held a print disability radio licence that the owner or agent wishes to inspect:

          (7A)  Subsection (7) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

          (7B)  Subsection (7) does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (7B) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (8)  Where:

                     (a)  a sound broadcast of, or of an adaptation of, a literary or dramatic work is made by a person (in this subsection referred to as the **_licence holder_**) being the holder of a print disability radio licence;

                     (b)  by virtue of subsection (1), the making of the sound broadcast does not infringe copyright in the work; and

                     (c)  the owner of the copyright in the work makes a request in writing at any time during the prescribed retention period after the making of the sound broadcast for payment for the making of the sound broadcast;

the licence holder shall pay to the owner of the copyright such an amount by way of equitable remuneration for the making of the sound broadcast as is agreed upon between the owner of the copyright and the licence holder or, in default of agreement, as is determined by the Copyright Tribunal on the application of either the owner of the copyright or the licence holder.

             (9)  Where the Copyright Tribunal has under subsection (8) determined the amount of equitable remuneration payable by a person to the owner of the copyright in a work, the owner of the copyright may recover that amount from the person in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due to the owner of the copyright.

           (10)  Nothing in this section affects the right of the owner of the copyright in a literary or dramatic work to grant a licence authorising a person being the holder of a print disability radio licence to make sound broadcasts of, or of adaptations of, the work without infringement of that copyright.

                     (b)  the reproduction or adaptation is made for the purpose of obtaining information necessary to enable the owner or licensee, or a person acting on behalf of the owner or licensee, to make independently another program (the **_new program_**),or an article, to connect to and be used together with, or otherwise to interoperate with, the original program or any other program; and

                     (c)  the reproduction or adaptation is made only to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain the information referred to in paragraph (b); and

### Division 4B—Acts not constituting infringements of copyright in artistic works

##### <a id="47J"></a>47J  Reproducing photograph in different format for private use

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the owner of a photograph (the **_original photograph_**) makes a reproduction (the **_main copy_**) of it for his or her private and domestic use instead of the original photograph; and

                     (b)  the original photograph itself is not an infringing copy of a work or published edition of a work; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  the original photograph is in hardcopy form and the main copy is in electronic form; or

                             (ii)  the original photograph is in electronic form and the main copy is in hardcopy form; and

                     (d)  at the time the owner makes the main copy, he or she has not made, and is not making, another reproduction of the original photograph that embodies the original photograph in a form substantially identical to the form of the main copy.

For this purpose, disregard a temporary reproduction of the original photograph incidentally made as a necessary part of the technical process of making the main copy.

             (2)  The making of the main copy is not an infringement of copyright:

                     (a)  in the original photograph; or

                     (b)  in a work, or published edition of a work, included in the original photograph.

Dealing with main copy may make it an infringing copy

             (3)  Subsection (2) is taken never to have applied if the main copy is:

                     (a)  sold; or

                     (b)  let for hire; or

                     (c)  by way of trade offered or exposed for sale or hire; or

                     (d)  distributed for the purpose of trade or otherwise.

Note:          If the main copy is dealt with as described in subsection (3), then copyright may be infringed not only by the making of the main copy but also by the dealing with the main copy.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, paragraph (3)(d) does not apply to a loan of the main copy by the lender to a member of the lender’s family or household for the member’s private and domestic use.

Reproducing main copy may infringe copyright

             (5)  Subsection (2) does not prevent the main copy from being an infringing copy for the purpose of working out whether this section applies again in relation to the making of a reproduction of the main copy.

Disposal of original may make the main copy an infringing copy

             (6)  Subsection (2) is taken never to have applied if the owner of the original photograph disposes of it to another person.

Status of temporary reproduction

             (7)  If subsection (2) applies to the making of the main copy only as a result of disregarding the incidental making of a temporary reproduction of the original photograph as a necessary part of the technical process of making the main copy, then:

                     (a)  if the temporary reproduction is destroyed at the first practicable time during or after the making of the main copy—the making of the temporary reproduction does not infringe copyright in the original photograph or a work, or published edition of a work, included in the original photograph; or

                     (b)  if the temporary reproduction is not destroyed at that time—the making of the temporary reproduction is taken always to have infringed copyright (if any) subsisting in the original photograph or a work, or published edition of a work, included in the original photograph.

### Division 5—Copying of works in libraries or archives

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Interpretation

                   In this Division, a reference to an article contained in a periodical publication shall be read as a reference to anything (other than an artistic work) appearing in such a publication.

##### <a id="48A"></a>48A  Copying by Parliamentary libraries for members of Parliament

                   The copyright in a work is not infringed by anything done, for the sole purpose of assisting a person who is a member of a Parliament in the performance of the person’s duties as such a member, by an authorized officer of a library, being a library the principal purpose of which is to provide library services for members of that Parliament.

##### <a id="49"></a>49  Reproducing and communicating works by libraries and archives for users

             (1)  A person may furnish to the officer in charge of a library or archives:

                     (a)  a request in writing to be supplied with a reproduction of an article, or a part of an article, contained in a periodical publication or of the whole or a part of a published work other than an article contained in a periodical publication, being a periodical publication or a published work held in the collection of a library or archives; and

                     (b)  a declaration signed by him or her stating:

                              (i)  that he or she requires the reproduction for the purpose of research or study and will not use it for any other purpose; and

                             (ii)  that he or she has not previously been supplied with a reproduction of the same article or other work, or the same part of the article or other work, as the case may be, by an authorized officer of the library or archives.

             (2)  Subject to this section, where a request and declaration referred to in subsection (1) are furnished to the officer in charge of a library or archives, an authorized officer of the library or archives may, unless the declaration contains a statement that to his or her knowledge is untrue in a material particular, make, or cause to be made, the reproduction to which the request relates and supply the reproduction to the person who made the request.

Note:          The reproduction could be made from another reproduction of the article or published work in the collection of the library or archives that was made without infringing copyright because of subsection 51A(1), to replace the article or published work because it was damaged, had deteriorated or had been lost or stolen.

          (2A)  A person may make to an authorized officer of a library or archives:

                     (a)  a request to be supplied with a reproduction of an article, or part of an article, contained in a periodical publication, or of the whole or a part of a published work other than an article contained in a periodical publication, being a periodical publication or a published work held in the collection of a library or archives; and

                     (b)  a declaration to the effect that:

                              (i)  the person requires the reproduction for the purpose of research or study and will not use it for any other purpose;

                             (ii)  the person has not previously been supplied with a reproduction of the same article or other work, or the same part of the article or other work, as the case may be, by an authorized officer of the library or archives; and

                            (iii)  by reason of the remoteness of the person’s location, the person cannot conveniently furnish to the officer in charge of the library or archives a request and declaration referred to in subsection (1) in relation to the reproduction soon enough to enable the reproduction to be supplied to the person before the time by which the person requires it.

          (2B)  A request or declaration referred to in subsection (2A) is not required to be made in writing.

          (2C)  Subject to this section, where:

                     (a)  a request and declaration referred to in subsection (2A) are made by a person to an authorized officer of a library or archives; and

                     (b)  the authorized officer makes a declaration setting out particulars of the request and declaration made by the person and stating that:

                              (i)  the declaration made by the person, so far as it relates to the matters specified in subparagraphs (2A)(b)(i) and (ii), does not contain a statement that, to the knowledge of the authorized officer, is untrue in a material particular; and

                             (ii)  the authorized officer is satisfied that the declaration made by the person is true so far as it relates to the matter specified in subparagraph (2A)(b)(iii);

an authorized officer of the library or archives may make, or cause to be made, the reproduction to which the request relates and supply the reproduction to the person.

Note:          The reproduction could be made from another reproduction of the article or published work in the collection of the library or archives that was made without infringing copyright because of subsection 51A(1), to replace the article or published work because it was damaged, had deteriorated or had been lost or stolen.

             (3)  Where a charge is made for making and supplying a reproduction to which a request under subsection (1) or (2A) relates, subsection (2) or (2C), as the case may be, does not apply in relation to the request if the amount of the charge exceeds the cost of making and supplying the reproduction.

             (4)  Subsection (2) or (2C) does not apply in relation to a request for a reproduction of, or parts of, 2 or more articles contained in the same periodical publication unless the articles are requested for the same research or course of study.

             (5)  Subsection (2) or (2C) does not apply to a request for a reproduction of the whole of a work (other than an article contained in a periodical publication), or to a reproduction of a part of such a work that contains more than a reasonable portion of the work unless:

                     (a)  the work forms part of the library or archives collection; and

                     (b)  before the reproduction is made, an authorized officer has, after reasonable investigation, made a declaration stating that he or she is satisfied that a reproduction (not being a second-hand reproduction) of the work cannot be obtained within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price.

       (5AA)  For the purposes of subsection (5), if the characteristics of the work are such that subsection 10(2) or (2A) is relevant to the question whether the reproduction contains only a reasonable portion of the work, then that question is to be determined solely by reference to subsection 10(2) or (2A) and not by reference to the ordinary meaning of **_reasonable portion_**.

        (5AB)  For the purposes of paragraph (5)(b), in determining whether a reproduction (not being a second-hand reproduction) of the work cannot be obtained within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price, the authorized officer must take into account:

                     (a)  the time by which the person requesting the reproduction requires it; and

                     (b)  the time within which a reproduction (not being a second-hand reproduction) of the work at an ordinary commercial price could be delivered to the person; and

                     (c)  whether an electronic reproduction of the work can be obtained within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price.

          (5A)  If an article contained in a periodical publication, or a published work (other than an article contained in a periodical publication) is acquired, in electronic form, as part of a library or archives collection, the officer in charge of the library or archives may make it available online within the premises of the library or archives in such a manner that users cannot, by using any equipment supplied by the library or archives:

                     (a)  make an electronic reproduction of the article or work; or

                     (b)  communicate the article or work.

             (6)  The copyright in an article contained in a periodical publication is not infringed by the making, in relation to a request under subsection (1) or (2A), of a reproduction of the article, or of a part of the article, in accordance with subsection (2) or (2C), as the case may be, unless the reproduction is supplied to a person other than the person who made the request.

             (7)  The copyright in a published work other than an article contained in a periodical publication is not infringed by the making, in relation to a request under subsection (1) or (2A), of a reproduction of the work, or of a part of the work, in accordance with subsection (2) or (2C), as the case may be, unless the reproduction is supplied to a person other than the person who made the request.

          (7A)  Subsections (6) and (7) do not apply to the making under subsection (2) or (2C) of an electronic reproduction of:

                     (a)  an article, or a part of an article, contained in a periodical publication; or

                     (b)  the whole or part of a published work, other than such an article;

in relation to a request under this section for communication to the person who made the request unless:

                     (c)  before or when the reproduction is communicated to the person, the person is notified in accordance with the regulations:

                              (i)  that the reproduction has been made under this section and that the article or work might be subject to copyright protection under this Act; and

                             (ii)  about such other matters (if any) as are prescribed; and

                     (d)  as soon as practicable after the reproduction is communicated to the person, the reproduction made under subsection (2) or (2C) and held by the library or archives is destroyed.

          (7B)  It is not an infringement of copyright in an article contained in a periodical publication, or of copyright in a published work, to communicate it in accordance with subsection (2), (2C) or (5A).

             (8)  The regulations may exclude the application of subsection (6) or (7) in such cases as are specified in the regulations.

             (9)  In this section:

                    <a name="archiv"></a>**_archives_** means an archives all or part of whose collection is accessible to members of the public.

                    <a name="librari"></a>**_library_** means a library all or part of whose collection is accessible to members of the public directly or through interlibrary loans.

                    <a name="suppli"></a>**_supply_** includes supply by way of a communication.

             (7)  Where:

                     (a)  a reproduction (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant reproduction_**) of, or of a part of, an article, or of the whole or a part of another work, is supplied under subsection (2) to the officer in charge of a library; and

the making of the record does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the literary or dramatic work.

             (2)  Where copyright does not subsist in the musical work, the amount to be paid in respect of the literary or dramatic work is an amount equal to the royalty that, but for this section, would have been payable in respect of the musical work if copyright had subsisted in the musical work.

             (3)  Where copyright subsists in the musical work as well as in the literary or dramatic work:

                     (a)  if the copyrights in those works are owned by the same person—an amount is not payable in respect of the literary or dramatic work; or

                     (b)  if the copyrights in those works are owned by different persons—the royalty that, but for this section, would have been payable in respect of the musical work shall be apportioned between them in such manner as they agree, or, in default of the agreement, as is determined by the Copyright Tribunal on the application of either of them.

             (4)  Where the owner of the copyright in a musical work and the owner of the copyright in a literary or dramatic work do not agree on the manner in which an amount is to be apportioned between them but the person who made the record gives an undertaking in writing to each owner to pay to him or her the portion of that amount that the Tribunal determines to be payable to him or her, then:

                     (a)  paragraph 55(1)(d) and paragraph (1)(e) of this section have effect as if the payments referred to in those paragraphs had been made; and

                     (b)  the person who made the record is liable, when the amount to which an undertaking relates is determined, to pay that amount to the owner of the copyright to whom the undertaking was given and the owner may recover that amount in a court of competent jurisdiction from that person as a debt due to the owner.

##### <a id="60"></a>60  Records made partly for retail sale and partly for gratuitous disposal

                   Where a person makes, in Australia, a number of records embodying the same sound recording, being a recording of a musical work or of a musical work and of words consisting or forming part of a literary or dramatic work, with the intention of:

                     (a)  selling by retail, or supplying for sale by retail by another person, a substantial proportion of the records (in this section referred to as **_the records made for retail sale_**); and

                     (b)  disposing gratuitously of the remainder of the records or supplying the remainder of the records for gratuitous disposal by another person;

this Division applies in relation to the records other than the records made for retail sale as if:

                     (c)  those records had been made with the intention of selling them by retail or of supplying them for sale by retail by another person;

                     (d)  the gratuitous disposal of those records by the maker of the records, or the supplying of those records by the maker of the records for gratuitous disposal by another person, were a sale of the records by retail; and

                     (e)  the retail selling price of those records were the same as the retail selling price of the records made for retail sale.

##### <a id="61"></a>61  Making inquiries in relation to previous records

                   Where:

                     (a)  a person makes inquiries, as prescribed, for the purpose of ascertaining whether a record of a musical work, or a record of a musical work in which words consisting or forming part of a literary or dramatic work were sung or spoken, has previously been made in, or imported into, Australia by, or with the licence of, the owner of the copyright in the musical work or in the literary or dramatic work, as the case may be, for the purpose of retail sale or for use in making other records for the purpose of retail sale; and

                     (b)  an answer to those inquiries is not received within the prescribed period;

a record of that musical work, or a record of that work in which those words were sung or spoken, as the case may be, shall, for the purposes of the application of this Division:

                     (c)  in relation to the person who made the inquiries; or

                     (d)  in relation to a person who makes records of the musical work, or records of that work in which those words or substantially the same words are sung or spoken, for the purpose of supplying those records to the person who made the inquiries in pursuance of an agreement entered into between those persons for the making of the records;

be taken to have been previously made in, or imported into, Australia with the licence of the owner of that copyright for the purpose of retail sale or for use in making other records for the purpose of retail sale, as the case may be.

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Sections 55 and 59 to be disregarded in determining whether an infringement has been committed by the importation of records

                   For the purpose of any provision of this Act relating to imported articles, in determining whether the making of a record made outside Australia would have constituted an infringement of copyright if the record had been made in Australia by the importer, sections 55 and 59 shall be disregarded.

### Division 7—Acts not constituting infringements of copyright in artistic works

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Sculptures and certain other works in public places

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Buildings and models of buildings

                   The copyright in a building or a model of a building is not infringed by the making of a painting, drawing, engraving or photograph of the building or model or by the inclusion of the building or model in a cinematograph film or in a television broadcast.

                   The copyright in an artistic work is not infringed by the publication of a painting, drawing, engraving, photograph or cinematograph film if, by virtue of section 65, section 66 or section 67, the making of that painting, drawing, engraving, photograph or film did not constitute an infringement of the copyright.

##### <a id="70"></a>70  Reproduction for purpose of including work in television broadcast

             (1)  Where the inclusion of an artistic work in a television broadcast made by a person would not (whether by reason of an assignment or licence or of the operation of a provision of this Act) constitute an infringement of copyright in the work but the making by the person of a cinematograph film of the work would, apart from this subsection, constitute such an infringement, the copyright in the work is not infringed by the making by the person of such a film solely for the purpose of the inclusion of the work in a television broadcast.

             (2)  The last preceding subsection does not apply in relation to a film if a copy of the film is used for a purpose other than:

                     (a)  the inclusion of the work in a television broadcast in circumstances that do not (whether by reason of an assignment or licence or of the operation of a provision of this Act) constitute an infringement of the copyright in the work; or

                     (b)  the making of further copies of the film for the purpose of the inclusion of the work in such a broadcast.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a film where a copy of the film is used for the purpose of the inclusion of the work in a television broadcast made by a person who is not the maker of the film unless the maker has paid to the owner of the copyright in the work such amount as they agree or, in default of agreement, has given an undertaking in writing to the owner to pay to the owner such amount as is determined by the Copyright Tribunal, on the application of either of them, to be equitable remuneration to the owner for the making of the film.

             (4)  A person who has given an undertaking referred to in the last preceding subsection is liable, when the Copyright Tribunal has determined the amount to which the undertaking relates, to pay that amount to the owner of the copyright in the work and the owner may recover that amount in a court of competent jurisdiction from the person as a debt due to the owner.

             (5)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a film unless, before the expiration of the period of 12 months commencing on the day on which any of the copies of the film is first used for including the work in a television broadcast in accordance with that subsection, or before the expiration of such further period, if any, as is agreed between the maker of the film and the owner of the copyright in the work, all the copies of the film are destroyed or are transferred, with the consent of the Director-General of the National Archives of Australia, to the care (within the meaning of the _Archives Act 1983_) of the National Archives of Australia.

             (6)  The Director-General of the National Archives of Australia must not consent to the transfer to the care of the National Archives of Australia in accordance with subsection (5) of a copy of a film unless he or she has certified that the film is of an exceptional documentary character.

                     (a)  before the commencement of the proceedings, an application for the registration of the design under the _Designs Act 1906_ in respect of those articles, or under the _Designs Act 2003_ in respect of those products, had been refused;

                     (b)  the reason, or one of the reasons, given for the refusal was that the design was excluded from registration under that Act by regulations made under that Act; and

                     (c)  when the proceedings were commenced, no appeal against the refusal had been allowed or was pending.

             (4)  The regulations may specify the circumstances in which a design is, for the purposes of this section, to be taken to be applied industrially.

             (1)  Subject to this section, the copyright in a published sound recording is not infringed by the making of a broadcast (other than a broadcast transmitted for a fee payable to the person who made the broadcast) of that recording if:

                     (a)  where there is no order of the Tribunal in force under section 152 applying to the maker of that broadcast in relation to the time when that broadcast was made—the maker of that broadcast has given an undertaking in writing to the person who is the owner of the copyright in that recording to pay to the owner such amounts (if any) as may be specified in, or determined in accordance with, an order of the Tribunal made under that section in respect of the broadcasting by the maker, during a period within which that broadcast was made, of published sound recordings in which the copyrights are owned by that person and which include that recording; or

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (5)(c), a supplying of records of a musical work shall be disregarded if the supplying was done otherwise than by, or with the licence of, the owner of the copyright in the work.

##### <a id="109A"></a>109A  Copying sound recordings for private and domestic use

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the owner of a copy (the **_earlier copy_**) of a sound recording makes another copy (the **_later copy_**) of the sound recording using the earlier copy; and

                     (b)  the sole purpose of making the later copy is the owner’s private and domestic use of the later copy with a device that:

                              (i)  is a device that can be used to cause sound recordings to be heard; and

                             (ii)  he or she owns; and

                     (c)  the earlier copy was not made by downloading over the internet a digital recording of a radio broadcast or similar program; and

                     (d)  the earlier copy is not an infringing copy of the sound recording, a broadcast or a literary, dramatic or musical work included in the sound recording.

             (2)  The making of the later copy does not infringe copyright in the sound recording, or in a literary, dramatic or musical work or other subject-matter included in the sound recording.

             (3)  Subsection (2) is taken never to have applied if the earlier copy or the later copy is:

                     (a)  sold; or

                     (b)  let for hire; or

                     (c)  by way of trade offered or exposed for sale or hire; or

                     (d)  distributed for the purpose of trade or otherwise; or

                     (e)  used for causing the sound recording to be heard in public; or

                      (f)  used for broadcasting the sound recording.

Note:          If the earlier or later copy is dealt with as described in subsection (3), then copyright may be infringed not only by the making of the later copy but also by a dealing with the later copy.

##### <a id="110"></a>110  Provisions relating to cinematograph films

             (1)  Where the visual images forming part of a cinematograph film consist wholly or principally of images that, at the time when they were first embodied in an article or thing, were means of communicating news, the copyright in the film is not infringed by the causing of the film to be seen or heard, or to be both seen and heard, in public after the expiration of 50 years after the expiration of the calendar year in which the principal events depicted in the film occurred.

             (2)  Where, by virtue of this Part, copyright has subsisted in a cinematograph film, a person who, after that copyright has expired, causes the film to be seen or heard, or to be seen and heard, in public does not, by so doing, infringe any copyright subsisting by virtue of Part III in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.

             (3)  Where the sounds that are embodied in a sound-track associated with the visual images forming part of a cinematograph film are also embodied in a record, other than such a sound-track or a record derived directly or indirectly from such a sound-track, the copyright in the cinematograph film is not infringed by any use made of that record.

##### <a id="110AA"></a>110AA  Copying cinematograph film in different format for private use

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  the owner of videotape embodying a cinematograph film in analog form makes a copy (the **_main copy_**) of the film in electronic form for his or her private and domestic use instead of the videotape; and

                     (b)  the videotape itself is not an infringing copy of the film or of a broadcast, sound recording, work or published edition of a work; and

                     (c)  at the time the owner makes the main copy, he or she has not made, and is not making, another copy that embodies the film in an electronic form substantially identical to the electronic form in which the film is embodied in the main copy.

For this purpose, disregard a temporary copy of the film incidentally made as a necessary part of the technical process of making the main copy.

             (2)  The making of the main copy is not an infringement of copyright in the cinematograph film or in a work or other subject-matter included in the film.

Dealing with main copy may make it an infringing copy

             (3)  Subsection (2) is taken never to have applied if the main copy is:

                     (b)  let for hire; or

                     (c)  by way of trade offered or exposed for sale or hire; or

                     (d)  distributed for the purpose of trade or otherwise.

Note:          If the main copy is dealt with as described in subsection (3), then copyright may be infringed not only by the making of the main copy but also by the dealing with the main copy.

             (4)  To avoid doubt, paragraph (3)(d) does not apply to a loan of the main copy by the lender to a member of the lender’s family or household for the member’s private and domestic use.

Disposal of videotape may make the main copy an infringing copy

             (5)  Subsection (2) is taken never to have applied if the owner of the videotape disposes of it to another person.

Status of temporary copy

             (6)  If subsection (2) applies to the making of the main copy only as a result of disregarding the incidental making of a temporary copy of the film as a necessary part of the technical process of making the main copy, then:

                     (a)  if the temporary copy is destroyed at the first practicable time during or after the making of the main copy—the making of the temporary copy does not infringe copyright in the film or in any work or other subject-matter included in the film; or

                     (b)  if the temporary copy is not destroyed at that time—the making of the temporary copy is taken always to have infringed copyright (if any) subsisting in the film and in any work or other subject-matter included in the film.

Work or other subject-matter included in recording or film

             (7)  If under this section, copyright in the sound recording or cinematograph film is not infringed by the making of a copy of the recording or film, the making of that copy does not infringe copyright in any work or other subject-matter included in the recording or film.

                     (a)  in the case of a written order, the order contains a statement, signed by the customer; or

                     (b)  in the case of a telephone order, the customer makes a verifiable statement;

             (6)  Where:

                     (a)  a book is imported into Australia for a purpose mentioned in paragraph 102(1)(a), (b) or (c); and

                     (b)  the importation does not, under this section, constitute an infringement of copyright in a published edition of a work;

the use of the book for any such purpose does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the edition and subsection 103(1) does not apply to the book.

             (7)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the importation of a copy of a hardback version of a non-infringing book into Australia if the copyright owner, or his or her licensee or agent, is able to supply in Australia enough copies of a paperback version of the book to fill any reasonable order.

Works in published editions

             (4)  If, under this section, copyright in the published edition is not infringed by the making of a facsimile copy of the edition, the making of that copy does not infringe copyright in any of the works in the published edition.

             (2)  If the first owner does the act, then the first owner must hold the other owner’s share of any amount received in respect of it on trust for 4 years after the day on which the agreement is entered into (unless the amount is distributed to, or on behalf of, the other owner before then).

             (3)  If during the 4 year period, the other owner is identified and located, the first owner must distribute the amount held on trust to, or on behalf of, the other owner.

### Division 2—Actions by owner of copyright

##### <a id="115"></a>115  Actions for infringement

             (1)  Subject to this Act, the owner of a copyright may bring an action for an infringement of the copyright.

             (2)  Subject to this Act, the relief that a court may grant in an action for an infringement of copyright includes an injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the court thinks fit) and either damages or an account of profits.

             (3)  Where, in an action for infringement of copyright, it is established that an infringement was committed but it is also established that, at the time of the infringement, the defendant was not aware, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting, that the act constituting the infringement was an infringement of the copyright, the plaintiff is not entitled under this section to any damages against the defendant in respect of the infringement, but is entitled to an account of profits in respect of the infringement whether any other relief is granted under this section or not.

             (4)  Where, in an action under this section:

                     (a)  an infringement of copyright is established; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied that it is proper to do so, having regard to:

                              (i)  the flagrancy of the infringement; and

                            (ia)  the need to deter similar infringements of copyright; and

                            (ib)  the conduct of the defendant after the act constituting the infringement or, if relevant, after the defendant was informed that the defendant had allegedly infringed the plaintiff’s copyright; and

                             (ii)  whether the infringement involved the conversion of a work or other subject-matter from hardcopy or analog form into a digital or other electronic machine-readable form; and

                            (iii)  any benefit shown to have accrued to the defendant by reason of the infringement; and

                            (iv)  all other relevant matters;

the court may, in assessing damages for the infringement, award such additional damages as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.

Consideration for relief for electronic commercial infringement

             (5)  Subsection (6) applies to a court hearing an action for infringement of copyright if the court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the infringement (the **_proved infringement_**) occurred (whether as a result of the doing of an act comprised in the copyright, the authorising of the doing of such an act or the doing of another act); and

                     (b)  the proved infringement involved a communication of a work or other subject-matter to the public; and

                     (c)  because the work or other subject-matter was communicated to the public, it is likely that there were other infringements (the **_likely infringements_**) of the copyright by the defendant that the plaintiff did not prove in the action; and

                     (d)  taken together, the proved infringement and likely infringements were on a commercial scale.

             (6)  The court may have regard to the likelihood of the likely infringements (as well as the proved infringement) in deciding what relief to grant in the action.

             (7)  In determining for the purposes of paragraph (5)(d) whether, taken together, the proved infringement and the likely infringements were on a commercial scale, the following matters are to be taken into account:

                     (a)  the volume and value of any articles that:

                              (i)  are infringing copies that constitute the proved infringement; or

                             (ii)  assuming the likely infringements actually occurred, would be infringing copies constituting those infringements;

                     (b)  any other relevant matter.

             (8)  In subsection (7):

                    <a name="articl"></a>**_article_** includes a reproduction or copy of a work or other subject-matter, being a reproduction or copy in electronic form.

##### <a id="116"></a>116  Rights of owner of copyright in respect of infringing copies

             (1)  The owner of the copyright in a work or other subject-matter may bring an action for conversion or detention in relation to:

                     (a)  an infringing copy; or

                     (b)  a device (including a circumvention device) used or intended to be used for making infringing copies.

          (1A)  In an action for conversion or detention, a court may grant to the owner of the copyright all or any of the remedies that are available in such an action as if:

                     (a)  the owner of the copyright had been the owner of the infringing copy since the time the copy was made; or

                     (b)  the owner of the copyright had been the owner of the device since the time when it was used or intended to be used for making infringing copies.

          (1B)  Any relief granted by a court in an action for conversion or detention is in addition to any relief that the court may grant under section 115.

          (1C)  A court is not to grant any relief to the owner of the copyright in an action for conversion or detention if the relief that the court has granted or proposes to grant under section 115 is, in the opinion of the court, a sufficient remedy.

          (1D)  In deciding whether to grant relief in an action for conversion or detention and in assessing the amount of damages payable, the court may have regard to the following:

                     (a)  the expenses incurred by the defendant, being a person who marketed or otherwise dealt with the infringing copy, in manufacturing or acquiring the infringing copy;

                     (b)  whether the expenses were incurred before or after the infringing copy was sold or otherwise disposed of by the defendant;

                     (c)  any other matter that the court considers relevant.

           (1E)  If the infringing copy is an article of which only part consists of material that infringes copyright, the court, in deciding whether to grant relief and in assessing the amount of damages payable, may also have regard to the following:

                     (a)  the importance to the market value of the article of the material that infringes the copyright;

                     (b)  the proportion the material that infringes copyright bears to the article;

                     (c)  the extent to which the material that infringes copyright may be separated from the article.

             (2)  A plaintiff is not entitled by virtue of this section to any damages or to any other pecuniary remedy, other than costs, if it is established that, at the time of the conversion or detention:

                     (a)  the defendant was not aware, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting, that copyright subsisted in the work or other subject-matter to which the action relates;

                     (b)  where the articles converted or detained were infringing copies—the defendant believed, and had reasonable grounds for believing, that they were not infringing copies; or

                     (c)  where an article converted or detained was a device used or intended to be used for making articles—the defendant believed, and had reasonable grounds for believing, that the articles so made or intended to be made were not or would not be, as the case may be, infringing copies.

##### <a id="116AAA"></a>116AAA  Compensation for acquisition of property

             (1)  This section applies if, apart from this section, subsections 22(3A) and 97(2) and (2A) would result in the acquisition of property from a maker of a sound recording of a live performance by a performer in the performance otherwise than on just terms.

             (2)  There is payable to the maker by the performer such amount of compensation as is agreed on between those persons, or, failing agreement, as is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (3)  Any damages or compensation recovered or other remedy given in a proceeding that is commenced otherwise than under this section is to be taken into account in assessing compensation payable in a proceeding that is commenced under this section and that arises out of the same event or transaction.

             (4)  Any compensation payable in a proceeding that is commenced under this section is to be taken into account in assessing any damages or compensation or other remedy to be awarded in a proceeding that is commenced otherwise than under this section and that arises out of the same event or transaction.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="acquisit-properti"></a>**_acquisition of property_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

                    <a name="just-term"></a>**_just terms_** has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.

                    <a name="maker"></a>**_maker_** of a sound recording of a live performance means a person mentioned in paragraph 22(3A)(a).

then, on and after that day:

                     (c)  the notice ceases to have effect as such a notice in relation to the relevant copyright owners in the class or classes of copyright owners for whom a collecting society is declared, but is taken, for the purposes of this Part, to be a remuneration notice that:

                   The owner of the copyright in a free-to-air broadcast is not taken, for the purpose of this Act, to have authorised the infringement of copyright in any work, sound recording or cinematograph film included in the broadcast merely because the owner licences the retransmission of the broadcast.

           (21)  Where the Tribunal is of the opinion that:

                     (a)  an amount, or part of an amount, earned during any period by a person other than a broadcaster would, if the broadcaster and that person were the same person, form part of the gross earnings of the broadcaster in respect of that period for the purposes of this section; and

                     (b)  a relationship exists between the broadcaster and the other person (whether by reason of any shareholding or of any agreement or arrangement, or for any other reason) of such a kind that the amount or the part of the amount, as the case may be, should, for the purposes of this section, be treated as part of the gross earnings of the broadcaster in respect of that period;

             (4)  The Tribunal shall consider a scheme referred under this section and, after giving to the parties to the reference an opportunity of presenting their cases, shall make such order, confirming or varying the scheme or substituting for the scheme another scheme proposed by one of the parties, as the Tribunal considers reasonable in the circumstances.

             (5)  An order (other than an interim order) of the Tribunal under this section may, notwithstanding anything contained in the licence scheme to which it relates, be made so as to be in force either indefinitely or for such period as the Tribunal thinks fit.

This subsection has effect despite anything in the scheme referred to the Tribunal.

Note:          Depending on the Tribunal’s order, the scheme reflecting the order will be the scheme confirmed by the order, the scheme as varied by the order or the scheme substituted by the order for the scheme referred to the Tribunal.

             (4)  The Tribunal shall not begin to consider a reference under this section by an organization unless the Tribunal is satisfied that the organization is reasonably representative of the class of persons that it claims to represent.

             (5)  The Tribunal must consider the matter in dispute, give the parties an opportunity of presenting their cases then make an order that the Tribunal considers reasonable in the circumstances doing one of the following to the scheme so far as it relates to the relevant class:

             (2)  A person who claims, in a case to which a licence scheme applies, that he or she requires a licence but that the grant of a licence in accordance with the scheme would, in that case, be subject to the payment of charges, or to conditions, that are not reasonable in the circumstances of the case may apply to the Tribunal under this section.

             (1)  Where a licence scheme is in operation by virtue of this Part pending the making of an order on a reference under this Part and a person, in a case to which the scheme applies, does anything that, apart from this subsection, would be an infringement of a copyright but would not be such an infringement if the person were the holder of a licence granted in accordance with the scheme in so far as the scheme relates to cases to which the reference relates, that person shall, if he or she has complied with the relevant requirements, be in the like position, in any proceedings for infringement of that copyright, as if he or she had at the material time been the holder of such a licence.

             (2)  For the purposes of the last preceding subsection, the relevant requirements are:

                     (a)  that, at all material times, the person concerned has complied with the conditions that, in accordance with the licence scheme, would be applicable to a licence in respect of the case concerned; and

                     (b)  where, in accordance with the scheme, any charges are payable in respect of such a licence—that, at the material time, the person concerned had paid those charges to the licensor operating the scheme, or, if at that time the amount payable could not be ascertained, he or she had given an undertaking in writing to the licensor to pay the charges when ascertained.

             (3)  A person who does anything in relation to which subsection (1) applies is liable to pay to the licensor operating the licence scheme concerned the amount of any charges that would be payable if he or she were the holder of a licence granted in accordance with the scheme in so far as the scheme relates to the doing of that thing and the licensor may recover that amount in a court of competent jurisdiction from the person as a debt due to the licensor.

##### <a id="159"></a>159  Effect of order of Tribunal in relation to licences

Order under section 154\. 155 or 156

             (1)  Where an order made on a reference under this Part with respect to a licence scheme is for the time being in force and a person, in a case to which the scheme reflecting the order applies, does anything that, apart from this subsection, would be an infringement of copyright but would not be such an infringement if he or she were the holder of a licence granted in accordance with that scheme, in so far as the scheme relates to cases to which the order applies, that person shall, if he or she has complied with the relevant requirements, be in the like position, in any proceedings for infringement of that copyright, as if he or she had at the material time been the holder of such a licence.

             (2)  For the purposes of the last preceding subsection, the relevant requirements are:

                     (a)  that, at all material times, the person concerned has complied with the conditions that, in accordance with the scheme reflecting the order, would be applicable to a licence in respect of the case concerned; and

                     (b)  where, in accordance with the scheme, any charges are payable in respect of such a licence—that, at the material time, the person concerned had paid those charges to the licensor operating the scheme, or, if at that time the amount payable could not be ascertained, he or she had given an undertaking in writing to the licensor to pay the charges when ascertained.

             (3)  A person who does anything in relation to which subsection (1) applies is liable to pay to the licensor operating the scheme concerned the amount of any charges that would be payable if he or she were the holder of a licence granted in accordance with the scheme reflecting the order, in so far as the scheme relates to the doing of that thing, and the licensor may recover that amount in a court of competent jurisdiction from the person as a debt due to the licensor.

Order under section 157 specifying conditions and charges

             (4)  Where the Tribunal has made an order on an application under subsection 157(1), (2) or (3) specifying charges, if any, and conditions, in relation to the applicant, in respect of the matters specified in the order, then if:

                     (a)  the applicant has complied with the conditions specified in the order; and

                     (b)  in a case where the order specifies any charges—he or she has paid those charges to the licensor or, if the amount payable could not be ascertained, has given to the licensor an undertaking in writing to pay the charges when ascertained;

the applicant shall be in the like position, in any proceedings for infringement of copyright relating to any of those matters, as if he or she had at all material times been the holder of a licence granted by the owner of the copyright concerned on the conditions, and subject to payment of the charges (if any), specified in the order.

             (5)  Where the Tribunal has made an order on an application under subsection 157(4) specifying charges (if any) and conditions, in relation to the persons, or to persons included in the classes of persons, specified in the order, in respect of matters specified in the order, then, if:

                     (a)  any such person has complied with the conditions specified in the order; and

                     (b)  in the case where the order specifies any charges—the person has paid those charges to the licensor or, if the amount payable could not be ascertained, has given to the licensor an undertaking in writing to pay the charges when ascertained;

that person shall be in the like position, in any proceedings for infringement of copyright relating to any of those matters, as if he or she had at all material times been the holder of a licence granted by the owner of the copyright concerned on the conditions, and subject to payment of the charges (if any), specified in the order.

             (6)  Where a person in relation to whom an order referred to in subsection (4) or subsection (5) applies does, in relation to any of the matters specified in that order, anything that, apart from that subsection, would be an infringement of copyright but would not be such an infringement if he or she were the holder of a licence in respect of the doing of that thing granted by the owner of the copyright concerned on the conditions and subject to payment of the charges (if any) specified in the order, that person is liable to pay to the owner of the copyright the amount of any charges that would be payable if he or she were the holder of such a licence and the owner of the copyright may recover that amount in a court of competent jurisdiction from the person as a debt due to the owner of the copyright.

             (7)  To avoid doubt, subsections (4) and (5) do not apply to an order that a person be granted a licence.

Order under section 157 that person be granted licence

             (8)  A person whom the Tribunal has ordered under section 157 be granted a licence in the terms proposed by the applicant, the licensor concerned or another party to the application under that section:

                     (b)  is liable to pay the owner of the copyright concerned the amount of any charges that would be payable if the person had been granted the licence in those terms.

Note:          Paragraph (a)—if those terms made the licence subject to conditions and the person did not comply with the conditions, the licence will not give the person a defence in the proceedings.

             (9)  The owner of the copyright may recover the amount described in paragraph (8)(b) from the person in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due to the owner.

Acts of false attribution for live performances

             (1)  For a live performance, it is an act of false attribution for the stager of the performance, or a person authorised by the stager, to state falsely, or imply falsely, to the audience or intended audience immediately before the performance that:

                     (b)  the performance is being, or will be, presented by a particular group of performers.

Note:          For the definition of **_staged_**, see section 191A.

Example 1:     The stager of a live performance given by X and Y attributes the performance to A and B. This is an act of false attribution in relation to both X and Y.

Example 2:     The stager of a live performance given by X and Y attributes the performance to X and A. This is an act of false attribution in relation to both X and Y (even though X is mentioned in the attribution).

             (2)  For a live performance, it is an act of false attribution for the stager of the performance, or a person authorised by the stager, to state falsely, or imply falsely, to the audience during the performance that:

                     (a)  a person is, was, or will be a performer in the performance; or

                     (b)  the performance is being, was, or will be, presented by a particular group of performers.

             (3)  For a live performance, it is an act of false attribution for the stager of the performance, or a person authorised by the stager, to state falsely, or imply falsely, to the audience immediately after the performance that:

                     (a)  a person was a performer in the performance; or

                     (b)  a particular group of performers presented the performance.

             (4)  However, doing an act mentioned in subsection (1), (2) or (3) is only an act of false attribution if the performance is in public or is communicated to the public. For this purpose, any unauthorised communication to the public is to be disregarded.

Acts of false attribution for recorded performances—individual performers

             (5)  For a recorded performance, each of the following acts is an act of false attribution:

                     (a)  to insert or affix, or authorise the inserting or affixing of, a person’s name in or on a record embodying the performance in such a way as to imply falsely that the person is a performer in the performance;

                     (b)  to deal with a record embodying the performance if:

                              (i)  a person’s name has been inserted or affixed in or on the record as mentioned in paragraph (a); and

                             (ii)  the attributor knows that the person is not a performer in the performance;

                     (c)  to communicate the recorded performance to the public as being a performance in which a person is a performer, if the attributor knows that the person is not a performer in the performance.

Acts of false attribution for recorded performances—groups of performers

             (6)  For a recorded performance, each of the following acts is an act of false attribution:

                     (a)  to insert or affix, or authorise the inserting or affixing of, a group name in or on a record embodying the performance in such a way as to imply falsely that the group are performers in the performance;

                     (b)  to deal with a record embodying the performance if:

                              (i)  a group name has been inserted or affixed in or on the record as mentioned in paragraph (a); and

                             (ii)  the attributor knows that the group are not performers in the performance;

                     (c)  to communicate the recorded performance to the public as being a performance in which a group are performers, if the attributor knows that the group are not performers in the performance.

Silent performers

             (7)  It is not an act of false attribution of performership to state that a performer who participated silently in a performance performed in the performance.

Example:    X and Y together present a cabaret act in which X sings and Y dances silently. The “performance” for the purposes of this Part consists only of the sounds made by X. It is not an act of false attribution in respect of the performance to state or imply that Y was also a performer.

##### <a id="195AHC"></a>195AHC  Act of false attribution of performership of altered recorded performance

             (1)  If the work is a recorded performance that has been altered by a person other than a performer in the performance, it is an act of false attribution of performership in relation to the performer to deal with a copy of the recorded performance as so altered, as being a copy of the unaltered recorded performance, if, to the knowledge of the attributor, the copy of the recorded performance is not a copy of the unaltered recorded performance.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the effect of the alteration is insubstantial; or

                     (b)  the alteration was required by law to be made, or was otherwise necessary to avoid a breach of any law.

##### <a id="195AZN"></a>195AZN  Application—right not to have authorship falsely attributed

             (1)  The right not to have authorship falsely attributed subsists in respect of a work made before or after the commencement of this Part but this Part only applies in relation to acts of false attribution done after that commencement.

             (2)  Paragraph 195AD(b) or (c), 195AE(2)(b) or (c) or 195AF(2)(b) applies to an act of false attribution done after the commencement of this Part even if the name concerned was inserted or affixed before that commencement.

Note:          Subsection 22(1) explains when a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is taken to be made and paragraph 22(4)(a) explains when a cinematograph film is taken to be made.

##### <a id="195AZO"></a>195AZO  Application—right of integrity of authorship

             (1)  The right of integrity of authorship in respect of:

                     (a)  a cinematograph film; or

                     (b)  a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work as included in a cinematograph film;

subsists only if the cinematograph film is made after the commencement of this Part.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the right of integrity of authorship in respect of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, other than such a work as included in a cinematograph film, subsists in respect of a work made before or after the commencement of this Part.

#### Subdivision B—Miscellaneous provisions about moral rights of performers

##### <a id="195AZP"></a>195AZP  Parts of performances

                   Moral rights in respect of a live performance or recorded performance apply in relation to the whole or a substantial part of the performance.

##### <a id="195AZQ"></a>195AZQ  Performances that have more than one performer

             (1)  This section applies to a live performance or recorded performance that has more than one performer.

             (2)  A performer’s right of attribution of performership in respect of the performance is a right of the performer to be identified as a performer.

Example:    If X and Y are the performers in a performance, then each of them has the right to be identified. However, there is no infringement of X’s moral right if Y is not identified (and vice versa).

Note:          See also subsection 195ABC(3), which relates to the use of group names.

             (3)  An act of false attribution of performership in respect of the performance infringes each performer’s right not to have performership falsely attributed.

Example:    X and Y are the performers in a performance that is falsely attributed to X and Z. This false attribution infringes X’s moral right and Y’s moral right.

             (4)  The right of integrity of performership in respect of the performance is a right of each performer.

Example:    X and Y are the performers in a performance. The performance is subjected to derogatory treatment that is prejudicial to X’s reputation but not to Y’s reputation. The result is an infringement of X’s right of integrity of performership but not an infringement of Y’s right of integrity of performership.

             (5)  The consent of one performer to any act or omission affecting his or her moral rights in respect of the performance does not affect the moral rights of any other performer in respect of the performance.

##### <a id="195AZR"></a>195AZR  Application

             (1)  Moral rights in respect of a live performance only subsist in a live performance that occurs after the commencement of this section.

             (2)  Moral rights in respect of a recorded performance only subsist if the live performance concerned occurs after the commencement of this section.

             (1)  A person who uses a registered trade mark in relation to imported goods that are similar to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered does not infringe the trade mark if:

             (1)  Where the inclusion in a television broadcast or sound broadcast of a reading or recitation of an extract from a published literary or dramatic work, or from an adaptation of such a work, does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the work, a person who, by the reception of the broadcast, causes the work or adaptation to be performed in public does not, by doing so, infringe the copyright in the work.

                     (a)  the circumstances of the use (including those described in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d)) amount to a special case;

                     (b)  the use is covered by subsection (2), (3) or (4);

                     (c)  the use does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject-matter;

                     (d)  the use does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the copyright.

Use by body administering library or archives

             (2)  This subsection covers a use that:

                     (a)  is made by or on behalf of the body administering a library or archives; and

                             (ii)  someone else;

                     (b)  the use is made for the purpose of the person obtaining a reproduction or copy of the work or other subject-matter in another form, or with a feature, that reduces the difficulty;

                     (c)  the use is not made partly for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage or profit.

This section does not apply if under another provision the use does not, or might not, infringe copyright

             (6)  Subsection (1) does not apply if, because of another provision of this Act:

Example 1: Paragraph (a)—Without using an appliance adapted for producing multiple copies or an appliance that can produce copies by reprographic reproduction, a school teacher reproduces a literary work in the course of educational instruction. Under subsection 200(1), the reproduction is not an infringement of copyright in the work, so this section does not apply.

Example 2: Paragraph (b)—A body administering an institution assisting persons with a print disability makes a Braille version of a published literary work. Under subsection 135ZP(2), making such a version does not infringe copyright in the work if certain conditions (relating to remuneration etc.) are met, so this section does not apply.

Cost recovery not commercial advantage or profit

          (6A)  The use does not fail to meet the condition in paragraph (2)(c), (3)(c) or (4)(c) merely because of the charging of a fee that:

                     (a)  is connected with the use; and

                     (b)  does not exceed the costs of the use to the charger of the fee.

                     (b)  communicates the performance to the public, either directly from the live performance or from an unauthorised recording of it.

Note:          An educational or other institution can copy and communicate a broadcast of a performance without the authority of the performer in some circumstances: see sections 135E and 135F.

             (2)  A person makes an unauthorised use of a performance if the person, at any time during the protection period of the performance and without the authority of the performer:

                     (a)  makes a copy of a recording of the performance that the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, is an unauthorised recording;

                     (b)  makes a copy of an exempt recording of the performance, being a copy that the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, is not itself an exempt recording;

                     (c)  makes, for use in a sound-track, a copy of an authorised sound recording of the performance and the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the making of the sound recording was not authorised for the purpose of use in that or any other sound-track;

                     (d)  has in his or her possession a recording of the performance, for the purpose of:

                             (ii)  distributing it for the purpose of trade, or for any other purpose that will affect prejudicially the financial interests of the performer or performers in the performance;

                            being a recording that the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, is an unauthorised recording;

                     (e)  sells, lets on hire, or by way of trade exhibits in public or offers or exposes for sale or hire, a recording of the performance that the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, is an unauthorised recording;

                      (f)  distributes a recording of the performance for the purpose of trade, or for any other purpose to an extent that will affect prejudicially the financial interests of the performer or performers in the performance, being a recording that the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, is an unauthorised recording;
