             (1)  In determining an application for a superannuation order in respect of a person, the appropriate court may have regard to the transcript of any proceedings against the person for the offence to which the application relates and to the evidence given in any such proceedings.

             (2)  In an application for a superannuation order, any finding of fact made by a court in any proceedings for the offence to which the application relates, is _prima facie_ evidence of that fact and the finding may be proved by the production of documents, under the seal of the court, in which the finding appears.

             (3)  In an application for a superannuation order in respect of a person, a certificate signed or sealed by the person’s superannuation authority:

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Superannuation orders: making

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), where an application is made for a superannuation order in respect of a person, the court must, if satisfied that the offence to which the application relates is a corruption offence, by order, declare:

                     (a)  that the person was convicted of a corruption offence; and

                     (b)  that this Part applies in relation to the rights of, and benefits paid or payable to or in respect of, the person under any superannuation scheme.

             (2)  Where a person is, because of paragraph 6(1)(b), to be taken to have been convicted of an offence, a court must not make a superannuation order in relation to the person unless the court is also satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the person has absconded and:

                     (a)  the person has been committed for trial for the offence; or

                     (b)  the court is satisfied, having regard to all the evidence before it, that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could lawfully find the person guilty of the offence.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  employer contributions or benefits made or payable by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority in respect of the person under any superannuation scheme have been paid into, and are held in, a fund under the scheme; and

                     (b)  the person would, but for subsection 21(1), become entitled, subject to and in accordance with the scheme, to the benefit, or to a benefit attributable to the employer contributions, as the case may be;

the court must:

                     (c)  work out, and specify in the superannuation order, the amount that it thinks reflects the value of the sum of those contributions or benefits as at the day on which the order is made, plus the interest on those contributions or benefits accrued under the scheme before that day; and

                     (d)  include in the superannuation order an order that the amount so specified be paid to the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority, whichever the court considers appropriate.

             (4)  Where any benefits have been paid to the person under any superannuation scheme (whether before, on or after the commencing day), the court must:

                     (a)  specify in the superannuation order the amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2008C00652/Html/CrimesSuperBen89WD02_image003.gif)

where:

                    <a name="ab"></a>**_AB_**_(amount of benefits)_ is the amount that the court thinks reflects the value of the sum of the benefits paid by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority to the person under the scheme as at the day on which the order is made. 

                    <a name="ec"></a>**_EC_**_(employee contributions)_ is the amount that the court thinks is equal to the part of **AB** that is attributable to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person as at that day plus the interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme before that day; and

                     (b)  include in the superannuation order an order that the person pay the amount so specified to the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority, whichever the court considers appropriate.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the value of an amount of employer contributions or benefits, and of accrued interest, is their value worked out having regard to any decline in the purchasing power of money between the day on which the contributions or benefits were made or paid, or the interest accrued, as the case may be, and the day as at which their value must be worked out.

             (6)  The DPP must give written notice of a superannuation order to the person’s superannuation authority.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  When does a superannuation order take effect?

             (2)  A superannuation order made in relation to a person, other than a person who has absconded, does not take effect until:

                     (a)  the end of the period (if any) allowed for appealing against the conviction or sentence under the relevant Commonwealth, State or Territory law; or

                     (b)  if the person appeals against his or her conviction or sentence, or both—the appeal, and any proceedings resulting from it, are finally determined, withdrawn or otherwise disposed of.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Effect of superannuation orders

             (1)  Where a court makes a superannuation order in respect of a person:

                     (a)  all rights of, and benefits payable to or in respect of, the person or a dependant of the person (being rights or benefits arising out of the person’s membership of any superannuation scheme) cease, or cease to be payable, on the day on which the order takes effect, and the person ceases to be a member of the scheme on that day; and

                     (b)  any amount of the kind mentioned in subsection 19(3) that is vested in the person ceases to be so vested on that day; and

                     (c)  the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority is not liable to pay any employer contribution or benefit under the scheme in respect of the person on or after that day.

             (2)  An amount payable by a person to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under a superannuation order is a debt due by the person to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth authority, as the case may be.

             (3)  An order under subsection 19(3) or (4) against a person may be enforced as if it were an order made in civil proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth or the relevant Commonwealth authority against the person to recover a debt due by the person to the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth authority, and the debt arising from the order is to be taken to be a judgment debt.

             (4)  Despite the Superannuation Act, or any other Act or any agreement, where subsection (1) applies to a person who is an employee when the superannuation order takes effect, the person is entitled, on the day on which he or she ceases to be a member of the relevant superannuation scheme, to payment of an amount equal to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person (being contributions that are held in a fund under the scheme) plus the amount of interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme.

             (5)  Despite the Superannuation Act, or any other Act or any agreement, where subsection (1) applies to a person who:

                     (a)  was an employee when the relevant corruption offence was committed but ceases to be an employee before the superannuation order takes effect; and

                     (b)  would, but for that subsection, have been entitled to payment of benefits under the relevant superannuation scheme on or after the day on which the superannuation order takes effect;

the person is entitled, on the day on which he or she ceases to be a member of the scheme, to payment of an amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2008C00652/Html/CrimesSuperBen89WD02_image004.gif)

where:

                    <a name="ac"></a>**_AC_**_(amount of contributions)_ is an amount equal to the sum of the employee contributions paid under the scheme by the person plus the amount of interest on those contributions accrued under the scheme.

                    <a name="ar"></a>**_AR_**_(amount received)_ is an amount equal to that part of the sum of all amounts paid by way of benefit before the day on which the superannuation order takes effect that is attributable to **AC**.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Superannuation orders: variation

             (1)  If a superannuation order made in respect of a person:

                     (a)  specifies an amount under subsection 19(3) or (4); and

                     (b)  takes effect on a day that is later than the day on which the order is made;

the DPP may, as soon as practicable after the order takes effect, apply to the court that made the order to vary the order by substituting for the specified amount an increased amount, having regard to any amount of employer contributions or benefits paid by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority in respect of the person during the prescribed period.

             (2)  Where the DPP makes an application, the court must vary the superannuation order accordingly and, for the purposes of working out the increased amount to be specified in the superannuation order, as varied, subsections 19(3), (4) and (5) apply as if references in subsections 19(3) and (4) to the day on which the order is made were references to the day on which the variation is made.

             (3)  In this section:

                    <a name="prescrib-period"></a>**_prescribed period_** means the period starting on the day on which the superannuation order is made and ending on the day on which the variation is made.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Superannuation orders: revocation

             (1)  A superannuation order made in relation to a person is to be taken to have been revoked if:

                     (a)  the person’s conviction is quashed; or

                     (b)  the person’s sentence is so reduced or otherwise changed that it would no longer support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 17(1A); or

                     (c)  where the person is taken to be convicted because of paragraph 6(1)(b)—the person is brought before a court in respect of the offence concerned and, having been convicted of that offence, does not receive a sentence that would support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 17(1A).

             (2)  Where a superannuation order is taken to have been revoked, the DPP must give written notice of the fact to:

                     (a)  the person in respect of whom the order was made; and

                     (b)  the person’s superannuation authority.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  a superannuation order is made in relation to a person who is taken to be convicted because of paragraph 6(1)(b); and

                     (b)  the superannuation order is to be taken to have been revoked;

there is payable to the person an amount determined by the Minister for Finance, being an amount that the Minister considers to be a fair recompense to the person, having regard to:

                     (c)  any amount paid to the person under subsection 21(4) or (5); and

                     (d)  any amount recovered from the person under a recovery order against the person; and

                     (e)  any other financial loss sustained by the person as a result of the superannuation order; and

                      (f)  any other matters that the Minister thinks are relevant in the circumstances of the case.

## Part 3—Restraining orders

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Application for restraining order

             (1)  Where a person (in this Part called **_the defendant_**):

                     (a)  has been convicted of an offence; or

                     (b)  has been, or is about to be, charged with an offence;

the DPP may apply to the appropriate court for a restraining order against specified property of the defendant or of another person, or both.

             (2)  For the purposes of an application, the DPP may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, give the court such undertakings with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, as the court requires.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Making of restraining orders

             (1)  Subject to this Part, where an application is made for a restraining order against property and the appropriate court is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the offence concerned is, or may be, a corruption offence; and

                     (b)  if the defendant has been sentenced in respect of the offence—the sentence would support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 17(1A); and

                     (c)  the defendant is, or has been, a member of a superannuation scheme;

the court may, by order, direct that the property, or such part of the property as is specified in the order, is not to be disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, by any person except in the manner and circumstances (if any) specified in the order.

             (2)  A restraining order must not be made against a person’s property to any extent greater than is necessary to ensure the recovery of any amount payable, or reasonably likely to be payable, by the defendant under a recovery order.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not prevent the court from making a restraining order against a person’s property, being property whose value is more than the amount payable, or reasonably likely to be payable, by the defendant under a recovery order if there is no other property of sufficient value in respect of which the court can make a restraining order.

             (4)  A court may make a restraining order against property whether or not there is any risk of the property being disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, in a manner that would defeat the operation of this Act.

             (5)  Where the application is made in reliance on the proposed charging of the defendant with the offence concerned, the court must not make a restraining order unless satisfied that the defendant will be charged with the offence, or with a related corruption offence, within 48 hours.

             (6)  A court may refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses or fails to give the court such undertakings as the court considers appropriate with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to the making and operation of the order.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Restraining order may be subject to conditions

             (1)  A restraining order against a person’s property may be made subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit, for example, conditions providing for meeting, out of the property or a specified part of the property, all or any of the following:

                     (a)  the person’s reasonable living expenses (including the reasonable living expenses of any dependants of the person) and reasonable business expenses;

                     (b)  the person’s taxed legal expenses in defending a criminal charge;

                     (c)  a specified debt incurred by the person in good faith (being a debt to which neither paragraph (a) or (b) applies).

             (2)  The court must not make provision of a kind mentioned in subsection (1) unless satisfied that the person cannot meet the expense or debt concerned out of property that is not subject to a restraining order.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Affidavit of police officer needed in certain cases

             (1)  Where an application is made for a restraining order and the defendant has not been convicted of the offence concerned, the court must not make a restraining order unless:

                     (a)  the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of a police officer stating that the officer believes the defendant committed the offence; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for so believing.

             (2)  Where an application for a restraining order is made against specified property of a person other than the defendant, the court must not make a restraining order against the property unless:

                     (a)  the application is supported by an affidavit of a police officer stating that the officer believes that the property is subject to the effective control of the defendant; and

                     (b)  the court is satisfied, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for so believing.

             (3)  An affidavit made by a police officer for the purpose of this section that states that the officer believes a particular matter must set out the grounds on which the officer holds that belief.

             (4)  The court may, at any time before the final determination of an application for:

                     (a)  a restraining order; or

                     (b)  an extension of the period of effect of a restraining order;

direct the DPP to give or publish notice of the application to a specified person or class of persons in the manner and within the time the court thinks appropriate.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Notice of application for restraining order

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the DPP must give written notice of an application for a restraining order against property to:

                     (a)  the owner of the property; and

                     (b)  any other person the DPP has reason to believe may have an interest in the property.

             (2)  Where notice of an application has not been given, the court must consider the application if the DPP asks it to do so but, subject to section 28A, a restraining order made by virtue of this subsection ceases to have effect at the end of the period (not exceeding 14 days) specified by the court in the restraining order.

##### <a id="28A"></a>28A  Extension of certain restraining orders

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the court may, on application made by the DPP before the end of the period mentioned in subsection 28(2), extend the period of effect of a restraining order made in reliance on that subsection.

             (2)  Subsections 27(1), (2) and (3) apply, with the necessary changes made, to the extension of the period of operation of a restraining order made in reliance on subsection 28(2) in the same way as they apply to the making of a restraining order.

             (3)  The DPP must give written notice of an application under subsection (1) for the extension of the period of effect of a restraining order to:

                     (a)  the owner of the property against which the restraining order was made; and

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Witnesses not required to answer questions etc. in certain cases

                   On the hearing of an application for a restraining order, a witness is not required to answer a question or to produce a document if the court is satisfied that the answering of the question or the production of the document may prejudice the investigation of, or the prosecution of a person for, an offence.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Notice of restraining orders

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Ancillary orders

             (1)  Where an appropriate court makes a restraining order, it may, at the same time or at any later time, make any ancillary orders that it thinks appropriate, for example:

                            about the affairs (including the nature and location of any property) of:

                            (iii)  anyone else who is either the owner or the defendant, or both; and

                            (iv)  if the person to be examined is either the owner or the defendant, or both—that person; and

                     (d)  an order about carrying out any undertaking with respect to the payment of damages or costs given by the Commonwealth in connection with the making of the restraining order.

             (2)  An ancillary order may be made on application by:

                     (a)  the DPP; or

                     (b)  the owner of property subject to the restraining order; or

                     (c)  with the leave of the court—any other person.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  a defendant has been convicted of, or has been charged or is about to be charged with, an offence; and

                     (b)  an appropriate court makes a restraining order against property in reliance on the conviction, charging or proposed charging; and

                     (c)  a person, other than the defendant, who has an interest in the property applies to the court for a variation of the order to exclude the person’s interest from the order;

the court must grant the application if satisfied that the applicant’s interest in the property is not subject to the effective control of the defendant.

             (4)  Where a person is examined before a court or a registrar under an order under subsection (1), the person is not excused from answering a question when required to do so by the court or registrar, as the case may be, on the ground that the answer to the question might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to forfeiture or a penalty.

             (5)  Where a person is examined before a court or registrar under an order under subsection (1), the statement or disclosure made by the person in answer to a question put in the course of the examination, and any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect result of the statement or disclosure, is not admissible against the person in any criminal proceedings except a proceeding for giving false testimony in the course of the examination.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), proceedings on an application for a superannuation order or a restraining order are not criminal proceedings.

             (7)  On the hearing of an application for an order under subsection (1), a witness is not required to answer a question or to produce a document if the court is satisfied that the answering of the question or the production of the document may prejudice the investigation of, or the prosecution of the person for, an offence.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Charge on property subject to restraining order

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a recovery order is made against a defendant; and

                     (b)  a restraining order is, or has been, made against:

                              (i)  property of the defendant; or

                             (ii)  property of another person in relation to which an order is, or has been, made under subsection 40(1);

                            in reliance on the defendant’s conviction of a particular offence or a related corruption offence or on the charging, or proposed charging, of the defendant with a particular offence or a related corruption offence;

then, upon the making of the later of the orders, there is created, by force of this section, a charge on the property to secure the payment of the amount specified in the recovery order to the Commonwealth or the relevant Commonwealth authority, as the case requires.

             (2)  A charge on property of a person ceases to have effect:

                     (a)  if the relevant recovery order ceases to have effect; or

                     (b)  upon payment to the Commonwealth, or the relevant Commonwealth authority, of the amount specified in the order; or

                     (c)  upon the person becoming a bankrupt; or

                     (d)  upon the sale or other disposition of the property by the owner of the property with the consent of the court that made the recovery order; or

                     (e)  upon the sale of the property to a purchaser in good faith for sufficient consideration who, at the time of the purchase, has no notice of the charge;

whichever first occurs.

             (3)  A charge on property:

                     (a)  is subject to every encumbrance on the property that came into existence before the charge and that would, but for this subsection, have priority over the charge; and

                     (b)  has priority over all other encumbrances; and

                     (c)  subject to subsection (2), is not affected by any change of ownership of the property.

             (4)  Where:

                     (a)  a charge is created on property of a particular kind; and

                     (b)  the provisions of any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory provide for the registration of title to, or charges over, property of that kind;

the DPP may cause the charge to be registered under the provisions of that law and, if the charge is so registered, a person who purchases, or otherwise acquires an interest in, the property after the registration is to be taken, for the purposes of paragraph (2)(e), to have notice of the charge at the time of the purchase or acquisition.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Registration of restraining orders

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a restraining order applies to property of a particular kind; and

                     (b)  the provisions of any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory provide for the registration of title to, or charges over, property of that kind;

the authority responsible for administering those provisions may, on application by the DPP, record on the register kept under those provisions particulars of the restraining order.

             (2)  Where particulars of a restraining order are recorded under subsection (1), a person who later deals with the property is to be taken, for the purposes of section 35, to have notice of the restraining order at the time of the dealing.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Contravention of restraining orders

             (1)  A person who intentionally contravenes a restraining order by disposing of, or otherwise dealing with, property that is subject to the restraining order is guilty of an offence punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 5 years.

             (2)  Where:

                     (a)  a restraining order is made against property; and

                     (b)  the property is disposed of, or otherwise dealt with, in contravention of the restraining order; and

                     (c)  the disposition or dealing was either not for sufficient consideration or not in favour of a person who acted in good faith;

the DPP may apply to the court that made the restraining order for an order that the disposition or dealing be set aside.

             (3)  Where the DPP makes an application under subsection (2) in relation to a disposition or dealing, the court may make an order:

                     (a)  setting the disposition or dealing aside as from the day on which it took place; or

                     (b)  setting the disposition or dealing aside as from the day of the order under this subsection and declaring the respective rights of any persons who acquired interests in the property on or after the day on which the disposition or dealing took place and before the day of the order under this subsection.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Restraining orders: revocation

                   Where a court has made a restraining order against a person’s property, the court may, on application made by the person, revoke the order if:

                     (a)  where the order was made in reliance on the person’s conviction of an offence or the charging, or proposed charging, of the person with an offence—the person gives security satisfactory to the court for the payment of any amount that may be specified in a recovery order against the person; or

                     (b)  the person gives undertakings satisfactory to the court concerning the person’s property.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  When do restraining orders cease to have effect?

             (1)  A restraining order ceases to have effect if any of the following things happen:

                     (a)  the defendant is acquitted of the offence, or the charge is withdrawn or otherwise disposed of without conviction and the defendant has not been charged with a related corruption offence before the acquittal, withdrawal or disposal;

                     (b)  the defendant is convicted of the offence, but does not receive a sentence that would support the making of an application for a superannuation order under subsection 17(1A);

                     (c)  the Minister refuses to authorise the DPP to apply for a superannuation order in respect of the defendant;

                     (d)  the appropriate court refuses to make a recovery order against the defendant;

                     (e)  such an order is made in respect of the defendant but is later satisfied or is taken to have been revoked;

                      (f)  where the restraining order was made in reliance on the proposed charging of the person with an offence—the defendant is not charged with the offence or a related corruption offence before the end of the period of 48 hours after the order is made.

             (2)  Subject to this section, a restraining order ceases to have effect, if it has not already done so under subsection (1), at the end of the relevant period in relation to the order.

             (3)  If, within the relevant period in relation to a restraining order, an application is made under section 38 for an extension of the period of effect of the restraining order and the court refuses the application after the end of the relevant period, the restraining order ceases to have effect when the court refuses the application.

             (4)  If, within the relevant period in relation to a restraining order, an application is made under section 38 for an extension of the period of effect of the restraining order and the application is granted, the restraining order ceases to have effect at the time, or on the occurrence of the event, specified in an order made by the court under that section.

             (2)  Where, on an application for an extension of the period of effect of a restraining order, the court is satisfied:

                     (a)  that a recovery order has been, or may still be, made against the person; and

                     (b)  where the property concerned is the property of another person—an order under subsection 40(1) has been, or may still be, made;

the court may:

                     (c)  by order, extend the period of effect of the restraining order; and

                     (d)  make such other order or orders as it thinks appropriate in relation to the operation of the restraining order.

             (3)  The DPP must give a person written notice of an application in relation to a restraining order in respect of the person’s property.
