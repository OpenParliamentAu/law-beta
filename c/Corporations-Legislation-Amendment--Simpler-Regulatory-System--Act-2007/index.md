Note 1:       A person is taken not to contravene section 727 if a notice purports to comply with this subsection but does not actually comply with this subsection: see subsection 727(5).

Note 2:       A notice must not be false or misleading in a material particular, or omit anything that would render it misleading in a material respect: see sections 1308 and 1309\. The body has an obligation to correct a defective notice: see subsection (10) of this section.

             (8)  For the purposes of subsection (7), excluded information is information:

                     (a)  that has been excluded from a continuous disclosure notice in accordance with the listing rules of the relevant market operator to whom that notice is required to be given; and

                     (b)  that investors and their professional advisers would reasonably require for the purpose of making an informed assessment of:

Obligation to correct defective notice

                     (a)  the notice given under subsection (2) is defective; and

                     (c)  the body does not, within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the defect, give the relevant market operator a notice that sets out the information necessary to correct the defect.

           (11)  For the purposes of subsection (10), the notice under subsection (2) is **_defective_** if the notice:

                     (a)  does not comply with paragraph (2)(f); or

                     (b)  is false or misleading in a material particular; or

                     (c)  has omitted from it a matter or thing, the omission of which renders the notice misleading in a material respect.

             (3)  ASIC may make a determination under this subsection if ASIC is satisfied that in the previous 12 months the issuer of the relevant product contravened any of the following provisions:

                     (a)  the provisions of Chapter 2M as they apply to the registered scheme in which the relevant product is an interest;

                     (b)  section 674 or 675 as it applies to the registered scheme in which the relevant product is an interest;

                     (c)  section 1016E, 1021D, 1021E or 1021J;

                     (d)  subsection (10) of this section;

                     (e)  section 1308 as it applies to a notice under subsection (2) of this section.

             (4)  The determination must be made in writing and a copy must be published in the _Gazette_ as soon as practicable after the determination is made.

             (5)  The determination made under subsection (3) is not a legislative instrument.

             (6)  A failure to publish a copy of the determination does not affect the validity of the determination.

Requirements for notice

             (7)  A notice complies with this subsection if the notice:

                     (a)  states that the relevant product was issued without a Product Disclosure Statement for the relevant product being prepared; and

                     (b)  states that the notice is being given under paragraph (2)(f); and

                     (c)  states that, as a disclosing entity, the issuer of the relevant product is subject to regular reporting and disclosure obligations; and

                     (d)  states that, as at the date of the notice, the issuer of the relevant product has complied with:

                              (i)  the provisions of Chapter 2M as they apply to the registered scheme in which the relevant product is an interest; and

                             (ii)  section 674 as it applies to that registered scheme; and

                     (e)  sets out any information that is excluded information as at the date of the notice (see subsections (8) and (9)); and

                      (f)  states:

                              (i)  the potential effect the issue of the relevant product will have on the control of the body; and

                             (ii)  the consequences of that effect.

Note 1:       A person is taken not to contravene section 1021C if a notice purports to comply with this subsection but does not actually comply with this subsection: see subsection 1021C(5).

Note 2:       A notice must not be false or misleading in a material particular, or omit anything that would render it misleading in a material respect: see sections 1308 and 1309\. The issuer has an obligation to correct a defective notice: see subsection (10) of this section.

             (8)  For the purposes of subsection (7), excluded information is information:

                     (a)  that has been excluded from a continuous disclosure notice in accordance with the listing rules of the relevant market operator to whom that notice is required to be given; and

                     (b)  that a person would reasonably require for the purpose of making a decision, as a retail client, whether to acquire the relevant product.

             (9)  The notice given under subsection (2) must contain any excluded information only to the extent to which it is reasonable for a person considering, as a retail client, whether to acquire the relevant product to expect to find the information in a Product Disclosure Statement.

Obligation to correct defective notice

           (10)  The issuer of the relevant product contravenes this subsection if:

                     (a)  the notice given under subsection (2) is defective; and

                     (b)  the issuer becomes aware of the defect in the notice within 12 months after the relevant product is issued; and

                     (c)  the issuer does not, within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the defect, give the relevant market operator a notice that sets out the information necessary to correct the defect.

           (11)  For the purposes of subsection (10), the notice under subsection (2) is **_defective_** if the notice:

                     (a)  does not comply with paragraph (2)(f); or

                     (b)  is false or misleading in a material particular; or

                     (c)  has omitted from it a matter or thing, the omission of which renders the notice misleading in a material respect.

                             (ii)  if the regulated person is not required under subsection (1A) to give a Product Disclosure Statement—both the issuer of the relevant product, and the controller, give the relevant market operator for the issuer a written notice that complies with subsection (6) before the relevant conduct occurs.

Insert:

#### Subdivision DA—Replacement Product Disclosure Statements

##### <a id="1014G"></a>1014G  Application of this Subdivision—stapled securities

                   This Subdivision applies if:

                     (a)  a Product Disclosure Statement has been lodged in relation to an offer for the issue or sale of an interest in a managed investment scheme; and

                     (b)  the interest can only be transferred together with one or more securities; and

                     (c)  a disclosure document has been lodged in relation to an offer for the issue or sale of the security (or securities).

##### <a id="1014H"></a>1014H  What a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement is

                   A **_Replacement Product Disclosure Statement_** is a document that replaces the Product Disclosure Statement (the **_earlier PDS_**) mentioned in paragraph 1014G(a) in order to:

                     (a)  correct a misleading or deceptive statement in the earlier PDS; or

                     (b)  correct an omission from the earlier PDS of information it is required to contain; or

                     (c)  update, or add to, the information contained in the earlier PDS; or

                   If a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement is prepared in accordance with section 1014K and lodged with ASIC as provided by Subdivision E (in its application under section 1014L), a reference to a Product Disclosure Statement is taken to be a reference to the Replacement Product Disclosure Statement for the purposes of the application of this  Act to events that occur after the lodgment.

Note:          This section means, for example, that offers made after lodgment of the Replacement Product Disclosure Statement must be accompanied by copies of the Replacement Product Disclosure Statement and not the earlier PDS.

##### <a id="1014K"></a>1014K  Form, content and preparation of Replacement Product Disclosure Statements

             (1)  At the beginning of a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement, there must be:

                     (a)  a statement that it is a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement; and

                     (b)  an identification of the Product Disclosure Statement it replaces.

             (2)  The title “Replacement Product Disclosure Statement” must be used on the cover of, or at or near the front of, a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement.

             (3)  In any other part of a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement, “Replacement Product Disclosure Statement” may be abbreviated to “RPDS”.

             (4)  Otherwise, section 1012J and Subdivision C (apart from section 1013B) apply in relation to a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement in the same way as they apply to a Product Disclosure Statement.

Note:          Section 1012J provides that the information in a Product Disclosure Statement must be up to date at the time it is given. Subdivision C deals with the preparation and content of Product Disclosure Statements.

##### <a id="1014L"></a>1014L  Giving, lodgment and notice of Replacement Product Disclosure Statements

                   Subdivision E applies in relation to a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement in the same way as it applies to a Product Disclosure Statement that is required to be lodged with ASIC under section 1015B.

Insert:

        (2BA)  If Subdivision DA applies:

                     (b)  if the responsible person gives the applicant a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement, subsection (2B) applies as if references in that subsection to a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement were references to the Replacement Product Disclosure Statement.

## 150  At the end of subsection 1016E(4)

Add:

               ; or (c)  if the statement is express or implied in a Replacement Product Disclosure Statement (whether or not it is express or implied in the earlier Product Disclosure Statement it replaces)—the date of the Replacement Product Disclosure Statement.
