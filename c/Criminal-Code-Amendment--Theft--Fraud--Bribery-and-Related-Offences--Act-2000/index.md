                     (a)  the person dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of the property; and

                     (b)  the property belongs to a Commonwealth entity.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 10 years.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Code, an offence against subsection (1) is to be known as the offence of theft.

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, a person’s appropriation of property belonging to another is taken not to be dishonest if the person appropriates the property in the belief that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps.

             (2)  However, the rule in subsection (1) does not apply if the person appropriating the property held it as trustee or personal representative.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Division, a person’s appropriation of property belonging to another may be dishonest even if the person or another person is willing to pay for the property.

##### <a id="131.3"></a>131.3  Appropriation of property

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, any assumption of the rights of an owner to ownership, possession or control of property, without the consent of the person to whom it belongs, amounts to an appropriation of the property.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Division, if property, or a right or interest in property, is, or purports to be, transferred or given to a person acting in good faith, a later assumption by the person of rights which the person had believed himself or herself to be acquiring does not, because of any defect in the transferor’s title, amount to an appropriation of the property.

##### <a id="131.4"></a>131.4  Theft of land or things forming part of land

             (1)  For the purposes of this Division, a person cannot commit theft of land, except in the following cases:

                     (b)  the person is under a legal obligation to make restoration (in whole or in part) of the property or its proceeds;

then, to the extent of that obligation, the property or proceeds belongs (as against the person) to the person entitled to restoration.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Division, an intention not to make restoration is:

                     (a)  an intention to permanently deprive the person so entitled of the property or proceeds; and

                     (b)  an appropriation of the property or proceeds without the consent of the person entitled to restoration.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a **_fundamental mistake_** is:

                     (a)  a mistake about the identity of the person getting the property; or

                     (b)  a mistake as to the essential nature of the property; or

                     (a)  a person appropriates property belonging to another without meaning the other permanently to lose the thing itself; and

                     (b)  the person’s intention is to treat the thing as the person’s own to dispose of regardless of the other’s rights;

the person has the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, a borrowing or lending of a thing amounts to treating the thing as the borrower’s or lender’s own to dispose of regardless of another’s rights if, and only if, the borrowing or lending is for a period and in circumstances making it equivalent to an outright taking or disposal.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, if:
