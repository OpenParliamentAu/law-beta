_action_ means a proceeding of a civil nature between parties, and

includes a counterclaim. _Australian protected person_ has the same meaning as in regulation 5 of the Australian Citizenship Regulations. _circuit layout_ means a representation, fixed in any material form, of the three-dimensional location of the active and passive elements and interconnections making up an integrated circuit. _commercially exploited_ has the meaning given in section&#160;8\. _eligible foreign country_ means a foreign country declared by the regulations to be an eligible foreign country for the purposes of this Act. _eligible layout_ means an original circuit layout:  </dl></dl>
