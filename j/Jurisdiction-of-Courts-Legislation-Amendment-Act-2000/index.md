Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975

## 1  After section 43A

Insert:

## Part IVA—Appeals and references of questions of law to the Federal Court of Australia

##### <a id="43B"></a>43B  Part applies whether Tribunal’s power conferred by an enactment or by a law of a State or the ACT

             (1)  This Part applies in relation to a proceeding that was before the Tribunal before the commencement of this section, or that is before the Tribunal after that commencement, under power conferred on it by or under:

                     (a)  an enactment; or

                     (b)  a law of a State or of the Australian Capital Territory.

             (2)  This Part has effect in relation to a proceeding before the Tribunal under power conferred on it by a law of a State or of the Australian Capital Territory as if a reference in this Part to a provision of this Act that is not in this Part were a reference to that provision as applying as a law of the State or of the Australian Capital Territory, as the case requires.

## 2  Effect of amended Act  in relation to appellable State or Territory decisions

Definitions

(1)        In this item:

**_amended Act_** means the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as in force after the commencement.

**_appellable_****_State_****_decision_** means a decision of the Tribunal made in the exercise of power conferred on the Tribunal by or under a law of a State.

**_appellable_****_Territory_****_decision_** means a decision of the Tribunal made in the exercise of power conferred on the Tribunal by or under a law of the Australian Capital Territory or of the Northern Territory.

**_commencement_** means the commencement of the amendments of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ made by this Schedule.

**_State_** does not include the Northern Territory.

**_Tribunal_** has the same meaning as in the amended Act.

Appellable State decisions made before the commencement—situations in which period for appealing under amended Act is extended

(2)        In each of the following situations, the amended Act applies in relation to a person and an appellable State decision as if the 28 day period referred to in subsection 44(2A) of that Act began on the commencement:

                     (a)  the first situation—the decision was made before the commencement and that 28 day period would otherwise have begun during the period starting on 20 May 1999 and ending immediately before the commencement;

                     (b)  the second situation—before 17 June 1999, the Federal Court of Australia, purporting to Act under subsection 44(2A) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as purportedly applied as a law of a State, made an order allowing the person further time to make an appeal from that decision and that period of time had not expired by 17 June 1999;

                     (c)  the third situation—immediately before 17 June 1999, proceedings by way of an appeal by the person from the decision were before the Federal Court of Australia under section 44 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as purportedly applied as a law of a State.

_Note:       The power under subsection 44(2A) of the amended Act to extend the time for appealing from a decision of the Tribunal is available even if the decision is an appellable State decision and the 28 day time limit that would otherwise apply expired before the commencement._

Appellable Territory decisions—ACT and NT laws no longer operate to apply sections 44 to 46 of the AAT Act

(3)        A law of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory that provides for the application of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as a law of that Territory is of no effect after the commencement so far as that law purports to apply all or any of sections 44 to 46 of that Act in relation to an appellable Territory decision (whenever it was made).

_Note:       Part IVA of the amended Act applies to these decisions._

Appellable Territory decisions—proceedings under sections 44 to 46 continue after the commencement under the amended Act

(4)        If, immediately before the commencement, proceedings in relation to an appellable Territory decision were before a court under any of sections 44 to 46 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as applying as a law of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory, then, from the commencement, those proceedings continue as if they had been commenced in that court under the amended Act.

Appellable Territory decisions—continued effect of orders made before the commencement under sections 44 to 46

(5)        An order made by a court before the commencement under any of sections 44 to 46 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ as applying as a law of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory has effect, from the commencement, as if it had been made by that court under the amended Act.
