             (1)  When any cause or matter, after being fully heard before a Full Court, is ordered to stand for judgment, it is not necessary that all the Justices before whom it was heard be present together in court to declare their opinions on the cause or matter, but the opinion of any of them may be reduced to writing and may be read or otherwise made known by any other Justice at any subsequent sitting of a Full Court at which judgment in the cause or matter is delivered. At that subsequent sitting, it is only necessary for a single Justice to be present in court for the purpose of delivering that judgment.

             (2)  In any such case the question shall be decided in the same manner, and the judgment of the Court has the same force and effect, as if the Justice whose opinion is so read or otherwise made known had been present in court and had declared his or her opinion in person.

##### <a id="77MA"></a>77MA  Interest up to judgment

             (1)  In any proceedings, other than proceedings on appeal, for the recovery of any money (including any debt or damages or the value of any goods) in respect of a cause of action that arises after the commencement of this section, the High Court shall, upon application, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, either:

                     (a)  order that there be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest at such rate as the Court thinks fit on the whole or any part of the money for the whole or part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date as of which judgment is entered; or

                     (a)  compensation in respect of liabilities incurred which do not carry interest as against the person claiming interest or claiming a sum in lieu of interest;

                     (b)  compensation for loss or damage to be incurred or suffered after the date on which judgment is given; or

                     (c)  exemplary or punitive damages;

interest, or a sum in lieu of interest, shall not be given under subsection (1) in respect of any such amount or in respect of so much of the relevant sum as in the opinion of the Court represents any such amount.

             (4)  Subsection (3) shall not be taken to preclude interest or a sum in lieu of interest being given, pursuant to this section, upon compensation in respect of a liability of the kind referred to in paragraph (3)(a) where that liability has been met by the plaintiff, as from the date upon which that liability was so met.

##### <a id="77N"></a>77N  Interest on judgment debts

                   When any claim is made to property taken in execution upon process issued out of the High Court, the Marshal or a Deputy Marshal may take in the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the property is situated the same proceedings by way of interpleader as if the process had been issued out of that Supreme Court, and that Supreme Court and the Judges of that Supreme Court have jurisdiction to entertain and determine the matter.

##### <a id="77Q"></a>77Q  Discharge of property taken in execution

                   A seizure or attachment of property in execution upon process issued out of the High Court becomes inoperative upon the occurrence of any event by which, according to the laws of the State or Territory in which the property is situated, the seizure or attachment would become inoperative if made upon like process issued out of the Supreme Court of that State or Territory.

### Division 6—Receivers and managers

##### <a id="77R"></a>77R  Receivers and managers

             (1)  The High Court may, at any stage of a proceeding and on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit, appoint a receiver or manager in any case in which it appears to the Court to be just or convenient to do so.

             (2)  A receiver or manager appointed under subsection (1) may, without the previous leave of the High Court, be sued in respect of any act or transaction done or entered into by him or her in carrying on the business connected with the property of which he or she is receiver or manager.

             (3)  When in any cause pending in the High Court a receiver or manager appointed by the Court is in possession of any property, the receiver or manager shall manage and deal with the property according to the requirements of the laws of the State or Territory in which the property is situated in the same manner as that in which the owner or possessor of the property would be bound to do if in possession of the property.

##### <a id="77V"></a>77V  Death of party to an appeal

             (1)  When a party to a judgment from which an appeal lies to the High Court has, whether before or after the commencement of this section, died before the time allowed for instituting an appeal has expired, it is not necessary to revive the cause or matter by any formal proceedings.

             (2)  If the personal representative of the deceased party desires to appeal, he or she may file in the Court by which the judgment was given or made a duly certified copy of the instrument by which he or she is appointed, and thereupon may institute an appeal in the same manner as the party whom he or she represents might have done.

             (3)  In the case of the death of the party in whose favour the judgment is given or made, notice of appeal may be given to his or her personal representative, or, if there is no such representative, to such person as the High Court directs.

##### <a id="78A"></a>78A  Intervention by Attorneys-General

             (1)  The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Attorney-General of a State may, on behalf of the State, intervene in proceedings before the High Court or any other federal court or any court of a State or Territory, being proceedings that relate to a matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation.

             (2)  Where the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of a State intervenes in proceedings in a court under this section, the court may, in the proceedings, make such order as to costs against the Commonwealth or the State, as the case may be, as the court thinks fit.

             (3)  Where the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of a State intervenes in proceedings in a court under this section, then, for the purposes of the institution and prosecution of an appeal from a judgment given in the proceedings, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or the State, as the case may be, shall be taken to be a party to the proceedings.

             (4)  Where the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of a State institutes an appeal from a judgment given in proceedings in which the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or the State, as the case may be, has intervened under this section, a court hearing the appeal may make such order as to costs against the Commonwealth or the State, as the case may be, as the court thinks fit.

##### <a id="78B"></a>78B  Notice to Attorneys-General

             (1)  Where a cause pending in a federal court including the High Court or in a court of a State or Territory involves a matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation, it is the duty of the court not to proceed in the cause unless and until the court is satisfied that notice of the cause, specifying the nature of the matter has been given to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and of the States, and a reasonable time has elapsed since the giving of the notice for consideration by the Attorneys-General, of the question of intervention in the proceedings or removal of the cause to the High Court.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a court in which a cause referred to in that subsection is pending:

                     (a)  may adjourn the proceedings in the cause for such time as it thinks necessary and may make such order as to costs in relation to such an adjournment as it thinks fit;

                     (c)  may continue to hear evidence and argument concerning matters severable from any matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation.

             (5)  Nothing in subsection (1) prevents a court from proceeding without delay to hear and determine proceedings, so far as they relate to the grant of urgent relief of an interlocutory nature, where the court thinks it necessary in the interests of justice to do so.

### Division 2—Application of laws

##### <a id="79"></a>79  State or Territory laws to govern where applicable

             (1)  The laws of each State or Territory, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence, and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State or Territory in all cases to which they are applicable.

             (2)  A provision of this Act does not prevent a law of a State or Territory covered by subsection (3) from binding a court under this section in connection with a suit relating to the recovery of an amount paid in connection with a tax that a law of a State or Territory invalidly purported to impose.

             (3)  This subsection covers a law of a State or Territory that would be applicable to the suit if it did not involve federal jurisdiction, including, for example, a law doing any of the following:

                     (b)  requiring prior notice to be given to the person against whom the suit is brought;

                     (a)  an amount paid as the tax;

##### <a id="80"></a>80  Common law to govern

                   So far as the laws of the Commonwealth are not applicable or so far as their provisions are insufficient to carry them into effect, or to provide adequate remedies or punishment, the common law in Australia as modified by the Constitution and by the statute law in force in the State or Territory in which the Court in which the jurisdiction is exercised is held shall, so far as it is applicable and not inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth, govern all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in the exercise of their jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters.

##### <a id="80A"></a>80A  Application of sections 79 and 80 to Territory courts

##### <a id="82"></a>82  Venue in suits for penalties

##### <a id="83"></a>83  Venue in suits for taxes

##### <a id="84"></a>84  Venue in suits for forfeiture

                   Proceedings on seizures made on the high seas for forfeiture under any law of the Commonwealth may be prosecuted in any State or Territory into which the property seized is brought. Proceedings on such seizures made within any State or Territory shall be prosecuted in the State or Territory where the seizure is made, except in cases when it is otherwise provided by law.

##### <a id="85"></a>85  Property seized as forfeited

                   All property taken or obtained by any officer or person under the authority of any revenue law of the Commonwealth shall be deemed to be in the custody of the law, and subject only to the orders and judgments of the Courts having jurisdiction thereof under this or any Act.

### Division 4—Rules of Court

##### <a id="86"></a>86  Rules of Court

             (1)  The Justices of the High Court or a majority of them may make Rules of Court necessary or convenient to be made for carrying into effect the provisions of this Act or so much of the provisions of any other Act as confers jurisdiction on the High Court or relates to the practice or procedure of the High Court, and in particular for the following matters, that is to say:

             (2)  The _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ (other than sections 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 16 of that Act) applies in relation to rules of court made by the Court under this Act or another Act:

                     (a)  as if a reference to a legislative instrument were a reference to a rule of court; and

                     (c)  subject to such further modifications or adaptations as are provided for in regulations made under paragraph 88(cb) of this Act.

             (3)  Despite the fact that section 16 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ does not apply in relation to rules of court made by the Court under this Act or another Act, the Department may provide assistance in the drafting of any of those Rules if the Chief Justice so desires.

## Schedule 2  

## 1  Definitions

In this Schedule:

**_AGS_** means the Australian Government Solicitor established under the _Judiciary Act 1903_.

**_commencement time_** means the time when this Schedule commences.

**_former AGS_** means the Australian Government Solicitor established under the _Judiciary Act 1903_ as in force immediately before the commencement of Schedule 1.

## 2  AGS successor in law

(1)        The AGS is the successor in law of the former AGS.

(2)        Without limiting subitem (1), if:

                     (a)  the former AGS was acting in relation to a matter before the commencement time; and

                     (b)  the matter continues after the commencement time;

the AGS is taken to be substituted for the former AGS, for all purposes, in relation to the matter and all references to the former AGS in relation to the matter are taken to be references to the AGS.

## 3  Business of former AGS

At the commencement time, the business of the former AGS becomes the business of the AGS.

## 4  Existing conditions of staff

An officer or employee within the meaning of the _Public Service_ Act _1922_ transferred to the AGS under section 81C of that Act is to be employed on terms and conditions no less favourable than applied to the officer or employee immediately prior to his or her transfer.

                     (b)  a declaration that a specified instrument in relation to a specified asset continues to have effect after the asset vests in the AGS as if a reference in the instrument to the Commonwealth were a reference to the AGS;

                     (c)  a declaration that the AGS becomes the Commonwealth’s successor in law in relation to a specified asset immediately after the asset vests in the AGS.

(2)        A declaration has effect accordingly.

(3)        Subitem (1) does not prevent the Commonwealth from transferring an asset to the AGS otherwise than under that subitem.

## 6  Attorney-General may transfer Commonwealth liabilities to new AGS

(1)        The Attorney-General may, by writing, make any or all of the following declarations:

                     (a)  a declaration that a specified liability ceases to be a liability of the Commonwealth and becomes a liability of the AGS at a specified time;

                     (b)  a declaration that a specified instrument relating to a specified liability continues to have effect after the liability becomes a liability of the AGS, as if a reference in the instrument to the Commonwealth were a reference to the AGS;

                     (c)  a declaration that the AGS becomes the Commonwealth’s successor in law in relation to a specified liability immediately after the liability becomes a liability of the AGS.

(2)        A declaration has effect accordingly.

(3)        Subitem (1) does not prevent the Commonwealth from transferring a liability to the AGS otherwise than under that subitem.

## 7  Transfer of records

(1)        The Secretary to the Attorney-General’s Department may transfer to the AGS records of the Commonwealth that relate to the functions of the AGS.

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in paragraph 6(b) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this  Act  of the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_.

             (2)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (e)  it had provided for such modifications of the operation of that section as are necessary to ensure that the effect of the applied provisions of Part XII of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ is preserved.

             (5)  In this section:

## 10  Effect of declared rights and liabilities

(1)        A right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by item 9 in relation to an ineffective order of a court of summary jurisdiction:

(4)        In this item:

**_enforcement law_** means a provision of a law of the Commonwealth, other than a law relating to contempt of court, that sets out a consequence for a person if the person:

## 12  Powers of courts in relation to declared rights and liabilities

(1)        A court may vary, revoke, set aside, revive or suspend a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by item 9 in relation to an ineffective order of a court of summary jurisdiction as if it were a right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by an order made by that court of summary jurisdiction, in the exercise of its federal jurisdiction, in or in relation to the proceedings for the order.

(2)        In addition to its powers under subitem (1), a court (the **_review court_**) also has power to make an order achieving any other result that could have been achieved if:

                     (b)  failed to satisfy or comply with a liability imposed or affected by item 9 in relation to an ineffective order of a court of summary jurisdiction;

the interference or failure is, and is taken always to have been, a matter that can be dealt with in the same manner as if the interference or failure had been in relation to a right conferred or affected, or a liability imposed or affected, by a valid judgment of that court.

## 14  Evidence

The court record, or a copy of the court record, of an ineffective order may be adduced in evidence to show the existence, nature and extent of each right or liability conferred, imposed or affected by item 9.
