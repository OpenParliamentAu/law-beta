       (2AA)  A Judge (not being a Judge to whom subsection (1) applies) who has retired may apply to the Attorney-General for a certificate under subsection (2) that his or her retirement was due to permanent disability or infirmity and, upon receipt of that application, the Attorney-General shall:
