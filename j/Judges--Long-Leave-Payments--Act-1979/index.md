                     (c)  a person who was a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory immediately before the commencement of the _A.C.T. Supreme Court (Transfer) Act 1992_.

the person is taken, for the purposes of this Act, not to retire when the earlier appointment terminates.

                    <a name="qualifi-servic"></a>**_qualifying service_**, in relation to a Judge, means the period of his or her service as a Judge, other than any period of such service in respect of which the Judge has taken long leave or has been paid in lieu of such leave.

                    <a name="servic-judg"></a>**_service as a Judge_**, in relation to a Judge, means the period that is to be regarded, in relation to the Judge, as service as a Judge for the purposes of section 6 of the _Judges’ Pensions Act 1968_.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Recipient of payment under section 4

             (1)  An amount payable under section 4 on the retirement of a Judge is payable to the Judge.

             (2)  An amount payable under section 4 on the death of a Judge is payable to:

                     (a)  where the Judge leaves a widow or widower—that widow or widower;

                     (b)  where the Judge does not leave a widow or widower but leaves a dependant or dependants—that dependant or those dependants; or

                     (c)  in any other case—the legal personal representative of the Judge.

             (3)  Where an amount is payable under paragraph (2)(b) to the dependants of a Judge, the Attorney-General may give a direction as to the distribution of the amount between or among those dependants.

             (4)  Where an amount is payable under this section to a person who is under a legal disability, the Attorney-General may, instead of authorizing payment of the amount to the person, authorize payment of the amount to such trustee or trustees as the Attorney-General appoints to be held by that trustee or those trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the person as the Attorney-General directs.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Appropriation
