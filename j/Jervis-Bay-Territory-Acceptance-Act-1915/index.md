Preamble
		WHEREAS the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales (in this Act referred to as the State) have entered into an agreement, set out in the Schedule to this Act, for the surrender to and acceptance by the Commonwealth of the territory set out in the said agreement: And whereas it is desirable that the said agreement be ratified and confirmed and that the surrender of the territory be accepted by the Commonwealth: Be it therefore enacted by the King’s Most Excellent Majesty, the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, as follows:

		This Act may be cited as the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915.
2  Commencement [see Notes 1 and 2]
		This Act shall commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation, after the Act passed by the Parliament of the State confirming the said agreement and surrendering the territory to the Commonwealth has been proclaimed by the Governor of the State to be in force.
2A  Interpretation
		In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:
Act does not include an enactment.
enactment has the same meaning as in the Australian Capital Territory (Self‑Government) Act 1988.
Ordinance means an Ordinance made under this Act.
Territory means the Jervis Bay Territory.
3  Ratification of agreement
		The agreement made between the Commonwealth and the State and set out in the Schedule to this Act is hereby ratified and confirmed.

	(4)	The territory so accepted shall be known as the Jervis Bay Territory.
4A  Laws of Australian Capital Territory to be in force
	(1)	Subject to this Act, the laws (including the principles and rules of common law and equity) in force from time to time in the Australian Capital Territory are, so far as they are applicable to the Territory and are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in force in the Territory as if the Territory formed part of the Australian Capital Territory.
	(2)	Subsection (1) extends to:
	(a)	sections 6 and 7 of the Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909; and
	(b)	the whole of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 except sections 9 and 12 of that Act;
but does not extend to any other Act or provision of an Act.
4B  Powers and functions under adopted laws
	(1)	Subject to subsection (2), where, by a law of the Australian Capital Territory in force in the Territory because of section 4A, a power or function is vested in a person or authority (not being a court), that power or function is, in relation to the Territory, vested in, and may be exercised or performed by, that person or authority.
	(2)	The Governor‑General may direct that a power or function vested in a person or authority (not being a court) by a law of the Australian Capital Territory in force in the Territory because of section 4A shall, in relation to the Territory, be vested in, and may be exercised or performed by, such other person or authority as the Governor‑General specifies.
4C  Ordinance may amend or repeal adopted laws
		A law in force in the Territory because of section 4A may be amended or repealed by an Ordinance or by a law made under an Ordinance.
4D  Supreme Court of Australian Capital Territory to have jurisdiction in Territory
	(1)	Each court of the Australian Capital Territory has jurisdiction in and in relation to the Territory, and the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933 and the practice and procedure of each such court for the time being in force apply in the Territory as if the Territory formed part of the Australian Capital Territory.
	(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1), a reference in the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933 to an Ordinance or enactment is a reference to an Ordinance or enactment, as the case may be, in force under this Act.
4E  Supply of water or electricity to persons outside the Territory
		The Minister may, on such terms and conditions as are agreed upon, supply water or electricity from the Territory to any person outside the Territory.
4F  Ordinances
	(1)	The Governor‑General may make Ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the Territory.
	(2)	Notice of the making of an Ordinance shall be published in the Gazette, and an Ordinance shall, unless the contrary intention appears in the Ordinance, come into operation on the date of publication of the notice.
4G  Tabling of Ordinances in Parliament
	(1)	An Ordinance shall be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the making of the Ordinance, and, if it is not so laid before each House of the Parliament, ceases to have effect.
	(2)	If either House of the Parliament, in pursuance of a motion of which notice has been given within 15 sitting days after an Ordinance has been laid before that House, passes a resolution disallowing the Ordinance or a part of the Ordinance, the Ordinance or part so disallowed thereupon ceases to have effect.
	(3)	If, at the expiration of 15 sitting days after notice of a motion to disallow an Ordinance or part of an Ordinance has been given in a House of the Parliament, being notice given within 15 sitting days after the Ordinance has been laid before that House:
	(a)	the notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on; or
	(b)	the motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of;
the Ordinance or part, as the case may be, specified in the motion shall thereupon be deemed to have been disallowed.

	(a)	the House of Representatives is dissolved or expires, or the Parliament is prorogued; and

the Ordinance shall, for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), be deemed to have been laid before that first‑mentioned House on the first sitting day of that first‑mentioned House after the dissolution, expiry or prorogation, as the case may be.
	(5)	Where an Ordinance is disallowed, or is deemed to have been disallowed, under this section or ceases to have effect by virtue of the operation of subsection (1), the disallowance of the Ordinance or the operation of subsection (1) in relation to the Ordinance, as the case may be, has the same effect as a repeal of the Ordinance.

the disallowance of the relevant Ordinance or the operation of subsection (1) in relation to the relevant Ordinance, as the case may be, has the effect of reviving that other Ordinance or law, as the case may be, from and including the date of the disallowance or the date on which the relevant Ordinance ceased to have effect by virtue of that operation of subsection (1), as the case may be, as if the relevant Ordinance had not been made.
	(7)	A reference in subsection (5) or (6) to an Ordinance shall be read as including a reference to a part of an Ordinance and a reference in subsection (6) to a law has a corresponding meaning.
4H  Ordinance not to be re‑made while required to be tabled

	(2)	The period referred to in subsection (1) is the period starting on the day on which the original Ordinance was made and ending at the end of 7 days after:

	(b)	if the original Ordinance has been so laid before both Houses on different days—the later of those days; or
	(c)	if the original Ordinance has not been so laid before both Houses—the last day on which subsection 4G(1) could have been complied with.

4J  Ordinance not to be re‑made while subject to disallowance
