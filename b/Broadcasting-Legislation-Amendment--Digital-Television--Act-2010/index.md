##### <a id="130ZB"></a>130ZB  Objectives of conditional access scheme

Scope

             (1)  This section applies to a commercial television broadcasting licence allocated under section 38C.

Objectives

             (2)  A conditional access scheme for the section 38C licence area complies with this section if the scheme is directed towards the achievement of the objectives set out in this section.

             (3)  The first objective is that:

                     (a)  the scheme should specify the related terrestrial licence areas as areas that are taken to be areas (**_category A reception_** **_areas_**) in which people are unable to receive adequate reception of all of the applicable terrestrial digital commercial television broadcasting services; and

                     (b)  if a terrestrial licensee for a related terrestrial licence area is authorised, under paragraph 7(2A)(d) of Schedule 2, to provide a commercial television broadcasting service outside the related terrestrial licence area to one or more persons who are in the section 38C licence area—the scheme should provide that those persons are taken in to be in a category A reception area.

             (4)  The second objective is that the scheme should:

                     (a)  specify one or more areas included in the section 38C licence area; or

                     (b)  specify a method for ascertaining one or more areas included in the section 38C licence area;

that are taken to be areas (**_category B reception_** **_areas_**) in which people are unable to receive adequate reception of all of the applicable terrestrial digital commercial television broadcasting services.

             (5)  The third objective is that a conditional access system that relates to any of the commercial television broadcasting services provided under the section 38C licence must enable persons in:

                     (a)  a category A reception area; or

                     (b)  a category B reception area;

to receive those commercial television broadcasting services.

             (6)  Subsection (5) has effect subject to subsections (14) and (15).

             (7)  The fourth objective is that the scheme should provide that so much of the section 38C licence area as is neither:

                     (a)  a category A reception area; nor

                     (b)  a category B reception area;

is a **_category C reception area_**.

             (8)  The fifth objective is that the scheme must:

                     (a)  if the scheme is developed by a body or association that the ACMA is satisfied represents commercial television broadcasting licensees—identify a company; or

                     (b)  if the scheme is formulated by the ACMA—identify the ACMA;

as the **_scheme administrator_** for the scheme.

             (9)  The sixth objective is that the scheme must authorise the scheme administrator to issue a certificate (a **_reception certificate_**) to a person in a category C reception area stating that the person is unable to receive adequate reception of all of the applicable terrestrial digital commercial television broadcasting services.

           (10)  The seventh objective is that a conditional access system that relates to any of the commercial television broadcasting services provided under the section 38C licence must enable a person who:

                     (a)  is in a category C reception area; and

                     (b)  holds a reception certificate;

to receive those commercial television broadcasting services.

           (11)  Subsection (10) has effect subject to subsections (14) and (15).

           (12)  The eighth objective is that, if an application for a reception certificate is made in accordance with the scheme, the application must:

                     (a)  be dealt with by the scheme administrator within 15 business days after receiving the application; and

                     (b)  be accepted, and dealt with, without requiring:

                              (i)  the payment of a fee by the applicant; or

                             (ii)  the applicant to incur any expenses (other than the expense of filling in the application and sending it to the scheme administrator).

           (13)  The ninth objective is that the scheme must authorise the scheme administrator to revoke a reception certificate issued to a person if the person is no longer eligible for the reception certificate.

           (14)  The tenth objective is that, if persons are:

                     (a)  in a local market area; and

                     (b)  not in a category A reception area;

a conditional access system that relates to any of the commercial television broadcasting services provided under the section 38C licence must not enable those persons to receive those commercial television broadcasting services earlier than 6 months before the time when the local market area becomes a digital‑only local market area.

           (15)  The 11th objective is that, if persons are:

                     (a)  in a simulcast area; and

                     (b)  not in a local market area; and

                     (c)  not in a category A reception area;

a conditional access system that relates to any of the commercial television broadcasting services provided under the section 38C licence must not enable those persons to receive those commercial television broadcasting services earlier than 6 months before the end of the simulcast period for the simulcast area.

                     (a)  the replacement scheme is formulated by the ACMA; and

                     (b)  the replacement scheme differs in only minor respects from the original scheme;

section 130ZCA has effect, in relation to the registration of the scheme, as if subsections 130ZCA(5) and (6) had not been enacted.

             (4)  The Register is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="130ZF"></a>130ZF  ACMA may direct a scheme administrator to issue a reception certificate etc.

Scope

                     (c)  the person considers that he or she does not have adequate reception of all of the applicable terrestrial digital commercial television broadcasting services.

Note:          For **_applicable terrestrial digital commercial television broadcasting services_**, see section 130ZG.

Investigation of complaint

             (2)  The person may make a complaint to the ACMA about the matter, so long as:

             (6)  The specified period must not be longer than 28 days.

             (7)  In deciding whether to give a direction under subsection (5), it is to be presumed that the person does not have adequate reception of all of the applicable terrestrial digital commercial television broadcasting services, unless the scheme administrator satisfies the ACMA that the person has adequate reception of all of those services.

Consultation

             (8)  Before giving a direction under subsection (5), the ACMA must, by written notice given to the scheme administrator:

                     (a)  invite the scheme administrator to make a submission to the ACMA, within the time limit specified in the notice, about the question of whether the person has adequate reception of all of the applicable terrestrial digital commercial television broadcasting services; and

Compliance with direction

           (10)  The scheme administrator must comply with a direction under subsection (5).

           (11)  If the scheme administrator does not comply with a direction under subsection (5), then:

                     (a)  this Act; and

                     (b)  the conditional access scheme;

have effect as if, at the end of the last day for compliance, the scheme administrator had issued a reception certificate to the person.

Determination that reception certificate is taken to have been issued to complainant

           (12)  If the person makes a complaint under paragraph (2)(c), the ACMA may determine that:

                     (a)  this Act; and

                     (b)  the conditional access scheme;

have effect as if the scheme administrator had issued a reception certificate to the person.

Revocation of reception certificate taken to have been issued

           (13)  This Act does not prevent the subsequent revocation of a reception certificate that is taken to have been issued under subsection (11) or (12).

Notification of results of investigation

                     (a)  the person makes a complaint under subsection (2); and

the ACMA must notify the person of the results of the investigation.

##### <a id="130ZFA"></a>130ZFA  Adequate reception
