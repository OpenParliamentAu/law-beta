##### <a id="7"></a>7  Act not limited to agricultural pests

                   The fact that certain powers of the Authority under this Act cannot be exercised except on the recommendation of the Council does not imply that the only kinds of organisms that may be regarded as causing harm for the purposes of this Act are kinds that are harmful by reason of their effect on agriculture.

the Authority may, by notice published in the _Gazette_, declare that law to be a relevant State law for the purposes of this Act.

             (2)  A power so delegated, when exercised by the delegate, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to have been exercised by the Authority.

             (3)  A delegation under this section does not prevent the exercise of a power by the Authority.

is satisfied:

                     (c)  that the release of organisms of the kind to which the recommendation relates (in this subsection referred to as the **_relevant organisms_**) could result in the control of target organisms of a particular kind or kinds in the Australian Capital Territory; and

                              (i)  the release of the relevant organisms would not cause any significant harm to any person or to the environment, other than the harm (if any) resulting from the control throughout Australia of target organisms of that kind or those kinds; or

                             (ii)  any harm caused to persons or to the environment by the release of the relevant organisms, other than the harm (if any) resulting from the control throughout Australia of target organisms of that kind or those kinds, would be significantly less than:

                                        (B)  where target organisms of that kind or those kinds can be controlled by the release of other organisms or otherwise than by biological means—the harm (if any) caused, or likely to be caused, by controlling target organisms of that kind or those kinds throughout Australia by the release of those other organisms or by those other means;

the Authority, subject to subsection (1A), shall, by notice published in the _Gazette_, declare the relevant organisms to be agent organisms for the purposes of this Act.
