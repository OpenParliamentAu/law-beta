##### <a id="4"></a>4  Effect on Federation of cancellation of registration

             (1)  Subsection 143(5) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not apply in relation to the Federation or its members but subsections 143(4) and (6) of that Act apply in spite of the repeal of that Act.

             (2)  Any award that would, but for this subsection, apply to the Federation or its members does not have any effect in relation to the Federation or its members.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (3A), a non-registered association is not capable of being a party to, and shall not be permitted to intervene in, a proceeding before the Commission and is not capable of being a party to an award made by the Commission.

                     (a)  by leave of the Commission, granted under section 43 of the Industrial Relations Act, intervene in a proceeding before the Commission under the Industrial Relations Act in relation to the possible exercise by the Commission of its powers under subparagraphs 111(1)(g)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Industrial Relations Act;

                     (b)  make an objection under section 253 of the Industrial Relations Act, or under regulations made under that Act in relation to a proceeding under Part IX of that Act, and be heard in relation to that objection.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), the Commission does not have any powers under the Industrial Relations Act in relation to:

                     (a)  an industrial dispute in so far as that industrial dispute resulted from:

                              (i)  an act done by a non-registered association or by persons who are members of a non-registered association; or

                             (ii)  an act done by an employer as defined by subsection 4(1) of the Industrial Relations Act in relation to a non-registered association or in relation to persons who are members of a non-registered association; or

                     (b)  an industrial issue within the meaning of section 5 of the Industrial Relations Act, so far as that industrial issue relates to a claim made by a non-registered association or by persons who are members of a non-registered association.

             (5)  Nothing in this section prevents the Commission from exercising powers under the Industrial Relations Act in relation to an industrial dispute in so far as that industrial dispute involves members of an association of employees that is an organisation within the meaning of that Act who are also members of a non-registered association.

             (6)  Where a State association is a party to, or intervenes in, a proceeding before a State industrial authority, a member of the Commission is not prevented by this section from exercising the powers of the Commission under section 175 of the Industrial Relations Act in the presence of that State industrial authority.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Registration

             (1)  Notwithstanding anything in Division 1 of Part IX of the Industrial Relations Act, a non-registered association is not entitled to apply to be, or to be, registered under that Division unless:

                     (a)  a period of 10 years has elapsed from the day of commencement of the _Builders Labourers’ Federation (Cancellation of Registration) Act 1986_;

                     (b)  the Commission, on application by the non-registered association, has declared that it is satisfied that:

                              (i)  if the non-registered association were registered under that Division, the non-registered association would not engage in conduct inimical to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes by means of conciliation and arbitration; and

                             (ii)  the registration of the non-registered association under that section would not prevent or seriously hinder the achievement of an object of the Industrial Relations Act; and

                     (c)  the requirements of the Industrial Relations Act, and of the regulations in force under that Act, that would, apart from this section, apply in relation to an application by the non-registered association for registration under Division 1 of Part IX of that Act have been complied with.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Powers and procedure of Commission

             (1)  The powers of the Commission under or by virtue of this Act are exercisable by a Full Bench of the Commission established under subsection 30(2) of the Industrial Relations Act.

             (2)  The provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, and of the regulations in force under that Act, with respect to the procedure and powers of the Commission in relation to proceedings before the Commission under that Act apply, so far as they are capable of application, in relation to proceedings before the Commission under or by virtue of this Act.

             (3)  On an application under paragraph 5(1)(b), the Minister, the non-registered association and any person granted leave to intervene may be represented by counsel or solicitor.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Eligibility of certain building industry employees for membership of certain organizations

             (1)  A reference in this section to a relevant industry is a reference to an industry in or in connection with which The Australian Building Construction Employees’ and Builders Labourers’ Federation was, immediately before the commencement of the _Builders Labourers’ Federation (Cancellation of Registration) Act 1986_, registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

             (2)  Where the Secretary or another executive officer of an association of employees that is an organisation within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act has consented in writing to persons who are, or are usually, employed in work of a specified kind or class, in Australia or in a specified part or parts of Australia, in a relevant industry being made eligible for membership of that organization, the regulations may declare those persons to be eligible for membership of that organization, and, where the regulations so declare, those regulations have effect according to their tenor notwithstanding anything in the rules of that organization as in force at the time when the regulations came into operation.

             (3)  The making of regulations for the purposes of this section declaring persons referred to in the regulations to be eligible for membership of an association of employees that is an organisation within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act does not preclude the making of any alteration to the rules of that organization and, if an alteration so made which has been consented to under section 234 of that Act is inconsistent with the terms of the regulations, the regulations, to the extent of the inconsistency, cease to have effect.

             (4)  Regulations made for the purposes of this section continue in force notwithstanding that a non-registered association becomes registered under the Industrial Relations Act.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or

                     (b)  necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.
