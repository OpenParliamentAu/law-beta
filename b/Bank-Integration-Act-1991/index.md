##### <a id="17"></a>17  Legal proceedings and evidence

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), where, immediately before the succession day for a receiving bank and the relevant transferring bank, proceedings (including arbitration proceedings) to which the transferring bank was a party were pending or existing in any court or tribunal, the receiving bank is, on that day, substituted for the transferring bank as a party to the proceedings and has the same rights in the proceedings as the transferring bank had.

             (2)  Subsection (1) only applies to proceedings to which BNZ Savings was a party if those proceedings relate to the business of that bank that relates to its Australian operations.

             (3)  Where, before the succession day for a receiving bank and the relevant transferring bank, documentary or other evidence would have been admissible for or against the interests of the transferring bank, that evidence is admissible, on or at any time after that day, for or against the interests of the receiving bank.

             (2)   This section does not prevent a receiving bank from:

             (2)  The terms and conditions of employment (including any accrued entitlement to employment benefits) of each person to whom this section applies are not affected by the operation or effect of this Act or of any complementary legislation.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Receiving banks to do what is necessary to carry out reorganisation

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Application of the Income Tax Assessment Acts 

             (1)  Where a succession day is fixed for a receiving bank and the relevant transferring bank, this section applies to the business of that transferring bank that becomes, on that day, the transferred business of the receiving bank.

             (2)  It is the intention of the Parliament:

                     (a)  that, on and after the succession day for a receiving bank and the relevant transferring bank, the receiving bank should, for all purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, be placed in the same position in relation to the business to which this section applies as the transferring bank would have been apart from the operation or effect of this Act and of any complementary legislation and from anything done for a purpose connected with, or arising out of, that operation or effect; and

                     (b)  that the operation or effect of this Act and of any complementary legislation and anything done for a purpose connected with, or arising out of, that operation or effect in relation to the business to which this section applies should, for all purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, be revenue neutral, that is to say that no assessable income, deduction, capital gain or capital loss should be derived, or incurred, or should accrue, by or to the transferring bank or the receiving bank in relation to that business merely because of the operation or effect of this Act and of any complementary legislation or of anything done for a purpose connected with, or arising out of, that operation or effect.

             (3)  Where a succession day is fixed for a receiving bank and the relevant transferring bank, then, for the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, nothing in this Act affects the continuity of any partnership in which a transferring bank was a partner immediately before the succession day.

             (4)  Where a succession day is fixed for a receiving bank and the relevant transferring bank, then, for the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

                     (a)  all assessable income derived or taken to be derived by the transferring bank; and

                     (b)  all allowable deductions and capital losses incurred or taken to be incurred by the transferring bank; and

                     (c)  all other consequences (including the balances of tax losses that are carried forward and foreign tax credits) for the transferring bank;

are taken to have been derived or incurred by, or to have occurred in relation to, the receiving bank and not the transferring bank.

             (5)  Where a succession day is fixed for a receiving bank and the relevant transferring bank, then, for the purposes of Part 3-6 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about the imputation system):

                     (a)  if the transferring bank has a franking surplus at the end of the day before the succession day, then, at the beginning of the succession day:

                              (i)  a franking debit equal to that franking surplus arises in the transferring bank; and

                             (ii)  a franking credit equal to that franking surplus arises in the receiving bank; and

                     (b)  if the transferring bank has a franking deficit at the end of the day before the succession day and the succession day is not the first day of the transferring bank’s income year, then, at the beginning of the succession day:

                              (i)  a franking credit equal to that franking deficit arises in the transferring bank; and

                             (ii)  a franking debit equal to that franking deficit arises in the receiving bank.

             (6)  Subsections (3), (4) and (5) do not limit the generality of subsection (2).

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Tax Law Improvement Act (No. 1) 1998 (No. 46, 1998)_

## <a id="4"></a>4  Application of amendments

An amendment made by an item in a Schedule (except an item in Schedule 1 or in Part 1 of any of Schedules 2 to 8) applies to assessments for the 1998-99 income year and later income years, unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule in which the item appears.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006-07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 5  Application of Schedule 5 amendments

The repeals and amendments made by Schedule 5 apply to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.
