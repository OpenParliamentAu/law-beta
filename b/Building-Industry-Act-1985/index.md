                     (b)  by order in writing, terminate, or suspend to the extent specified in the order, any of the rights, privileges or capacities of the Federation or of all or any of its members, as such members, under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or under the rules of the Federation (other than rules relating to the industry in or in connection with which the Federation is registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or rules relating to the conditions of eligibility for membership of the Federation).

                     (b)  if the Registrar determines that any such alterations need to be made, the Registrar shall certify in writing the alterations so determined and, upon the Registrar so certifying:

                              (i)  those rules shall be deemed to be altered accordingly; and

the Commission shall make a declaration that it is so satisfied and cause the declaration to be recorded in writing.

           (10)  Where a declaration is made by the Commission under subsection (9), subsection (1) has effect in like manner as it has effect in relation to a declaration made by the Commission under section 4.

             (2)  The Commission may make different declarations under subsection (1) in respect of different organizations of employees in respect of different kinds or classes of work.

             (3)  The Commission is not entitled to make a declaration under subsection (1) in respect of an organization of employees in respect of a kind or class of work unless the Commission is satisfied that:
