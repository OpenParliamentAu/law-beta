Example 1: Peta and Abdul are joint debtors. When they present a debtor’s petition against themselves, there is a creditor’s petition pending against Abdul. The Official Receiver must refer the debtor’s petition to the Court, because the creditor’s petition does not relate to both Peta and Abdul.

Example 2: Joan and Craig are joint debtors. When they present a debtor’s petition against themselves, there is a creditor’s petition pending against Joan, Craig and Paul. The Official Receiver must refer the debtor’s petition to the Court.

Example 3: Kim, Robin and Jane are joint debtors. When they present a debtor’s petition against themselves, there is a creditor’s petition pending against Kim, Robin and Jane, and no-one else. The Official Receiver is not required to refer the debtor’s petition to the Court.

          (3C)  If the Court directs the Official Receiver to accept the debtor’s petition, the Court must specify the time of the commencement of each bankruptcy that results from acceptance of the debtor’s petition.

             (4)  The Official Receiver must accept a debtor’s petition, unless the Official Receiver rejects it under subsection (3) or is directed by the Court to reject it.

             (5)  Where the Official Receiver accepts a petition presented under this section:

                     (a)  he or she shall endorse the petition accordingly; and

                     (b)  upon the Official Receiver endorsing the petition, each of the petitioning debtors becomes a bankrupt by force of this section and by virtue of presentation of the petition.

             (6)  If a registered trustee is the trustee of the estate of a person who becomes a bankrupt under this section, the Official Receiver must:

                     (a)  notify the trustee of the bankruptcy; and

                     (b)  give the trustee a copy of each statement of affairs that accompanied the debtor’s petition.

          (6A)  A debtor who is a party (as debtor) to a debt agreement must not present a debtor’s petition unless the Court gives the debtor permission to do so.

             (7)  A debtor who has executed a personal insolvency agreement is not entitled to join in presenting a petition under this section unless:

                     (a)  the agreement has been set aside; or

                     (b)  the agreement has been terminated; or

                     (c)  all the obligations that the agreement created have been discharged; or

                     (d)  the Court grants leave for the debtor to join in presenting a petition under this section.

             (8)  A debtor in relation to whom a stay under a proclaimed law applies is not, except with the leave of the Court, entitled to join in presenting a petition under this section.

             (9)  Where a petition is presented in contravention of subsection (6A), (7) or (8), the presentation of the petition does not have any effect.

           (10)  A person who becomes a bankrupt by force of this section continues to be a bankrupt until:

                     (a)  he or she is discharged by force of subsection 149(1); or

                     (b)  his or her bankruptcy is annulled by force of subsection 74(5) or 153A(1) or under section 153B.

           (11)  A person who states in writing that he or she is a creditor of a bankrupt who has become a bankrupt by virtue of the presentation of a debtor’s petition against joint debtors, or a creditor of joint debtors some or all of whom have become bankrupts by force of this section, may without fee, and any other person may on payment of the fee determined by the Minister by legislative instrument, inspect, personally or by an agent, any statement of affairs that accompanied the petition presented by the joint debtors, and may obtain a copy of, or take extracts from, any such statement of affairs.

           (12)  A bankrupt who has become a bankrupt by force of this section may, without fee and either personally or by an agent:

                     (a)  inspect any statement of affairs that accompanied the petition; and

                     (b)  obtain a copy of, or make extracts from, any statement of affairs that accompanied the petition.

           (13)  If the approved form for a statement of affairs indicates that particular information in the statement will not be made available to the public, then the Official Receiver must ensure that the information is not made available under this section to any person (other than a petitioning debtor or an agent of a petitioning debtor).

           (14)  The Official Receiver may refuse to allow a person access under this section to particular information in a statement of affairs on the ground that access to that information would jeopardise, or be likely to jeopardise, the safety of any person.

                   Where, after the commencement of this section, a person becomes a bankrupt by virtue of the presentation of a debtor’s petition, the person shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to become a bankrupt at the first instant of the day on which the petition is accepted by the Official Receiver.

### Division 4—Effect of bankruptcy on property and proceedings

##### <a id="58"></a>58  Vesting of property upon bankruptcy—general rule

             (1)  Subject to this Act, where a debtor becomes a bankrupt:

                     (a)  the property of the bankrupt, not being after-acquired property, vests forthwith in the Official Trustee or, if, at the time when the debtor becomes a bankrupt, a registered trustee becomes the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt by virtue of section 156A, in that registered trustee; and

                     (b)  after-acquired property of the bankrupt vests, as soon as it is acquired by, or devolves on, the bankrupt, in the Official Trustee or, if a registered trustee is the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt, in that registered trustee.

Note 1:       This subsection has a limited application if there are orders in force under the proceeds of crime law: see section 58A.

Note 2:       Even if property has vested under this section, it may, under the _Proceeds of Crime Act 2002_:

(a)           become subject to a restraining order; and

(b)           be taken into account in making a pecuniary penalty order; and

(c)           become subject to a charge to secure the payment of an amount under a pecuniary penalty order, if it is subject to a restraining order; and

(d)           be dealt with by the Official Trustee, if it is subject to a restraining order and a court has directed the Official Trustee to pay the Commonwealth an amount under a pecuniary penalty order out of property subject to the restraining order.

             (2)  Where a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth requires the transmission of property to be registered and enables the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt to be registered as the owner of any such property that is part of the property of the bankrupt, that property, notwithstanding that it vests in equity in the trustee by virtue of this section, does not so vest at law until the requirements of that law have been complied with.

             (3)  Except as provided by this Act, after a debtor has become a bankrupt, it is not competent for a creditor:

                     (a)  to enforce any remedy against the person or the property of the bankrupt in respect of a provable debt; or

                     (b)  except with the leave of the Court and on such terms as the Court thinks fit, to commence any legal proceeding in respect of a provable debt or take any fresh step in such a proceeding.

             (4)  After a debtor has become a bankrupt, distress for rent shall not be levied or proceeded with against the property of the bankrupt, whether or not the bankrupt is a tenant of the landlord by whom the distress is sought to be levied.

             (5)  Nothing in this section affects the right of a secured creditor to realize or otherwise deal with his or her security.

          (5A)  Nothing in this section shall be taken to prevent a creditor from enforcing any remedy against a bankrupt, or against any property of a bankrupt that is not vested in the trustee of the bankrupt, in respect of any liability of the bankrupt under:

                     (a)  a maintenance agreement; or

                     (b)  a maintenance order;

whether entered into or made, as the case may be, before or after the commencement of this subsection.

             (6)  In this section, **_after-acquired property_**, in relation to a bankrupt, means property that is acquired by, or devolves on, the bankrupt on or after the date of the bankruptcy, being property that is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt.

##### <a id="58A"></a>58A  Vesting of property upon bankruptcy—effect of orders in force under the proceeds of crime law

If a restraining order or forfeiture order is in force

             (1)  If property of a bankrupt is covered by a restraining order, or a forfeiture order, made before the date of the bankruptcy, subsection 58(1) does not apply to property that is covered by the order while that property is so covered.

If a pecuniary penalty order is in force

             (2)  If a pecuniary penalty order is made against a bankrupt before the date of the bankruptcy, subsection 58(1) does not apply to any of the property of the bankrupt while the order is in force.

Note:          For proceeds of crime orders made on or after the date of the bankruptcy, and applications for proceeds of crime orders, see sections 114A to 114C.

Notifying the trustee of grounds for subsection 58(1) to apply to property

             (3)  If circumstances arise as a result of which this section no longer prevents subsection 58(1) applying to property of the bankrupt, the Director of Public Prosecutions must, as soon as practicable, give the trustee written notice of the existence of the circumstances.

##### <a id="59"></a>59  Second or subsequent bankruptcy

                            shall (subject to any disposition of that property made by the trustee in the earlier bankruptcy without knowledge of the presentation of the petition on, or by virtue of the presentation of which, the person became bankrupt on the later occasion and subject also to section 126) vest forthwith in the trustee in the later bankruptcy;

                     (b)  property:

                             (ii)  shall rank equally with the ordinary unsecured creditors in the later bankruptcy; and

                            (iii)  may, where he or she has lodged a proof of debt in the later bankruptcy, amend that proof of debt, without the consent of the trustee in the later bankruptcy, for the purpose of adding:

                                        (A)  his or her expenses in the earlier bankruptcy that have, or his or her remuneration in the earlier bankruptcy that has, accrued after the proof of debt was lodged;

                                        (B)  liabilities incurred by him or her in administering the estate in the earlier bankruptcy after the proof of debt was lodged; or

                                   or, with the consent of the trustee in the later bankruptcy, for any other purpose;

                     (d)  a charge or charging order that, by virtue of subsection 118(9), is void as against the trustee in the earlier bankruptcy continues to be void as against that trustee; and

                     (e)  a transaction that, by virtue of section 120, 121, 122, 128B or 128C, is void as against the trustee in the earlier bankruptcy continues to be void as against that trustee.

             (2)  Where the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt receives notice of the presentation of a creditor’s petition against the bankrupt, the trustee shall hold the after-acquired property of the bankrupt that is then in the possession of the trustee, or the proceeds thereof, until the petition has been dealt with by the Court or has lapsed.

             (3)  Where the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt receives notice that a debtor’s petition against the bankrupt has been referred to the Court, the trustee shall hold the after-acquired property of the bankrupt that is then in the possession of the trustee, or the proceeds thereof, until the Court has dealt with the petition.

             (4)  Where the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt is holding after-acquired property of the bankrupt, or the proceeds of any such property, in pursuance of subsection (2) or (3) and the bankrupt again becomes a bankrupt, the trustee shall:

                     (a)  in a case where the trustee is also the trustee in the later bankruptcy—hold all such property, and the proceeds of such property, as the trustee in the later bankruptcy; or

                     (b)  in any other case—deliver all such property, and pay the proceeds of such property, to the trustee in the later bankruptcy.

             (5)  Where a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth requires the transmission of property to be registered, and enables the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt to be registered as the owner of any such property that is part of the property of the bankrupt, that property, notwithstanding that it vests in equity in the trustee by virtue of subsection (1), does not vest in the trustee at law until the requirements of that law have been complied with.

             (6)  In subsections (2), (3) and (4), **_after-acquired property_**, in relation to a bankrupt, means such of the property that was acquired by, or devolved on, the bankrupt on or after the date of the bankruptcy, being property divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt, as has not been distributed amongst the creditors in the bankruptcy.

             (2)  An action commenced by a person who subsequently becomes a bankrupt is, upon his or her becoming a bankrupt, stayed until the trustee makes election, in writing, to prosecute or discontinue the action.

                     (b)  a creditor, or a proxy or attorney of a creditor, participating in person or by telephone.

          (7A)  If:

                     (a)  the meeting is the first meeting of the bankrupt’s creditors and the trustee is a registered trustee; and

                     (b)  the following apply:

                              (i)  before the meeting the trustee had given a notice under section 64ZBA that contained a proposal relating to how the trustee was to be remunerated;

##### <a id="64ZB"></a>64ZB  Manner of voting [_see_ Table B]

             (1)  A creditor who participates in a meeting in person or by telephone may cast the creditor’s vote personally and not otherwise.

             (2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (5), the vote of a creditor who is not participating in a meeting in person or by telephone may be cast by a proxy duly appointed by the creditor, or by an attorney duly authorised by the creditor under a power of attorney, being a proxy or attorney participating in the meeting in person or by telephone, and the casting of a creditor’s vote by such a proxy or attorney is taken to constitute the casting of a vote by the creditor.

             (3)  A person claiming to be the proxy of a creditor is not entitled to vote as proxy unless the instrument of appointment has been lodged with the President (or with the trustee, before the President was elected), either before or after the announcement is made under section 64M about the appointment of proxies and attorneys.

          (3A)  If an instrument of appointment of a proxy is lodged with the President in substitution for another instrument with an earlier date, then the later instrument commences to have effect (from the time it is lodged with the President) in substitution for the earlier instrument.

             (4)  A creditor’s proxy or attorney is not disqualified from casting the creditor’s vote merely because the proxy or attorney is the trustee, the President or the minutes secretary.

             (5)  If the trustee or an associate of the trustee is a creditor’s proxy or attorney, the trustee or associate may not cast the creditor’s vote on a motion relating to the trustee’s remuneration unless the instrument appointing the proxy or the power of attorney, as the case may be, expressly authorises the trustee or associate to cast the creditor’s vote on such a motion.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), a person is an associate of the trustee if the person is:

                     (a)  a partner of the trustee; or

                     (b)  an employee of the trustee; or

                     (c)  a solicitor for the trustee, for a partnership in which the trustee is a partner, or for a person or partnership that employs the trustee.

             (7)  A motion proposed at a meeting is to be resolved:

                     (a)  subject to paragraph (b)—on the voices; or

                     (b)  if:

                              (i)  the President is unable to determine the result of the voting on the voices; or

                             (ii)  any of the creditors and their representatives requests a poll, whether the request is made before the motion is put to the vote on the voices or after the President announces the result of the vote on the voices; or

                            (iii)  the motion relates to a matter in respect of which this Act requires the passing of a resolution or special resolution;

                            by a poll taken:

                            (iv)  by a show of hands or written votes of creditors, or proxies or attorneys, participating in person; and

                             (v)  by statements made by telephone to the President by creditors, or proxies or attorneys, participating by telephone.

             (8)  For the purposes of determining whether a motion proposed at the meeting is resolved, the value of a creditor who:

                     (a)  has been assigned a debt; and

                     (b)  is present at the meeting personally, by telephone, by attorney or by proxy; and

                     (c)  is voting on the motion;

is to be worked out by taking the value of the assigned debt to be equal to the value of the consideration that the creditor gave for the assignment of the debt.

##### <a id="64ZBA"></a>64ZBA  Creditors’ resolution without meeting

             (1)  The trustee may at any time put a proposal to the creditors by giving a notice under this section.

             (4)  A statutory declaration verifying matters in a proof of debt lodged by a creditor may be made by:

                     (a)  the creditor; or

                     (b)  a person whose own knowledge includes the facts set out in the statutory declaration and the proof of debt, and who is authorised by the creditor to make the declaration.

             (5)  Where the trustee serves a notice on a creditor under subsection (3) in respect of a proof of debt, the proof of debt shall, for the purposes of this Act (other than section 263), be deemed not to have been lodged with the trustee unless and until the creditor has lodged with the trustee a statutory declaration verifying the matters in the proof of debt or such of those matters as are specified in the notice, as the case requires.

             (3)  The right of priority conferred by subsection (2) in respect of moneys advanced for the purpose referred to in that subsection does not extend to so much of the money so advanced as exceeds the amount by which the amount in respect of which the person who received the payment would have been entitled to priority has been diminished by reason of the payment.

                     (b)  expenses in relation to which a creditor has, or creditors have, indemnified a trustee have been recovered;

the Court may, upon the application of the trustee or a creditor, make such orders as it thinks just and equitable with respect to the distribution of that property and the amount of those expenses so recovered with a view to giving the indemnifying creditor or creditors, as the case may be, an advantage over others in consideration of the risk assumed by creditor or creditors.

           (11)  Except as provided in paragraph (1)(a), the debts in each of the classes specified in subsection (1) rank equally between themselves and shall be paid in full unless the proceeds of the property of the bankrupt are insufficient to meet them, in which case they shall be paid proportionately.

             (2)  Where, for the purposes of a bankruptcy, a trustee employs a person whose employment by the bankrupt had been terminated by reason of the bankruptcy, that person shall, for the purpose of calculating any entitlement to payment for long service leave, extended leave, annual leave, recreation leave or sick leave, be deemed, while the trustee employs that person for those purposes, to be employed by the bankrupt.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), where, after the date of a bankruptcy, an amount in respect of long service leave or extended leave becomes due to a person referred to in subsection (2) in respect of the employment so referred to, the amount is a cost of the bankruptcy.

             (4)  Where, at the date of a bankruptcy, the length of qualifying service of a person employed by the bankrupt is insufficient to entitle that person to any amount in respect of long service leave or extended leave, but, by the operation of subsection (2), that person becomes entitled to such an amount after that date, that amount:

                     (a)  is a cost of the bankruptcy to the extent of an amount that bears to that amount the same proportion as the length of that person’s qualifying service after that date bears to the total length of that person’s qualifying service; and

                     (b)  shall, to the extent of the balance of that amount, be deemed to be an amount referred to in paragraph 109(1)(g).

             (2)  Where such an indenture or such articles are so discharged and any money has been paid by or on behalf of the apprentice or clerk to the bankrupt as a fee, the trustee may, on application by or on behalf of the apprentice or clerk, pay out of the property of the bankrupt, to or for the use of the apprentice or clerk, such sum as the trustee thinks reasonable, having regard to the amount paid by or on behalf of the apprentice or clerk and to the time during which he or she has served with the bankrupt under the indenture or articles and to the other circumstances of the case.

                             (ii)  pay to the creditor, or to any person on his or her behalf, any moneys received as a result of the attachment of the debt due to the debtor;

             (7)  Where a sheriff, in pursuance of subsection (1) or (2), refrains from taking action to sell property of a debtor (being real property), the debtor becomes a bankrupt and the property vests in the trustee in the bankruptcy, the costs of the execution are a first charge on that property.

             (8)  A failure by a sheriff to comply with a provision of this section does not affect the title of a person who purchases property of a bankrupt in good faith under a sale by the sheriff in pursuance of a process of execution issued by or on behalf of a creditor.

##### <a id="119A"></a>119A  Duties of sheriff after receiving notice of bankruptcy etc.
 [_see_ Table B]

             (1)  Where a debtor has become a bankrupt (whether on a creditor’s petition or otherwise and whether before or after the commencement of this section), the trustee may give to the sheriff or to the registrar or other appropriate officer of a court, notice in writing of that fact and, upon the giving of the notice:

                     (a)  the sheriff shall deliver or pay to the trustee:

                              (i)  any property of the bankrupt in his or her possession under a process of execution issued by or on behalf of a creditor;

                             (ii)  any proceeds of the sale of property of the bankrupt or other moneys in his or her possession, being proceeds of the sale of property sold, whether before or after the bankrupt became a bankrupt, in pursuance of any such process or moneys seized, or paid to avoid seizure or sale of property of the bankrupt, whether before or after the bankrupt became a bankrupt, in pursuance of any such process; and

                            (iii)  any moneys in his or her possession as a result of the attachment, by or on behalf of a creditor, of a debt due to the bankrupt; or

                     (b)  the registrar or other officer of the court shall pay to the trustee:

                              (i)  any proceeds of the sale of property of the bankrupt or other moneys in court, being proceeds of sale or other moneys paid into court, whether before or after the bankrupt became a bankrupt, by a sheriff in pursuance of a process of execution issued, by or on behalf of a creditor, against property of the bankrupt; and

                             (ii)  any moneys in court that have been paid into court, whether before or after the bankrupt became a bankrupt, in pursuance of proceedings instituted, by or on behalf of a creditor, to attach a debt due to the bankrupt;

as the case requires.

             (2)  Where property is, or the proceeds of the sale of property or other moneys are, required by subsection (1) to be delivered or paid to the trustee, the costs of the execution or attachment, as the case may be, are a first charge on that property or those proceeds of sale or other moneys, as the case may be.

             (3)  For the purpose of giving effect to the charge referred to in subsection (2), the sheriff, registrar or other officer of a court may retain on behalf of the creditor entitled to the benefit of the charge, such amount from the proceeds of sale or other moneys referred to in that subsection as he or she thinks necessary for the purpose.

             (4)  Where a sheriff, registrar or other officer of a court has, in pursuance of subsection (1), delivered property or paid moneys to the trustee, the creditor who issued the process of execution or instituted the attachment proceedings, or on whose behalf the process was issued or the proceedings instituted, as the case may be, may prove in the bankruptcy for his or her debt as an unsecured creditor as if the execution or attachment, as the case may be, had not taken place.

             (5)  Where:

                     (a)  a sheriff, registrar or other officer of a court has, in pursuance of subsection (1), delivered to the trustee property that was seized, or paid to the trustee the proceeds of the sale of property or other moneys that were received, as a result of the issue of execution against property of a bankrupt or the attachment of a debt due to a bankrupt; and

                     (b)  that property or debt would not have been property divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt if the bankrupt had become a bankrupt immediately before the execution was issued or the debt attached, as the case may be;

the trustee shall deliver that property, or pay those proceeds or other moneys, as the case requires, to the bankrupt or to a person authorized by the bankrupt in writing for the purpose.

             (6)  Where:

                     (a)  property has been delivered by a sheriff, or the proceeds of the sale of property or other moneys have been paid by a sheriff, registrar or other officer of a court, to the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt in pursuance of subsection (1); and

                     (b)  the property was in the possession of the sheriff, or the proceeds of the sale of the property or the other moneys were in the possession of the sheriff or paid into court, as the case may be, under or in pursuance of a process of execution issued, or proceedings to attach a debt instituted, by or on behalf of a creditor in respect of a liability of the bankrupt under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order (whether entered into or made, as the case may be, before or after the commencement of this section);

the trustee shall deliver that property, or pay those proceeds or other moneys, as the case requires, to that creditor.

             (7)  A failure by a sheriff to comply with a provision of this section does not affect the title of a person who purchases property of a bankrupt in good faith under a sale by the sheriff in pursuance of a process of execution issued by or on behalf of a creditor.

                     (b)  the transferor’s main purpose in making the transfer was:

Note:          For the application of this section where consideration is given to a third party rather than the transferor, see section 121A.

Showing the transferor’s main purpose in making a transfer

Exemption of transfers of property under debt agreements

             (7)  This section does not apply to a transfer of property under a debt agreement.

Protection of successors in title

                     (b)  the transferee gives some or all of the consideration for the transfer to a person (a **_third party_**) other than the transferor.

             (2)  Sections 120 and 121 apply as if the giving of the consideration to the third party were a transfer by the transferor of the property constituting the consideration.

             (3)  If the giving of the consideration to the third party is void against the trustee in the transferor’s bankruptcy under section 120 or 121, the trustee has the same rights to recover the property constituting the consideration as the trustee would have if the giving of the consideration had actually been a transfer by the transferor of the property constituting the consideration.

##### <a id="122"></a>122  Avoidance of preferences [_see_ Table B]

             (1)  A transfer of property by a person who is insolvent (the **_debtor_**) in favour of a creditor is void against the trustee in the debtor’s bankruptcy if the transfer:

                     (a)  had the effect of giving the creditor a preference, priority or advantage over other creditors; and

                     (b)  was made in the period that relates to the debtor, as indicated in the following table.

          (1A)  Subsection (1) applies in relation to a transfer of property by the debtor in favour of a creditor:

                     (b)  whether or not the property transferred is the debtor’s own property or is the property of the debtor and one or more other persons.

             (2)  Nothing in this section affects:

                     (a)  the rights of a purchaser, payee or encumbrancer in the ordinary course of business who acted in good faith and who gave consideration at least as valuable as the market value of the property; or

                     (b)  the rights of a person who is making title through or under a creditor of the debtor in good faith and who gave consideration at least as valuable as the market value of the property; or

                     (b)  a payment of tax, or of any other amount payable to the Commonwealth, or to the Commissioner of Taxation, under or because of an Act of which the Commissioner has the general administration, is taken to be made for consideration equal in value to the payment and in the ordinary course of business; and

                     (c)  a creditor shall be deemed not to be a purchaser, payee or encumbrancer in good faith if the transfer of property was made under such circumstances as to lead to the inference that the creditor knew, or had reason to suspect:

                              (i)  that the debtor was unable to pay his or her debts as they became due from his or her own money; and

                             (ii)  that the effect of the transfer would be to give him or her a preference, priority or advantage over other creditors.

          (4A)  A reference in this section (other than subsection (5)) to a creditor of the debtor shall be read as including a reference to a person who would be a creditor of the debtor in relation to a contract, agreement, transaction or other dealing if the contract, agreement, transaction or other dealing were not, in whole or in part, void or unenforceable, or had not been voided in whole or in part, by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth.

             (5)  If a transfer of property is set aside by the trustee in a bankruptcy as a result of this section, the creditor to whom the property was transferred may prove in the bankruptcy as if the transfer had not been made.

                     (c)  the **_market value_** of property transferred is its market value at the time of the transfer.

##### <a id="123"></a>123  Protection of certain transfers of property against relation back etc. [_see_ Table B]

                     (b)  a conveyance, transfer or assignment by the debtor for market value;

                     (c)  a contract, dealing or other transaction by or with the debtor for market value; or

             (2)  The burden of proving the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(e), (f) and (g) in relation to a transaction lies upon the person who relies on the validity of the transaction.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a transaction shall not be deemed not to have been in good faith and in the ordinary course of business by reason only that, at the time of the transaction, the person, other than the debtor, with whom it took place had notice of the commission of an act of bankruptcy by the debtor.

             (4)  Nothing in this Act invalidates a payment by a debtor, on or before the date on which he or she became a bankrupt, of, or in respect of, a penalty or fine imposed on him or her by a court in respect of an offence against a law, whether a law of the Commonwealth or not.

             (6)  Subject to sections 121, 128B and 128C, nothing in this Act invalidates, in any case where a debtor becomes a bankrupt, a conveyance, transfer, charge, disposition, assignment, payment or obligation executed, made or incurred by the debtor, before the day on which the debtor became a bankrupt, under or in pursuance of a maintenance agreement or maintenance order.

##### <a id="128B"></a>128B  Superannuation contributions made to defeat creditors—contributor is a person who later becomes a bankrupt

Transfers that are void

             (1)  A transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt (the **_transferor_**) to another person (the **_transferee_**) is void against the trustee in the transferor’s bankruptcy if:

                     (a)  the transfer is made by way of a contribution to an eligible superannuation plan; and

                     (b)  the property would probably have become part of the transferor’s estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the property had not been transferred; and

                     (c)  the transferor’s main purpose in making the transfer was:

                              (i)  to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferor’s creditors; or

                             (ii)  to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division among the transferor’s creditors; and

                     (d)  the transfer occurs on or after 28 July 2006.

Showing the transferor’s main purpose in making a transfer

             (2)  The transferor’s main purpose in making the transfer is taken to be the purpose described in paragraph (1)(c) if it can reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances that, at the time of the transfer, the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent.

             (3)  In determining whether the transferor’s main purpose in making the transfer was the purpose described in paragraph (1)(c), regard must be had to:

                     (a)  whether, during any period ending before the transfer, the transferor had established a pattern of making contributions to one or more eligible superannuation plans; and

                     (b)  if so, whether the transfer, when considered in the light of that pattern, is out of character.

Other ways of showing the transferor’s main purpose in making a transfer

             (4)  Subsections (2) and (3) do not limit the ways of establishing the transferor’s main purpose in making a transfer.

Rebuttable presumption of insolvency

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, a rebuttable presumption arises that the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent at the time of the transfer if it is established that the transferor:

                     (a)  had not, in respect of that time, kept such books, accounts and records as are usual and proper in relation to the business carried on by the transferor and as sufficiently disclose the transferor’s business transactions and financial position; or

                     (b)  having kept such books, accounts and records, has not preserved them.

Refund of contributions tax etc.

          (5A)  If:

                     (a)  as a result of subsection (1), a transfer made by way of a contribution to an eligible superannuation plan is void against the trustee in the transferor’s bankruptcy; and

                     (b)  any of the following amounts was debited from the contribution:

                              (i)  an amount in respect of tax in respect of the contribution;

                             (ii)  a fee, or a charge, in respect of the contribution; and

                     (c)  in compliance with a section 139ZQ notice that relates to the transfer, the trustee of the eligible superannuation plan pays an amount to the trustee in the transferor’s bankruptcy; and

                     (d)  the amount paid in compliance with the section 139ZQ notice exceeds the amount so debited;

the trustee in the transferor’s bankruptcy must pay to the trustee of the eligible superannuation plan an amount equal to the amount so debited.

                     (c)  the transferor did so under a scheme to which the beneficiary was a party; and

                     (d)  the property would probably have become part of the beneficiary’s estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the property had not been transferred; and

             (5)  For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a), disregard a benefit that is payable in the event of the death of a person.

### Division 4—Realization of property

##### <a id="129"></a>129  Trustee to take possession of property of bankrupt

             (1)  The trustee shall forthwith take possession of all the property of the bankrupt capable of manual delivery, including all deeds, books and documents of the bankrupt.

             (2)  The Court may, on the application of the trustee, enforce possession accordingly.

             (3)  A person is not entitled, as against the trustee, to withhold possession of the books of account or any papers or documents of the bankrupt relating to the accounts or to any of the examinable affairs of the bankrupt or to claim any lien on any such papers or documents.

             (4)  If a person has in his or her possession or power any moneys or security that he or she is not by law entitled to retain as against the bankrupt or the trustee, he or she shall pay or deliver the moneys or security to the trustee.

          (4A)  Where:

                     (a)  moneys are payable to a person under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth;

                     (b)  that person is a bankrupt or the moneys are payable to the person as the legal personal representative of a person who was at the time of his or her death a bankrupt; and

                     (c)  the moneys constitute property divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt or the deceased bankrupt, as the case may be;

those moneys shall, upon demand by the trustee, be paid to the trustee notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in that law.

          (4B)  A demand under subsection (4A) shall be in accordance with the approved form.

          (4C)  A payment made in pursuance of a demand under subsection (4A) is, to the extent of the amount paid, a valid discharge to the person making the payment as against the bankrupt or the estate of the deceased bankrupt, as the case may be.

             (5)  A person who does not pay or deliver to the trustee any moneys or security that he or she is required by subsection (4) or (4A) so to pay or deliver is guilty of contempt of court.

             (6)  If the person so failing to pay or deliver any moneys or security is a corporation, both the corporation and each officer of the corporation who is responsible for the non-compliance are guilty of contempt of court.

##### <a id="129AA"></a>129AA  Time limit for realising property

             (1)  This section applies only to:

                     (a)  property (other than cash) that was disclosed in the bankrupt’s statement of affairs; and

                     (b)  after-acquired property (other than cash) that the bankrupt discloses in writing to the trustee within 14 days after the bankrupt becomes aware that the property devolved on, or was acquired by, the bankrupt.

In this subsection, **_cash_** includes amounts standing to the credit of a bank account or similar account.

             (2)  If any such property is still vested in the trustee immediately before the revesting time, then it becomes vested in the bankrupt at the revesting time by force of this section.

             (3)  Initially, the **_revesting time_** for property is:

                     (a)  for property disclosed in the statement of affairs—the beginning of the day that is the sixth anniversary of the day on which the bankrupt is discharged from the bankruptcy; and

                     (b)  for after-acquired property that is disclosed before the bankrupt is discharged from the bankruptcy—the beginning of the day that is the sixth anniversary of the day on which the bankrupt is discharged; and

                     (c)  for after-acquired property that is disclosed after the bankrupt is discharged from the bankruptcy—the beginning of the day that is the sixth anniversary of the day on which the bankrupt disclosed the property to the trustee.

             (4)  If the trustee, before the current revesting time, gives the bankrupt a written notice (an **_extension notice_**) stating that a later revesting time applies to particular property, then that later time becomes the **_revesting time_** for that property.

             (5)  There is no limit on the number of extension notices that the trustee may give (either generally or in relation to particular property).

             (6)  The time specified in an extension notice must be either:

                     (a)  a specified time that is not more than 3 years after the current revesting time; or

                     (b)  a time that is reckoned by reference to a specified event (for example, the death of a life tenant), but is not more than 3 years after the happening of that event.

             (7)  Any property that becomes vested in the bankrupt under this section thereupon ceases to be subject to section 127.

##### <a id="129A"></a>129A  Eligible judges

             (1)  A judge of the Court may, by writing, consent to be declared by the Minister under subsection (2).

             (2)  The Minister may, by writing, declare a judge of the Court whose consent is in force under subsection (1) to be an eligible judge for the purposes of this Act.

             (3)  An eligible judge has, in relation to the power to issue a warrant under section 130, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court has in relation to proceedings in the High Court.

##### <a id="130"></a>130  Warrant for seizure of property connected with the bankrupt

             (1)  The trustee of a bankrupt’s estate may apply to an eligible judge for the issue of a warrant under subsection (2) if the trustee has reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is on or in any premises property (in this section called **_relevant property_**), being:

                     (a)  any of the property of the bankrupt;

                     (b)  property that may be connected with, or related to, the bankrupt’s examinable affairs; or

                     (c)  books (including books of an associated entity of the bankrupt) relevant to any of the bankrupt’s examinable affairs.

             (2)  On an application under subsection (1), the judge may issue a warrant authorising a constable, together with any other person named in the warrant:

                     (a)  to enter on or into the premises, using such force as is necessary for the purpose and is reasonable in the circumstances;

                     (b)  to search the premises for relevant property;

                     (c)  to break open, and search for relevant property, any cupboard, drawer, chest, trunk, box, package or other receptacle, whether a fixture or not, on or in the premises;

                     (d)  to take possession of, or secure against interference, any relevant property found on or in the premises; and

                     (e)  to deliver to the trustee, or to a person authorised in writing by the trustee for the purpose, any property of which possession is taken under the warrant.

             (3)  An eligible judge shall not issue a warrant under subsection (2) unless:

                     (a)  an affidavit has been furnished to the judge setting out the grounds on which the issue of the warrant is sought;

                     (b)  the applicant for the warrant (or some other person) has given to the judge, either orally or by affidavit, such further information (if any) as the judge requires concerning the grounds on which the issue of the warrant is sought; and

                     (c)  the judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for issuing the warrant.

             (4)  Where an eligible judge issues a warrant under subsection (2), he or she shall set out on the affidavit furnished in accordance with subsection (3):

                     (a)  on which of the grounds specified in the affidavit; and

                     (b)  on which other grounds (if any);

he or she has relied to justify the issue of the warrant.

             (5)  A warrant under this section shall:

                     (a)  state whether entry is authorised to be made at any time of the day or night or during specified hours of the day or night; and

                     (b)  specify a day, not later than 7 days after the day of issue of the warrant, on which the warrant ceases to have effect.

             (6)  Where, under this section, a person takes possession of property, or secures property against interference, a person is not entitled, as against the trustee, to claim a lien on the property, but such a lien is not otherwise prejudiced.

             (7)  Where, under this section, a person takes possession of books, or secures books against interference, that person or any other person to whom the books are delivered under paragraph (2)(e):

                     (a)  may make copies of, or take extracts from, the books;

                     (b)  may require a person who was a party to the compilation of the books to explain to the best of the person’s knowledge and belief any matter about the compilation of the books or to which the books relate;

                     (c)  may retain possession of the books for such period as is necessary to enable the books to be inspected, and copies of, or extracts from, the books to be made or taken, by or on behalf of the trustee; and

                     (d)  during that period shall permit a person who would be entitled to inspect any one or more of those books if they were not in the possession of the first-mentioned person or the other person to inspect at all reasonable times such of those books as that person would be so entitled to inspect.

             (8)  The powers conferred by this section are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other powers conferred by law.

##### <a id="132"></a>132  Vesting and transfer of property

             (1)  Subject to this section, and to section 158, where a trustee is appointed by the creditors, the property of the bankrupt passes to and vests in the trustee so appointed on the day on which the appointment takes effect.

             (2)  Subject to this section, the property of the bankrupt passes from trustee to trustee and vests in the trustee for the time being during his or her continuance in office or, if the Official Trustee becomes the trustee, in the Official Trustee, without any conveyance, assignment or transfer.

             (3)  Where a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth requires the transmission of property to be registered, and enables the trustee to be registered as the owner of any such property that is part of the property of the bankrupt, that property, notwithstanding that it vests in equity in the trustee by virtue of this section, does not vest in the trustee at law until the requirements of that law have been complied with.

##### <a id="133"></a>133  Disclaimer of onerous property [_see_ Table B]

       (1AA)  Where any part of the property of the bankrupt consists of:

                     (a)  land of any tenure burdened with onerous covenants; or

                     (b)  property (including land) that is unsaleable or is not readily saleable;

subsection (1) applies.

        (1AB)  Where:

                     (a)  any part of the property of the bankrupt consists of property, being neither land nor an interest in land; and

                     (b)  it may reasonably be expected that the costs, charges and expenses that the trustee would incur in realising the property would exceed the proceeds of realising the property;

subsection (1) applies.

             (1)  Subject to this section, the trustee may, notwithstanding that he or she has endeavoured to sell or has taken possession of the property or exercised any act of ownership in relation to it and notwithstanding, in the case of property the transfer of which is required by a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth to be registered, that he or she has not become the registered owner of that property, by writing signed by him or her, at any time disclaim the property.

          (1A)  Subject to this section, the trustee may at any time, by writing signed by him or her, disclaim any contract that forms part of the property of the bankrupt whether or not the trustee has endeavoured to assign the property or exercised any rights in relation to it.

             (2)  A disclaimer under subsection (1) or (1A) operates to determine forthwith the rights, interests and liabilities of the bankrupt and his or her property in or in respect of the property disclaimed, and discharges the trustee from all personal liability in respect of the property disclaimed as from the date when the property vested in him or her, but does not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the bankrupt and his or her property and the trustee from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

##### <a id="139M"></a>139M  Derivation of income

             (1)  Income is taken to be derived by a bankrupt for the purposes of this Division even though it is not actually received by the bankrupt because:

                     (a)  an amount is deducted from it, or it is wholly or partly otherwise applied, under a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory; or

                     (b)  it is reinvested, accumulated or capitalised; or

                     (c)  it is dealt with on behalf of the bankrupt or as the bankrupt directs.

                              (i)  any amount that the bankrupt pays or is likely to be liable to pay, or paid or was liable to pay, as the case may be, during that period in respect of income tax (but not including any amount that is in respect of a provable debt); and

                            (iii)  if the bankrupt pays or is likely to be liable to pay, or paid or was liable to pay, as the case may be, during that period an amount for the support of a child pursuant to a maintenance agreement entered into under the _Family Law Act 1975_ or under a maintenance order—so much of that amount as does not exceed the maximum amount that, but for that agreement or order, the bankrupt could be, or could have been, liable to pay during that period in respect of child support under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_; and

                     (b)  is taken to be increased by any amount that the bankrupt receives or is likely to receive, or received or was entitled to receive, as the case may be, during that period as a refund of income tax.

             (2)  A refund is not taken into account under paragraph (1)(b) if it relates to a year of income that ended before the date of the bankruptcy.

             (3)  If a refund relates to a year of income that commenced before, but ended after, the date of the bankruptcy, then it is taken into account under paragraph (1)(b) only to the extent that the refund is attributable to the part of the year of income after the date of bankruptcy. For this purpose, the refund is apportioned on a time basis.

#### Subdivision D—Liability of bankrupt to pay contributions

##### <a id="139P"></a>139P  Liability of bankrupt to pay contribution

             (1)  Subject to section 139Q, if the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive during a contribution assessment period as assessed by the trustee under an original assessment exceeds the actual income threshold amount applicable in relation to the bankrupt when that assessment is made, the bankrupt is liable to pay to the trustee a contribution in respect of that period.

             (2)  Subject to section 139Q, if the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive during a contribution assessment period as assessed by the trustee under an original assessment does not exceed the actual income threshold amount applicable in relation to the bankrupt when that assessment is made, the bankrupt is not liable to, but may if he or she so wishes, pay to the trustee a contribution in respect of that period.

##### <a id="139Q"></a>139Q  Change in liability of bankrupt

             (1)  If the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive, or derived, during a contribution assessment period as assessed by the trustee under a subsequent assessment exceeds the actual income threshold amount applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the subsequent assessment is made, the bankrupt is liable to pay to the trustee a contribution in respect of that period.

             (2)  The liability of the bankrupt under subsection (1) in respect of a contribution assessment period is in substitution for any liability of the bankrupt in respect of that period under subsection 139P(1) or under any previous application of subsection (1) of this section and has effect despite subsection 139P(2).

             (3)  If the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive, or derived, during a contribution assessment period as assessed by the trustee under a subsequent assessment does not exceed the actual income threshold amount applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the subsequent assessment is made:

                     (a)  the bankrupt is not liable to, but may if he or she so wishes, pay to the trustee a contribution in respect of that income; and

                     (b)  any liability that the bankrupt had under subsection 139P(1) or under subsection (1) of this section to pay a contribution in respect of that period is extinguished.

##### <a id="139R"></a>139R  Liability not affected by subsequent discharge

                   Any liability of a bankrupt under section 139P or 139Q is not affected by his or her discharge from bankruptcy after the making of the assessment that gave rise to the liability.

                   The contribution that a bankrupt is liable to pay in respect of a contribution assessment period is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00789/Html/Bankruptcy1966_WD02_image002.gif)

                    where:

                    <a name="assessed-incom"></a>**_Assessed income_** means the amount assessed by the trustee to be the income that the bankrupt is likely to derive, or derived, during the contribution assessment period.

                    <a name="actual-incom-threshold-amount"></a>**_Actual income threshold amount_** means the actual income threshold amount assessed by the trustee to be applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the assessment is made.

##### <a id="139T"></a>139T  Determination of higher income threshold in cases of hardship

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the trustee has made an assessment of a contribution that a bankrupt is liable to pay to the trustee for a contribution assessment period; and

                     (b)  the bankrupt considers that, if required to pay that contribution, he or she will suffer hardship for a reason or reasons set out in subsection (2);

the bankrupt may apply in writing to the trustee for the making of a determination under this section for that period.

             (2)  The reasons are as follows:

                     (a)  the bankrupt or a dependant of the bankrupt suffers from an illness or disability that requires on-going medical attention and the supply of medicines, and the bankrupt is required to meet a substantial proportion of the costs of that medical attention or those medicines from his or her income;

                     (b)  the bankrupt is required to make payments from his or her income to meet the cost of child day-care to enable the bankrupt to continue in employment or other work;

                     (c)  the bankrupt is living in rented accommodation that is not provided by:

                              (i)  the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                             (ii)  an authority of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

                            (iii)  a local government authority;

                            and the bankrupt is required to pay the cost of that accommodation wholly or mainly from his or her income;

                     (d)  the bankrupt incurs substantial expense in travelling to and from the bankrupt’s place of employment or other work, whether by public transport or otherwise;

                     (e)  the spouse of the bankrupt, or another person residing with the bankrupt, who ordinarily contributes to the costs of maintaining the bankrupt’s household has become unable to contribute to those costs because of unemployment, illness or injury;

                      (f)  any other reason prescribed by the regulations.

             (3)  The trustee must not make a determination under this section unless the bankrupt provides satisfactory evidence of the bankrupt’s income and expenses, and any other matters on which the bankrupt relies to establish the reasons for the application.

             (4)  The trustee must decide the application as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than 30 days, after the day on which the application is received.

             (5)  If the trustee does not make a decision on the application within that period of 30 days, the trustee is taken to have made a decision at the end of that period refusing the application.

             (6)  If the trustee is satisfied that the bankrupt will suffer hardship if required to pay the contribution, the trustee may determine that, for the purposes of the application of section 139S in relation to the bankrupt in respect of the contribution assessment period, the actual income threshold amount that was applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the assessment was made is taken to have been increased to such amount as the trustee determines.

             (7)  If the trustee is not satisfied that the bankrupt will suffer hardship if required to pay the contribution, the trustee must refuse the application.

             (8)  If the trustee makes a determination under subsection (6), the trustee must make such assessment under section 139W as is necessary to give effect to the determination.

             (9)  The trustee must give written notice to the bankrupt:

                     (a)  setting out the trustee’s decision on the application; and

                     (b)  referring to the evidence or other material on which the decision was based; and

                     (c)  giving the reasons for the decision.

           (10)  The notice must include a statement to the effect that the bankrupt may request the Inspector-General to review the decision.

           (11)  A contravention of subsection (10) in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision.

           (12)  The trustee’s decision under this section is reviewable under Subdivision G in the same way as an assessment made by the trustee.

#### Subdivision E—Provision of information to trustee

##### <a id="139U"></a>139U  Bankrupt to provide evidence of income

             (1)  A bankrupt must, as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than 21 days, after the end of a contribution assessment period, give to the trustee:

             (3)  Without limiting the generality of paragraph (1)(b), the books that a bankrupt is required to give to the trustee under that paragraph in respect of a contribution assessment period include:

                     (a)  if the bankrupt received from his or her employer one or more pay slips or other documents evidencing salary or wages paid to him or her by that employer during that period—that document or each of those documents; and

                     (b)  any copy of a group certificate or payment summary (within the meaning of section 16-170 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) in the possession of the bankrupt that relates in whole or in part to that period; and

                     (c)  any statement provided to the bankrupt by an ADI or other financial institution that shows periodic payments made during that period to an account kept by the bankrupt (either alone or jointly with any other person) with that institution; and

                     (d)  any notice of assessment issued to the bankrupt under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in respect of a year of income in which that period is included; and

                     (e)  if the bankrupt is in receipt of a pension, allowance or other benefit under a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory—any letter or other document sent or given to the bankrupt by the Department or authority that administers the legislation or scheme under which the benefit is provided.

##### <a id="139V"></a>139V  Power of trustee to require bankrupt to provide additional evidence

                   If the trustee has reasonable grounds to suspect that:

                     (a)  any particulars set out in the statement given by the bankrupt under subsection 139U(1) are false or misleading in a material respect; or

                     (b)  any material particulars have been omitted from that statement;

then, for the purpose of enabling the trustee to decide whether the particulars set out in the statement are correct, the trustee, by written notice given to the bankrupt, may require the bankrupt to give to the trustee within a specified period of not less than 14 days such information or books as are specified in the notice.

#### Subdivision F—Assessments of income and contribution

##### <a id="139W"></a>139W  Assessment of bankrupt’s income and contribution

             (1)  As soon as practicable after the start of each contribution assessment period in relation to a bankrupt, the trustee is to make an assessment of the income that is likely to be derived, or was derived, by the bankrupt during that period, of the actual income threshold amount that is applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the assessment is made and of the contribution (if any) that the bankrupt is liable to pay in respect of that period under section 139S.

             (2)  If at any time, whether during or after a contribution assessment period, any one or more of the following paragraphs applies or apply:

                     (a)  the trustee is satisfied that the income that is likely to be derived, or was derived, by the bankrupt during that period is or was greater or less than the amount of that income as assessed by the last preceding assessment in respect of that period;

                     (b)  the base income threshold amount increased or decreased after the making of the last preceding assessment in respect of that period and before the end of that period;

                     (c)  the trustee is satisfied that the number of the bankrupt’s dependants increased or decreased after the making of the last preceding assessment and before the end of that period;

the trustee is to make a fresh assessment of the income that is likely to be derived, or was derived, by the bankrupt during that period, of the actual income threshold amount that is applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the assessment is made and of the contribution (if any) that the bankrupt is liable to pay in respect of that period.

             (3)  The powers of the trustee under subsection (2) may be exercised on the trustee’s own initiative or at the bankrupt’s request, but the trustee is not required to consider whether to exercise those powers at the bankrupt’s request unless the bankrupt satisfies the trustee that there are reasonable grounds for the trustee to do so.

             (4)  As soon as practicable after the making of an assessment the trustee must give to the bankrupt written notice setting out particulars of the assessment and informing the bankrupt about the possibility of a variation under section 139T.

##### <a id="139WA"></a>139WA  No time limit on making assessment

             (1)  An assessment under section 139W (including a fresh assessment referred to in subsection 139W(2)) for a contribution assessment period may be made at any time, including:

                     (a)  a time after the end of the contribution assessment period; or

                     (b)  a time after the bankrupt is discharged.

             (2)  For the purpose of applying subsection (1), a reference in this Division to a bankrupt includes a reference to a former bankrupt.

##### <a id="139X"></a>139X  Basis of assessments

             (1)  In making an assessment of the income that is likely to be derived, or was derived, by a bankrupt during a contribution assessment period the trustee may have regard to any information provided by the bankrupt or any other information in the trustee’s possession.

             (2)  If the trustee considers that any information provided by the bankrupt is or may be incorrect, the trustee may disregard that information and may make an assessment on the basis of what the trustee considers to be the correct information.

##### <a id="139Y"></a>139Y  Trustee may regard bankrupt as receiving reasonable remuneration

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the bankrupt is engaging or has engaged during a contribution assessment period in employment or other work or in activities that resemble employment or other work; and

                     (b)  the bankrupt does not receive or did not receive any remuneration in respect of the employment, work or activities or receives or received remuneration that is less than the remuneration (in this subsection called the **_reasonable remuneration_**) that:

                              (i)  in the case of employment where an industrial instrument prescribes rates or minimum rates of salary or wages for the employment—might reasonably be expected to be or to have been received by the bankrupt in respect of the employment by virtue of the industrial instrument; or

                             (ii)  in any other case—might reasonably be expected to be or to have been received by a person who engaged in similar employment, work or activities where there was no relationship or other connection between that person and the person for whom the employment, work or activities were carried out;

then, for the purpose of making an assessment, the trustee may determine that the bankrupt receives or received the reasonable remuneration in respect of the employment, work or activities.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the bankrupt enters or entered during a contribution assessment period into any transaction that might reasonably be expected to produce or to have produced income; and

                     (b)  the bankrupt does not derive or did not derive any income from the transaction or derives or derived income that is less than the income (in this subsection called the **_reasonable income_**) that might reasonably be expected to be or to have been derived if the transaction were or had been entered into at arm’s length;

then, for the purpose of making an assessment, the trustee may determine that the bankrupt derives or derived the reasonable income from the transaction.

##### <a id="139Z"></a>139Z  If bankrupt claims not to be in receipt of income

             (1)  If a bankrupt:

                     (a)  does not provide information about whether he or she is likely to derive, or derived, income or a particular class of income during a contribution assessment period; or

                     (b)  claims not to be likely to derive, or not to have derived, any income or a particular class of income during a contribution assessment period;

but the trustee has reasonable grounds for believing that the bankrupt is likely to derive, or derived, income, or income of that class, during that period, then, for the purpose of making an assessment, the trustee may determine that the bankrupt is likely to derive, or derived, income, or income of that class, during that period and may also determine the amount of that income.

             (2)  Without limiting the matters that a trustee may take into account for the purpose of making an assessment as mentioned in subsection (1) in respect of a contribution assessment period, the trustee may have regard to any employment or other work or other income-producing activities that were engaged in by the bankrupt before that period and may determine whether the bankrupt is likely to engage, or to have engaged, in similar employment, work or other income-producing activities during that period. 

#### Subdivision G—Review of assessment

             (1)  The Inspector-General may review a decision of a trustee to make an assessment:

             (3)  A charge under subsection (1) does not have priority over a mortgage, lien, charge or other encumbrance in favour of an associated entity of the bankrupt if that entity satisfies the Court that that mortgage, lien, charge or other encumbrance arose from a transaction that was entered into at arm’s length and for valuable and adequate consideration provided by that entity.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 6 months.

##### <a id="153"></a>153  Effect of discharge

             (1)  Subject to this section, where a bankrupt is discharged from a bankruptcy, the discharge operates to release him or her from all debts (including secured debts) provable in the bankruptcy, whether or not, in the case of a secured debt, the secured creditor has surrendered his or her security for the benefit of creditors generally.

Note:          The operation of this section in relation to accumulated HEC debts and semester debts under the _Higher Education Funding Act 1988_ is affected by section 106YA of that Act.

             (2)  The discharge of a bankrupt from a bankruptcy does not:

                     (a)  release the bankrupt from:

                              (i)  a debt on a recognizance; or

                             (ii)  a debt with which the bankrupt is chargeable at the suit of the sheriff or other public officer on a bail bond entered into for the appearance of a person prosecuted for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth; or

                     (b)  release the bankrupt from a debt incurred by means of fraud or a fraudulent breach of trust to which he or she was a party or a debt of which he or she has obtained forbearance by fraud; or

                     (c)  subject to any order of the Court made under subsection (2A), release the bankrupt from any liability under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order;

Note:          A discharged bankrupt remains liable under any pecuniary penalty order because such liabilities are not provable in bankruptcy, see subsection 82(3A).

          (2A)  The Court may order that the discharge of a bankrupt from bankruptcy shall operate to release the bankrupt, to such extent and subject to such conditions as the Court thinks fit, from liability to pay arrears due under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order.

             (3)  The discharge of a bankrupt from a bankruptcy does not affect the right of a secured creditor, or any person claiming through or under him or her, to realize or otherwise deal with his or her security:

                     (a)  if the secured creditor has not proved in the bankruptcy for any part of the secured debt—for the purpose of obtaining payment of the secured debt; or

                     (b)  if the secured creditor has proved in the bankruptcy for part of the secured debt—for the purpose of obtaining payment of the part of the secured debt for which he or she has not proved in the bankruptcy;

and, for the purposes of enabling the secured creditor or a person claiming through or under him or her so to realize or deal with his or her security, but not otherwise, the secured debt, or the part of the secured debt, as the case may be, shall be deemed not to have been released by the discharge of the bankrupt.

             (4)  The discharge of a bankrupt from a bankruptcy does not release from any liability a person who, at the date on which the bankrupt became a bankrupt:

                     (a)  was a partner or a co-trustee with the bankrupt or was jointly bound or had made a joint contract with the bankrupt; or

                     (b)  was surety or in the nature of a surety for the bankrupt.

### Division 5—Annulment of bankruptcy

##### <a id="153A"></a>153A  Annulment on payment of debts

             (1)  If the trustee is satisfied that all the bankrupt’s debts have been paid in full, the bankruptcy is annulled, by force of this subsection, on the date on which the last such payment was made.

          (1A)  In determining whether there has been full payment of a debt that bears interest, the interest must be reckoned up to and including the date on which the debt (including interest) is paid.

             (2)  The trustee must, before the end of the period of 2 days beginning on that date, give to the Official Receiver a written certificate setting out the former bankrupt’s name and bankruptcy number and the date of the annulment.

                    Penalty:  5 penalty units.

Note:          See also section 277B (about infringement notices).

             (3)  Subsection (2) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, if a debt has been proved by a creditor but the creditor cannot be found or cannot be identified, the debt may be paid to the Official Receiver and, if so paid, is taken for the purposes of this section to have been paid in full to the creditor.

          (4A)  Money received by the Official Receiver under subsection (4) is received on behalf of the Commonwealth.

             (5)  If money is paid to the Official Receiver under subsection (4), the provisions of subsections 254(3) and (4) apply in relation to that money as if it had been paid to the Commonwealth by a trustee under subsection 254(2).

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="bankrupt-debt"></a>**_bankrupt’s debts_** means all debts that have been proved in the bankruptcy and includes interest payable on such of those debts as bear interest, and the costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy, including the remuneration and expenses of the trustee.

##### <a id="153B"></a>153B  Annulment by Court

             (1)  If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made or, in the case of a debtor’s petition, that the petition ought not to have been presented or ought not to have been accepted by the Official Receiver, the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy.

             (2)  In the case of a debtor’s petition, the order may be made whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when the petition was presented.

             (3)  The trustee must, before the end of the period of 2 days beginning on the day the trustee becomes aware of the order, give to the Official Receiver a written certificate setting out the former bankrupt’s name and bankruptcy number and the date of the annulment.

                    Penalty:  5 penalty units.

Note:          See also section 277B (about infringement notices).

             (4)  Subsection (3) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### <a id="154"></a>154  Effect of annulment

             (1)  If the bankruptcy of a person (in this section called the **_former bankrupt_**) is annulled under this Division:

                     (a)  all sales and dispositions of property and payments duly made, and all acts done, by the trustee or any person acting under the authority of the trustee or the Court before the annulment are taken to have been validly made or done; and

                     (b)  the trustee may apply the property of the former bankrupt still vested in the trustee in payment of the costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy, including the remuneration and expenses of the trustee; and

                     (c)  subject to subsections (3), (6) and (7), the remainder (if any) of the property of the former bankrupt still vested in the trustee reverts to the bankrupt.

             (2)  If the property of the former bankrupt referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is insufficient to meet the costs, charges and expenses referred to in that paragraph, the amount of the deficiency is a debt due by the former bankrupt to the trustee and is recoverable by the trustee by action against the former bankrupt in a court of competent jurisdiction.

             (3)  If an application is made to the Court by a person claiming an interest in property referred to in paragraph (1)(c), the Court, after hearing such persons as it thinks fit, may make an order, either unconditionally or on such conditions as the Court considers just and equitable, for the vesting of the property in, or delivery of the property to, a person in whom, or to whom, it seems to the Court to be just and equitable that it should be vested or delivered, or to a trustee for that person.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), if an order vesting property in a person is made under subsection (3), the property vests immediately in the person without any conveyance, transfer or assignment.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the property to which such an order relates is property the transfer of which is required by a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory to be registered; and

                     (b)  that law enables the registration of such an order;

the property, even though it vests in equity in the person named in the order, does not vest in that person at law until the requirements of that law have been complied with.

             (6)  The Court may make an order directing the trustee not to pay or transfer the property, or a specified part of the property, referred to in paragraph (1)(c) to the former bankrupt if:

                     (a)  the Director of Public Prosecutions, or a person who is entitled to apply for an interstate confiscation order under a corresponding law, applies to the Court for an order under this subsection; and

                     (b)  the Court is satisfied that:

                              (i)  proceedings are pending under a proceeds of crime law; and

                             (ii)  property of the former bankrupt may:

                                        (A)  become subject to a forfeiture order or interstate forfeiture order made in the proceedings; or

                                        (B)  be required to satisfy a pecuniary penalty order or interstate pecuniary penalty order made in the proceedings.

             (7)  The Court, on application made to it, may vary or revoke an order made under subsection (6).

## Part X—Personal insolvency agreements

### Division 1—Interpretation

##### <a id="187"></a>187  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="control-truste"></a>**_controlling trustee_**, in relation to a debtor whose property is subject to control under Division 2, means the person who is the controlling trustee under section 188 or 192.

                    <a name="debtor"></a>**_debtor_** means a person who is insolvent.

                    <a name="divis-properti"></a>**_divisible property_**, in relation to a personal insolvency agreement executed by a debtor, means the property, other than property that was acquired by, or devolved on, the debtor on or after the day on which he or she executed the agreement, that would be divisible amongst his or her creditors under Part VI if he or she had become a bankrupt on that day.

          (1A)  Without limiting the definition of **_debtor_** in subsection (1), a reference in this Part to a debtor shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be read as including a reference to a person who is for the time being insolvent, even if the person may ultimately cease to be insolvent.

             (2)  In this Part, a reference, in relation to a personal insolvency agreement, to a provable debt shall be read as a reference to a debt or liability that would have been a provable debt in the debtor’s bankruptcy if the debtor had become a bankrupt on the day on which he or she executed the personal insolvency agreement.

                    <a name="interest-charg"></a>**_interest charge_** means charge imposed by Part 2 of the Estate Charges Act.

                    <a name="late-payment-penalti"></a>**_late payment penalty_** means penalty payable under subsection 281(1).

                    <a name="realis-charg"></a>**_realisations charge_** means charge imposed by Part 3 of the Estate Charges Act.

##### <a id="279"></a>279  Administration of, and powers and functions in relation to, the Charges Acts

             (1)  The Inspector-General has the general administration of the Estate Charges Act.

             (2)  A reference to “this Act” in section 12 or 77AA of this Act is taken to include a reference to the Estate Charges Act.

##### <a id="280"></a>280  Deferred payment of interest charge or realisations charge

             (1)  A person may defer the payment of an amount of interest charge relating to a particular trustee account if:

                     (a)  the total amount of interest charge that the person is liable to pay in respect of the account is less than $50; and

                     (b)  the account has not been closed; and

                     (c)  the person has notified the Inspector-General as provided for in subsection (3).

             (2)  A person may defer the payment of an amount of realisations charge relating to a particular bankrupt’s estate, deceased person’s estate or debtor’s property, as the case may be, if:

                     (a)  the total amount of realisations charge that the person is liable to pay in respect of the estate or property is less than $50; and

                     (c)  the person has notified the Inspector-General as provided for in subsection (3).

             (3)  If a person intends to defer paying an amount of interest charge or realisations charge, he or she must notify the Inspector-General in writing of that fact before the time by which the amount is otherwise required to be paid.

             (4)  If a person defers payment of an amount of interest charge or realisations charge in accordance with this section, the amount is still payable to the Commonwealth, but the person does not have to pay it until 21 days after whichever of the following happens first:

                     (a)  at the end of a charge period:

                              (i)  if the deferral is of interest charge—the total amount of interest charge that the person is liable to pay in respect of the relevant trustee account is $50 or more; or

                     (b)  the relevant trustee account is closed.

Note:          As a deferred amount is still payable to the Commonwealth, it must be taken into account in working out the total amounts referred to in paragraphs (1)(a), (2)(a) and (4)(a).

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="truste-account"></a>**_trustee account_** means an account under section 169, or under that section as applied by any of the following provisions:

##### <a id="281"></a>281  Late payment penalty—interest charge and realisations charge

             (1)  If any interest charge or realisations charge remains unpaid after the time for payment of the charge, the person liable to pay the charge is liable to pay to the Commonwealth a late payment penalty calculated from that time at the rate of 20% per year on the amount unpaid.

             (2)  The person liable to pay late payment penalty is personally liable to pay the penalty and is not entitled to be reimbursed in respect of the penalty out of the bankrupt’s estate, the deceased person’s estate or the debtor’s property, as the case may be.

##### <a id="282"></a>282  Extension of time for payment—interest charge and realisations charge

                     (d)  application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a decision to refuse an application, or to grant a lesser extension than was applied for.

Note:          Section 27A of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires notification of a decision that is reviewable.

##### <a id="283"></a>283  Remission of interest charge, realisations charge and late payment penalty

             (1)  The Inspector-General may remit an amount of interest charge, realisations charge or late payment penalty that is payable but has not been paid if the Inspector-General thinks that:

                     (b)  it is appropriate to remit the amount.

             (2)  The following provisions apply in relation to remissions under subsection (1):

                     (a)  the person liable to pay the charge or penalty may apply for a remission;

             (1)  If a person gives the Commonwealth a cheque or payment order in payment of an amount of interest charge, realisations charge or late payment penalty, the amount is taken not to be paid until the cheque or payment order is paid by the institution on which it is drawn.

             (2)  If:

                     (b)  the cheque or payment order is paid by the institution on which it is drawn;

then, for the purposes of working out if there is a liability to late payment penalty, the amount of charge is taken to have been paid when the person gave the cheque to the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="286"></a>286  Regulations may deal with other matters

             (1)  The regulations may include other provisions dealing with the collection and recovery of interest charge, realisations charge or late payment penalty, including (but not limited to) provisions dealing with the following:
