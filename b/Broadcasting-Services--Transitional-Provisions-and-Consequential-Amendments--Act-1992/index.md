##### <a id="11"></a>11  Applications for renewal not dealt with under the Broadcasting Act

                     (a)  before the commencement of this Act, the holder of a former licence to which subsection 5(1) applies had made an application for renewal of the former licence in accordance with the Broadcasting Act; and

                     (c)  the application was pending immediately before that commencement;

                     (c)  the repeal effected by section 28 had not been made; and

                     (d)  references in the Broadcasting Act to the Tribunal were references to the ABA.

             (4)  If a commercial radio licence, a public radio licence, a supplementary radio licence or a remote licence is granted in respect of an application referred to in subsection (1), subsection 5(1) applies in relation to that licence as if the licence had been granted under section 81 of the Broadcasting Act and was in force immediately before the commencement of this Act.

             (5)  The ABA must not allocate a licence under section 39 of the new Act in respect of a licence area (the **_base licence area_**) until it has, under subsection (1) of this section, finally dealt with any application for the grant of a commercial radio licence in respect of a service area that would, if the application had been made under the new Act, be a licence area that is the same as the base licence area because of subsection 39(4) of the new Act.

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), an application is taken to be finally dealt with if:

                     (a)  a licence has been granted in respect of the application; or
