**

 <dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Where a simple signature on a blank stamped paper stamped with an impress

duty stamp is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a

bill, it operates as a _prima facie_ authority to fill it up as a complete

bill for any amount the stamp will cover, using the signature for that of the

drawer or the acceptor or an indorser.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>And in like manner when a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has a _prima facie_ authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given. Reasonable time for this purpose is a question of fact: </dd> </dl></dl>

Provided that, if any such instrument after completion is negotiated to a holder in due course, it shall be valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up within a reasonable time and strictly in accordance with the authority given.

not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.

</dd>

But if the bill be in the hands of a holder in due course, a valid delivery of the bill by all parties prior to him, so as to make them liable to him, is conclusively presumed.
