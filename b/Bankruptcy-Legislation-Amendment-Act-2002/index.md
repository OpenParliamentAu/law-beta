                     (a)  the bankrupt or a dependant of the bankrupt suffers from an illness or disability that requires on-going medical attention and the supply of medicines, and the bankrupt is required to meet a substantial proportion of the costs of that medical attention or those medicines from his or her income;

             (5)  If the trustee does not make a decision on the application within that period of 30 days, the trustee is taken to have made a decision at the end of that period refusing the application.

             (6)  If the trustee is satisfied that the bankrupt will suffer hardship if required to pay the contribution, the trustee may determine that, for the purposes of the application of section 139S in relation to the bankrupt in respect of the contribution assessment period, the actual income threshold amount that was applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the assessment was made is taken to have been increased to such amount as the trustee determines.

             (7)  If the trustee is not satisfied that the bankrupt will suffer hardship if required to pay the contribution, the trustee must refuse the application.

             (8)  If the trustee makes a determination under subsection (6), the trustee must make such assessment under section 139W as is necessary to give effect to the determination.

             (9)  The trustee must give written notice to the bankrupt:
