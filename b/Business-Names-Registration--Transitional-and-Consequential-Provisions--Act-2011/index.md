(3)       The notification must:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  where a business is carried on, or is intended to be carried on, under the business name by a person alone—give details of that person; or

                             (ii)  where a business is carried on, or is intended to be carried on, under the business name by a group of persons—give details of each of those persons; and

                     (b)  nominate the period for which the business name is to be registered.

## 7  Registration

(1)       ASIC must register the business name:

                     (a)  in a case where a business is carried on, or is intended to be carried on, under the business name by a person alone—to the person; or

                     (b)  in a case where a business is carried on, or is intended to be carried on, under the business name by a group of persons:

                              (i)  if the group of persons has formed an entity to do so—to the entity; or

                             (ii)  if the group of persons has not formed an entity to do so—to the group of persons.

(2)       If the business name is registered to a group of persons under subparagraph (1)(b)(ii):

                     (a)  each of those persons is a **_joint venture entity_** for the purposes of section 87 of the Business Names Registration Act; and

                     (b)  the group is a **_joint venture_** for the purposes of section 87 of the Business Names Registration Act.

_Note:       Section 87 of the Business Names Registration Act sets out rules for treating joint ventures in the same way as entities._

(3)       ASIC registers the business name by entering in the Business Names Register:

                     (a)  details sufficient to identify the entity or group of persons to whom the business name is registered, including (if ASIC has the information):

                              (i)  in a case where the business name is registered under paragraph (1)(a)—the person’s ABN; and

                             (ii)  in a case where the business name is registered under subparagraph (1)(b)(i)—the entity’s ABN; and

                            (iii)  in a case where the business name is registered under subparagraph (1)(b)(ii)—the ABN of each person within the group; and

                     (b)  the business name; and

                     (c)  the address of each principal place of business of which ASIC is aware; and

                     (d)  each address for service of documents of which ASIC is aware; and

                     (e)  the period for which the business name is registered.

(4)       The period for which the business name is registered is the period nominated by the State or Territory under paragraph 6(3)(b).

(5)       If a business name is registered as a result of a notice given under item 6 after the period of 4 months beginning on the change‑over day has elapsed, ASIC must notify the entity to whom the business name is registered (including a group of persons that is treated as an entity because it is a joint venture for the purposes of section 87 of the Business Names Registration Act) in writing of the registration.

(6)       This item does not apply if, because of:

                     (a)  a previous application of this item; or

                     (b)  another provision of this Act; or

                     (c)  a provision of the Business Names Registration Act;

the business name is already registered to the entity to whom it would be registered under this item (including a group of persons that is treated as an entity because it is a joint venture for the purposes of section 87 of the Business Names Registration Act).

## 8  ASIC must cease to hold name if given notice by all relevant States and Territories

(1)       If all of the States and Territories who have given ASIC notification under item 4 to hold a business name give ASIC notification in accordance with subitem (2) that ASIC is to cease to hold the business name, ASIC must cease to hold the business name.

(2)       The notification must be given in electronic form.

## 9  ASIC may request update on names held

(1)       ASIC may, by notice in accordance with subitem (2), request each State or Territory that has given ASIC notification under item 4 in relation to a business name to inform ASIC whether the business name should continue to be held for the purposes of resolving outstanding matters.

(2)       A notice under subitem (1):

                     (a)  must be given in electronic form; and

                     (b)  may be given no earlier than 3 months after the change‑over day.

(3)       The notice may nominate a period of no less than 28 days (beginning on the day on which the notice is given) within which the State or Territory should give the information to ASIC.

(4)       ASIC may cease to hold the business name if none of the States or Territories to whom notice is given under subitem (1) inform ASIC electronically within the nominated period for that State or Territory that ASIC is to continue to hold the business name.

(5)       To avoid doubt, ASIC may exercise its powers in relation to a business name under this item more than once.

(6)       If ASIC ceases to hold a business name, it must notify the State or Territory of that fact.

## 10  Regulations for the purposes of resolving outstanding matters

(1)       The Governor‑General may make regulations to deal with business names in relation to which outstanding matters under the law of a State or Territory are to be resolved.

(2)       To avoid doubt, regulations made under subitem (1) must not direct a State or Territory on how outstanding matters are to be resolved.

(3)       Without limiting subitem (1), this Act and the Business Names Registration Act have effect subject to any modifications made by the regulations to deal with business names in relation to which outstanding matters under the law of a State or Territory are to be resolved.

(4)       In this item:

**_modifications_** include additions, omissions and substitutions.

<h7 class="ActHead7">Part 3—Entities disqualified on registration under this Act</h7>

## 11  Entities disqualified on registration under this Act

(1)       An entity to whom a business name is registered under this Act must notify ASIC if the entity is disqualified on the day on which it is registered (the **_registration day_**).

(2)       The notice:

                     (a)  must be in the prescribed form; and

                     (b)  must be lodged in the prescribed manner; and

                     (c)  must be lodged within a period of 28 days beginning on:

                              (i)  where the business name is registered under item 2 or 3—the change‑over day; or

                             (ii)  where the business name is registered under another item—on the day on which notice of the registration is given to the entity by ASIC under that item.

(3)       If a business name is registered to an entity under this Act, but the entity is disqualified on the registration day:

                     (a)  section 21 of the Business Names Registration Act does not apply in relation to that disqualification; and

                     (b)  section 44 of the Business Names Registration Act does not apply in relation to that disqualification.

(4)       The Minister may determine in writing that the registration of the business name to the entity is to be cancelled, if the Minister is satisfied that, because of:

                     (a)  the seriousness of an offence on the basis of which the entity is disqualified; or

                     (b)  the number of offences on the basis of which the entity is disqualified;

allowing the entity to carry on a business under a business name poses a serious risk to consumers.

(5)       The Minister must not make a determination under subitem (4) if:

                     (a)  in a case where the business name was registered under a registration law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory in relation to a person who carried on a business alone under the name (rather than in association with other persons)—that person was registered under that law because leave was granted by a relevant court; or

                     (b)  in a case where the business name was registered under a registration law of a referring/adopting State or an affected Territory in relation to a person who carried on a business under the name in association with one or more other persons—each person who was registered under that law was registered either because leave was granted by a relevant court or because such leave was not necessary.

_Note:       Section 54 of the Business Names Registration Bill provides that a business name is held, and the entity does not commit an offence if the entity carries on a business under it, during the review period in relation to the cancellation._

(8)       If an entity fails to comply with subitem (6), the entity is taken to have lodged notice with ASIC accepting ASIC’s nomination.

(9)       ASIC must accept the alternative word or expression nominated by the entity unless ASIC is reasonably satisfied that, if:

                     (a)  the word or expression were added to the business name; and

                     (b)  the entity made application to register the business name as altered;

the business name as altered would not be available to the entity under section 25 of the Business Names Registration Bill.

(10)     ASIC must:

                     (a)  notify the entity in writing whether it accepts or rejects the alternative word or expression; and

## 20  ASIC must enter distinguishing word or expression on the Business Names Register

(1)       ASIC must enter the distinguishing word or expression that relates to a business or businesses carried on by an entity under a business name on the Business Names Register.

(2)       However, the distinguishing word or expression does not form part of the business name.

(3)       ASIC may remove the entry from the register if ASIC is satisfied that the removal of the distinguishing word or expression would not lead to confusion about who is carrying on a business or businesses under the business name.

(4)       If ASIC removes the entry from the register, ASIC must notify the following entities of the removal:

                     (a)  the entity to whom the business name is registered;

                     (b)  each entity for whom ASIC has contact details to whom the business name, or a nearly identical business name, was formerly registered.

(5)       ASIC may also notify any other entity of the removal of the distinguishing word or expression if ASIC is satisfied that the entity’s interests might be affected by the removal.

## 21  Name not available if identical or nearly identical to existing name accompanied by distinguishing word or expression

If a distinguishing word or expression is entered on the Business Names Register in relation to a business name registered to an entity, a name that is identical or nearly identical to any combination of the distinguishing word or expression and that business name is not **_available_** to any other entity.

                     (b)  the alternative registration period requested is:

                              (i)  if the registration period on renewal would otherwise have been 1 year—of not more than 18 months; and

                             (ii)  if the registration period on renewal would otherwise have been 3 years—of not more than 3 years and 6 months.

(3)       A determination under subitem (2) must be in writing, but is not a legislative instrument.
