IAEA. Each Party shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that such an

agreement is in force for it not later than eighteen months after the date of

entry into force for that Party of this Treaty.

	3.	For the purposes of this Treaty, the safeguards referred to in paragraph 1

shall have as their purpose the verification of the non-diversion of nuclear

material from peaceful nuclear activities to nuclear explosive devices.

Party and to the Director for the information of all Parties a copy of the

overall conclusions of the most recent report by the IAEA on its inspection

activities in the territory of the Party concerned, and to advise the Director

	1.	A Party which considers that there are grounds for a complaint that another

Party is in breach of its obligations under this Treaty shall, before bringing

such a complaint to the Director, bring the subject matter of the complaint to

the attention of the Party complained of and shall allow the latter reasonable

opportunity to provide it with an explanation and to resolve the matter.

	2.	If the matter is not so resolved, the complainant Party may bring the

complaint to the Director with a request that the Consultative Committee be

convened to consider it. Complaints shall be supported by an account of

evidence of breach of obligations known to the complainant Party. Upon receipt

as possible to consider it.

	3.	The Consultative Committee, taking account of efforts made under paragraph

1, shall afford the Party complained of a reasonable opportunity to provide it

with an explanation of the matter.

	4.	If, after considering any explanation given to it by the representatives of

the Party complained of, the Consultative Committee decides that there is

sufficient substance in the complaint to warrant a special inspection in the

territory of that Party or elsewhere, the Consultative Committee shall direct

that such special inspection be made as quickly as possible by a special

inspection team of three suitably qualified special inspectors appointed by the

Consultative Committee in consultation with the complained of and complainant

Parties, provided that no national of either Party shall serve on the special

inspection team. If so requested by the Party complained of, the special

inspection team shall be accompanied by representatives of that Party. Neither

the right of consultation on the appointment of special inspectors, nor the

right to accompany special inspectors, shall delay the work of the special

inspection team.

	5.	In making a special inspection, special inspectors shall be subject to the

direction only of the Consultative Committee and shall comply with such

directives concerning tasks, objectives, confidentiality and procedures as may

be decided upon by it. Directives shall take account of the legitimate

interests of the Party complained of in complying with its other international

obligations and commitments and shall not duplicate safeguards procedures to be

undertaken by the IAEA pursuant to agreements referred to in Annex 2 (1). The

special inspectors shall discharge their duties with due respect for the laws

of the Party complained of.

	6.	Each Party shall give to special inspectors full and free access to all

information and places within its territory which may be relevant to enable the

special inspectors to implement the directives given to them by the

Consultative Committee.

	7.	The Party complained of shall take all appropriate steps to facilitate the

special inspection, and shall grant to special inspectors privileges and

immunities necessary for the performance of their functions, including

inviolability for all papers and documents and immunity from arrest, detention

and legal process for acts done and words spoken and written, for the purpose

of the special inspection.

	8.	The special inspectors shall report in writing as quickly as possible to

the Consultative Committee, outlining their activities, setting out relevant

facts and information as ascertained by them, with supporting evidence and

documentation as appropriate, and stating their conclusions. The Consultative

Committee shall report fully to all Members of the South Pacific Forum, giving

its decision as to whether the Party complained of is in breach of its

obligations under this Treaty.

	9.	If the Consultative Committee has decided that the Party complained of is

in breach of its obligations under this Treaty, or that the above provisions

have not been complied with, or at any time at the request of either the

complainant or complained of Party, the Parties shall meet promptly at a

meeting of the South Pacific Forum.
