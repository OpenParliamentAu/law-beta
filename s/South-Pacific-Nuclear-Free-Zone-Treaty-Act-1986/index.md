The safeguards referred to in Article 8 shall in respect of<lf> each Party be applied by the IAEA as set forth in an agreement<lf> negotiated and concluded with the IAEA on all source or special<lf> fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within<lf> the territory of the Party, under its jurisdiction or carried out<lf> under its control anywhere.<lf>   2\. The agreement referred to in paragraph 1 shall be, or shall<lf> be equivalent in its scope and effect to, an agreement required<lf> in connection with the NPT on the basis of the material<lf> reproduced in document INFCIRC/153 (Corrected) of the IAEA. Each<lf> Party shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that such an<lf> agreement is in force for it not later than eighteen months after<lf> the date of entry into force for that Party of this Treaty.<lf>   3\. For the purposes of this Treaty, the safeguards referred to<lf> in paragraph 1 shall have as their purpose the verification of<lf> the non-diversion of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear<lf> activities to nuclear explosive devices.<lf>   4\.

There is hereby established a Consultative Committee which<lf> shall be convened by the Director from time to time pursuant to<lf> Articles 10 and 11 and Annex 4 (2). The Consultative Committee<lf> shall be constituted of representatives of the Parties, each<lf> Party being entitled to appoint one representative who may be<lf> accompanied by advisers. Unless otherwise agreed, the<lf> Consultative Committee shall be chaired at any given meeting by<lf> the representative of the Party which last hosted the meeting of<lf> Heads of Government of Members of the South Pacific Forum. A<lf> quorum shall be constituted by representatives of half the<lf> Parties.

A Party which considers that there are grounds for a<lf> complaint that another Party is in breach of its obligations<lf> under this Treaty shall, before bringing such a complaint to the<lf> Director, bring the subject matter of the complaint to the<lf> attention of the Party complained of and shall allow the latter<lf> reasonable opportunity to provide it with an explanation and to<lf> resolve the matter.<lf>   2\. If the matter is not so resolved, the complainant Party may<lf> bring the complaint to the Director with a request that the<lf> Consultative Committee be convened to consider it. Complaints<lf> shall be supported by an account of evidence of breach of<lf> obligations known to the complainant Party. Upon receipt of a<lf> complaint the Director shall convene the Consultative Committee<lf> as quickly as possible to consider it.<lf>   3\. The Consultative Committee, taking account of efforts made<lf> under paragraph 1, shall afford the Party complained of a<lf> reasonable opportunity to provide it with an explanation of the<lf> matter.<lf>   4\. If, after considering any explanation given to it by the<lf> representatives of the Party complained of, the Consultative<lf> Committee decides that there is sufficient substance in the<lf> complaint to warrant a special inspection in the territory of<lf> that Party or elsewhere, the Consultative Committee shall direct<lf> that such special inspection be made as quickly as possible by a<lf> special inspection team of three suitably qualified special<lf> inspectors appointed by the Consultative Committee in<lf> consultation with the complained of and complainant Parties,<lf> provided that no national of either Party shall serve on the<lf> special inspection team. If so requested by the Party complained<lf> of, the special inspection team shall be accompanied by<lf> representatives of that Party. Neither the right of consultation<lf> on the appointment of special inspectors, nor the right to<lf> accompany special inspectors, shall delay the work of the special<lf> inspection team.<lf>   5\. In making a special inspection, special inspectors shall be<lf> subject to the direction only of the Consultative Committee and<lf> shall comply with such directives concerning tasks, objectives,<lf> confidentiality and procedures as may be decided upon by it.<lf> Directives shall take account of the legitimate interests of the<lf> Party complained of in complying with its other international<lf> obligations and commitments and shall not duplicate safeguards<lf> procedures to be undertaken by the IAEA pursuant to agreements<lf> referred to in Annex 2 (1). The special inspectors shall<lf> discharge their duties with due respect for the laws of the Party<lf> complained of.<lf>   6\. Each Party shall give to special inspectors full and free<lf> access to all information and places within its territory which<lf> may be relevant to enable the special inspectors to implement the<lf> directives given to them by the Consultative Committee.<lf>   7\. The Party complained of shall take all appropriate steps to<lf> facilitate the special inspection, and shall grant to special<lf> inspectors privileges and immunities necessary for the<lf> performance of their functions, including inviolability for all<lf> papers and documents and immunity from arrest, detention and<lf> legal process for acts done and words spoken and written, for the<lf> purpose of the special inspection.<lf>   8\. The special inspectors shall report in writing as quickly as<lf> possible to the Consultative Committee, outlining their<lf> activities, setting out relevant facts and information as<lf> ascertained by them, with supporting evidence and documentation<lf> as appropriate, and stating their conclusions. The Consultative<lf> Committee shall report fully to all Members of the South Pacific<lf> Forum, giving its decision as to whether the Party complained of<lf> is in breach of its obligations under this Treaty.<lf>   9\. If the Consultative Committee has decided that the Party<lf> complained of is in breach of its obligations under this Treaty,<lf> or that the above provisions have not been complied with, or at<lf> any time at the request of either the complainant or complained<lf> of Party, the Parties shall meet promptly at a meeting of the<lf> South Pacific Forum.<lf> </lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf>
