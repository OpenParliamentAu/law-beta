## Part IV—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Review of certain decisions

             (1)  The trustees of a fund or unit trust that is affected by a reviewable decision of the Commissioner of Taxation may, if dissatisfied with the decision, by notice given to the Commissioner of Taxation within the period of 21 days after the day on which the trustees of the fund or unit trust first receive notice of the decision, or within such further period as the Commissioner of Taxation allows, request the Commissioner of Taxation to reconsider the decision.

             (6)  Applications may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation that have been confirmed or varied under subsection (3).

             (7)  Where a decision is deemed, by reason of the operation of subsection (4), to be confirmed, section 29 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the prescribed time for making application for review of the decision were the period commencing on the day on which the decision is deemed to be confirmed and ending on the twenty-eighth day after that day.

             (8)  Where a request is made under subsection (1) in respect of a reviewable decision, section 41 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the making of the request were the making of an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of that decision.

             (9)  The hearing of a proceeding relating to a reviewable decision shall take place in private and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may, by order:

                     (a)  give directions as to the persons who may be present; and

                     (b)  the trustees may, subject to the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, if dissatisfied with a decision made by the Commissioner of Taxation upon that reconsideration confirming or varying the first-mentioned decision, make application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision so confirmed or varied.

             (2)  Where the Commissioner of Taxation confirms or varies a reviewable decision under subsection 16(3) and gives to the trustees of a fund or unit trust notice in writing of the confirmation or variation of the decision, that notice shall include a statement to the effect that the trustees or the person may, subject to the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, if dissatisfied with the decision so confirmed or varied, make application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision.

             (3)  Any failure to comply with the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) in relation to a reviewable decision or a decision under subsection 16(3) does not affect the validity of that decision.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Regulations

             (1)  The Governor-General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing matters:
