LIMITS OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA<lf>                            Article 3<lf>                    Breadth of the territorial sea<lf> Every State has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial<lf> sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles, measured from<lf> baselines determined in accordance with this Convention.<lf>                              Article 4<lf>                   Outer limit of the territorial sea<lf> The outer limit of the territorial sea is the line every point of which<lf> is at a distance from the nearest point of the baseline equal to the<lf> breadth of the territorial sea.<lf>                              Article 5<lf>                           Normal baseline<lf> Except where otherwise provided in this Convention, the normal baseline<lf> for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line<lf> along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized<lf> by the coastal State.<lf>                              Article 6<lf>                                Reefs<lf> In the case of islands situated on atolls or of islands having fringing<lf> reefs, the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is<lf> the seaward low-water line of the reef, as shown by the appropriate<lf> symbol on charts officially recognized by the coastal State.<lf>                              Article 7<lf>                          Straight baselines<lf> 1\. In localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into,<lf> or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate<lf> vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points<lf> may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the<lf> territorial sea is measured.<lf> 2\. Where because of the presence of a delta and other natural<lf> conditions the coastline is highly unstable, the appropriate points may<lf> be selected along the furthest seaward extent of the low-water line<lf> and, notwithstanding subsequent regression of the low-water line, the<lf> straight baselines shall remain effective until changed by the coastal<lf> State in accordance with this Convention.<lf> 3\. The drawing of straight baselines must not depart to any appreciable<lf> extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying<lf> within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain<lf> to be subject to the regime of internal waters.<lf> 4\. Straight baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide<lf> elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are<lf> permanently above sea level have been built on them or except in<lf> instances where the drawing of baselines to and from such elevations<lf> has received general international recognition.<lf> 5\. Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under paragraph<lf> 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of<lf> economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and<lf> the importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage.<lf> 6\. The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in<lf> such a manner as to cut off the territorial sea of another State from<lf> the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.<lf>                              Article 8<lf>                           Internal waters<lf> 1\. Except as provided in Part IV, waters on the landward side of the<lf> baseline of the territorial sea form part of the internal waters of the<lf> State.<lf> 2\. Where the establishment of a straight baseline in accordance with<lf> the method set forth in article 7 has the effect of enclosing as<lf> internal water areas which had not previously been considered as such,<lf> a right of innocent passage as provided in this Convention shall exist<lf> in those waters.<lf>                              Article 9<lf>                           Mouths of rivers<lf> If a river flows directly into the sea, the baseline shall be a<lf> straight line across the mouth of the river between points on the<lf> low-water line of its banks.<lf>                              Article 10<lf>                                 Bays<lf> 1\. This article relates only to bays the coasts of which belong to a<lf> single State.<lf> 2\. For the purposes of this Convention, a bay is a well-marked<lf> indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its<lf> mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere<lf> curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded<lf> as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the<lf> semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that<lf> indentation.<lf> 3\. For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that<lf> lying between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation<lf> and a line joining the low-water mark of its natural entrance points.<lf> Where, because of the presence of islands, an indentation has more than<lf> one mouth, the semi-circle shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum<lf> total of the lengths of the lines across the different mouths. Islands<lf> within an indentation shall be included as if they were part of the<lf> water area of the indentation.<lf> 4\. If the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance<lf> points of a bay does not exceed 24 nautical miles, a closing line may<lf> be drawn between these two low-water marks, and the waters enclosed<lf> thereby shall be considered as internal waters.<lf> 5\. Where the distance between the low-water marks of the natural<lf> entrance points of a bay exceeds 24 nautical miles, a straight baseline<lf> of 24 nautical miles shall be drawn within the bay in such a manner as<lf> to enclose the maximum area of water that is possible with a line of<lf> that length.<lf> 6\. The foregoing provisions do not apply to so-called "historic" bays,<lf> or in any case where the system of straight baselines provided for in<lf> article 7 is applied.<lf>                              Article 11<lf>                                 Ports<lf> For the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the outermost<lf> permanent harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour<lf> system are regarded as forming part of the coast. Off-shore<lf> installations and artificial islands shall not be considered as<lf> permanent harbour works.<lf>                              Article 12<lf>                              Roadsteads<lf> Roadsteads which are normally used for the loading, unloading and<lf> anchoring of ships, and which would otherwise be situated wholly or<lf> partly outside the outer limit of the territorial sea, are included in<lf> the territorial sea.<lf>                              Article 13<lf>                          Low-tide elevations<lf> 1\. A low-tide elevation is a naturally formed area of land which is<lf> surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide.<lf> Where a low-tide elevation is situated wholly or partly at a distance<lf> not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or<lf> an island, the low-water line on that elevation may be used as the<lf> baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea.<lf> 2\. Where a low-tide elevation is wholly situated at a distance<lf> exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an<lf> island, it has no territorial sea of its own.<lf>                              Article 14<lf>           Combination of methods for determining baselines<lf> The coastal State may determine baselines in turn by any of the methods<lf> provided for in the foregoing articles to suit different conditions.<lf>                              Article 15<lf>        Delimitation of the territorial sea between States with<lf>                     opposite or adjacent coasts<lf> Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other,<lf> neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them<lf> to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line<lf> every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the<lf> baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the<lf> two States is measured. The above provision does not apply, however,<lf> where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special<lf> circumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a<lf> way in which is at variance therewith.<lf>                              Article 16<lf>            Charts and lists of geographical co-ordinates<lf> 1\. The baselines for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea<lf> determined in accordance with articles 7, 9 and 10, or the limits<lf> derived therefrom, and the lires of delimitation drawn in accordance<lf> with articles 12 and 15 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales<lf> adequate for ascertaining their position. Alternatively, a list of<lf> geographical co-ordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may<lf> be substituted.<lf> 2\. The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists<lf> of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such<lf> chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<lf>                               SECTION 3.<lf>             INNOCENT PASSAGE IN THE TERRITORIAL SEA<lf>           SUBSECTION A. RULES APPLICABLE TO ALL SHIPS<lf>                              Article 17<lf>                      Right of innocent passage<lf> Subject to this Convention, ships of all States, whether coastal or<lf> land-locked, enjoy the right of innocent passage through the<lf> territorial sea.<lf>                              Article 18<lf>                          Meaning of passage<lf> 1\. Passage means navigation through the territorial sea for the purpose<lf> of:<lf> (a) traversing that sea without entering internal waters or calling at<lf> a roadstead or port facility outside internal waters; or<lf> (b) proceeding to or from internal waters or a call at such roadstead<lf> or port facility.<lf> 2\. Passage shall be continuous and expeditious. However, passage<lf> includes stopping and anchoring, but only in so far as the same are<lf> incidental to ordinary navigation or are rendered necessary by force<lf> majeure or distress or for the purpose of rendering assistance to<lf> persons, ships or aircraft in danger or distress.<lf>                              Article 19<lf>                      Meaning of innocent passage<lf> 1\. Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace,<lf> good order or security of the coastal State. Such passage shall take<lf> place in conformity with this Convention and with other rules of<lf> international law.<lf> 2\. Passage of a foreign ship shall be considered to be prejudicial to<lf> the peace, good order or security of the coastal State if in the<lf> territorial sea it engages in any of the following activities:<lf> (a) any threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial<lf> integrity or political independence of the coastal State, or in any<lf> other manner in violation of the principles of international law<lf> embodied in the Charter of the United Nations;<lf> (b) any exercise or practice with weapons of any kind;<lf> (c) any act aimed at collecting information to the prejudice of the<lf> defence or security of the coastal State;<lf> (d) any act or propaganda aimed at affecting the defence or security of<lf> the coastal State;<lf> (e) the launching, landing or taking on board of any aircraft;<lf> (f) the launching, landing or taking on board of any military device;<lf> (g) the loading or unloading of any commodity, currency or person<lf> contrary to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and<lf> regulations of the coastal State;<lf> (h) any act of wilful and serious pollution contrary to this<lf> Convention;<lf> (i) any fishing activities;<lf> (j) the carrying out of research or survey activities;<lf> (k) any act aimed at interfering with any systems of communication or<lf> any other facilities or installations of the coastal State;<lf> (l) any other activity not having a direct bearing on passage.<lf>                              Article 20<lf>               Submarines and other underwater vehicles<lf> In the territorial sea, submarines and other underwater vehicles are<lf> required to navigate on the surface and to show their flag.<lf>                              Article 21<lf>               Laws and regulations of the coastal State<lf>                      relating to innocent passage<lf> 1\. The coastal State may adopt laws and regulations, in conformity with<lf> the provisions of this Convention and other rules of international law,<lf> relating to innocent passage through the territorial sea, in respect of<lf> all or any of the following:<lf> (a) the safety of navigation and the regulation of maritime traffic;<lf> (b) the protection of navigational aids and facilities and other<lf> facilities or installations;<lf> (c) the protection of cables and pipelines;<lf> (d) the conservation of the living resources of the sea;<lf> (e) the prevention of infringement of the fisheries laws and<lf> regulations of the coastal State;<lf> (f) the preservation of the environment of the coastal State and the<lf> prevention, reduction and control of pollution thereof;<lf> (g) marine scientific research and hydrographic surveys;<lf> (h) the prevention of infringement of the customs, fiscal, immigration<lf> or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal State.<lf> 2\. Such laws and regulations shall not apply to the design,<lf> construction, manning or equipment of foreign ships unless they are<lf> giving effect to generally accepted international rules or standards.<lf> 3\. The coastal State shall give due publicity to all such laws and<lf> regulations.<lf> 4\. Foreign ships exercising the right of innocent passage through the<lf> territorial sea shall comply with all such laws and regulations and all<lf> generally accepted international regulations relating to the<lf> prevention of collisions at sea.<lf>                              Article 22<lf>             Sea lanes and traffic separation schemes in<lf>                         the territorial sea<lf> 1\. The coastal State may, where necessary having regard to the safety<lf> of navigation, require foreign ships exercising the right of innocent<lf> passage through its territorial sea to use such sea lanes and traffic<lf> separation schemes as it may designate or prescribe for the regulation<lf> of the passage of ships.<lf> 2\. In particular, tankers, nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying<lf> nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances or<lf> materials may be required to confine their passage to such sea lanes.<lf> 3\. In the designation of sea lanes and the prescription of traffic<lf> separation schemes under this article, the coastal State shall take<lf> into account:<lf> (a) the recommendations of the competent international organization;<lf> (b) any channels customarily used for international navigation;<lf> (c) the special characteristics of particular ships and channels; and<lf> (d) the density of traffic.<lf> 4\. The coastal State shall clearly indicate such sea lanes and traffic<lf> separation schemes on charts to which due publicity shall be given.<lf>                              Article 23<lf>         Foreign nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying<lf>         nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious<lf>                              substances<lf> Foreign nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying nuclear or other<lf> inherently dangerous or noxious substances shall, when exercising the<lf> right of innocent passage through the territorial sea, carry documents<lf> and observe special precautionary measures established for such ships<lf> by international agreements.<lf>                              Article 24<lf>                      Duties of the coastal State<lf> 1\. The coastal State shall not hamper the innocent passage of foreign<lf> ships through the territorial sea except in accordance with this<lf> Convention. In particular, in the application of this Convention or of<lf> any laws or regulations adopted in conformity with this Convention, the<lf> coastal State shall not:<lf> (a) impose requirements on foreign ships which have the practical<lf> effect of denying or impairing the right of innocent passage; or<lf> (b) discriminate in form or in fact against the ships of any State or<lf> against ships carrying cargoes to, from or on behalf of any State.<lf> 2\. The coastal State shall give appropriate publicity to any danger to<lf> navigation, of which it has knowledge, within its territorial sea.<lf>                              Article 25<lf>               Rights of protection of the coastal State<lf> 1\. The coastal State may take the necessary steps in its territorial<lf> sea to prevent passage which is not innocent.<lf> 2\. In the case of ships proceeding to internal waters or a call at a<lf> port facility outside internal waters, the coastal State also has the<lf> right to take the necessary steps to prevent any breach of the<lf> conditions to which admission of those ships to internal waters or such<lf> a call is subject.<lf> 3\. The coastal State may, without discrimination in form or in fact<lf> among foreign ships, suspend temporarily in specified areas of its<lf> territorial sea the innocent passage of foreign ships if such<lf> suspension is essential for the protection of its security, including<lf> weapons exercises. Such suspension shall take effect only after having<lf> been duly published.<lf>                              Article 26<lf>            Charges which may be levied upon foreign ships<lf> 1\. No charge may be levied upon foreign ships by reason only of their<lf> passage through the territorial sea.<lf> 2\. Charges may be levied upon a foreign ship passing through the<lf> territorial sea as payment only for specific services rendered to the<lf> ship. These charges shall be levied without discrimination.<lf>                            SUBSECTION B.<lf>              RULES APPLICABLE TO MERCHANT SHIPS AND<lf>         GOVERNMENT SHIPS OPERATED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES<lf>                              Article 27<lf>               Criminal jurisdiction on board a foreign ship<lf> 1\. The criminal jurisdiction of the coastal State should not be<lf> exercised on board a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea<lf> to arrest any person or to conduct any investigation in connection with<lf> any crime committed on board the ship during its passage, save only in<lf> the following cases:<lf> (a) if the consequences of the crime extend to the coastal State;<lf> (b) if the crime is of a kind to disturb the peace of the country or<lf> the good order of the territorial sea;<lf> (c) if the assistance of the local authorities has been requested by<lf> the master of the ship or by a diplomatic agent or consular officer of<lf> the flag State; or<lf> (d) if such measures are necessary for the suppression of illicit<lf> traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.<lf> 2\. The above provisions do not affect the right of the coastal State to<lf> take any steps authorized by its laws for the purpose of an arrest or<lf> investigation on board a foreign ship passing through the territorial<lf> sea after leaving internal waters.<lf> 3\. In the cases provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2, the coastal State<lf> shall, if the master so requests, notify a diplomatic agent or consular<lf> officer of the flag State before taking any steps, and shall facilitate<lf> contact between such agent or officer and the ship's crew. In cases of<lf> emergency this notification may be communicated while the measures are<lf> being taken.<lf> 4\. In considering whether or in what manner an arrest should be made,<lf> the local authorities shall have due regard to the interests of<lf> navigation.<lf> 5\. Except as provided in Part XII or with respect to violations of laws<lf> and regulations adopted in accordance with Part V, the coastal State<lf> may not take any steps on board a foreign ship passing through the<lf> territorial sea to arrest any person or to conduct any investigation in<lf> connection with any crime committed before the ship entered the<lf> territorial sea, if the ship, proceeding from a foreign port, is only<lf> passing through the territorial sea without entering internal waters.<lf>                              Article 28<lf>           Civil jurisdiction in relation to foreign ships<lf> 1\. The coastal State should not stop or divert a foreign ship passing<lf> through the territorial sea for the purpose of exercising civil<lf> jurisdiction in relation to a person on board the ship.<lf> 2\. The coastal State may not levy execution against or arrest the ship<lf> for the purpose of any civil proceedings, save only in respect of<lf> obligations or liabilities assumed or incurred by the ship itself in<lf> the course or for the purpose of its voyage through the waters of the<lf> coastal State.<lf> 3\. Paragraph 2 is without prejudice to the right of the coastal State,<lf> in accordance with its laws, to levy execution against or to arrest,<lf> for the purpose of any civil proceedings, a foreign ship lying in the<lf> territorial sea, or passing through the territorial sea after leaving<lf> internal waters.<lf>                             SUBSECTION C.<lf>             RULES APPLICABLE TO WARSHIPS AND OTHER<lf>       GOVERNMENT SHIPS OPERATED FOR NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES<lf>                              Article 29<lf>                        Definition of warships<lf> For the purpose of this Convention, "warship" means a ship belonging to<lf> the armed forces of a State bearing the external marks distinguishing<lf> such ships of its nationality, under the command of an officer duly<lf> commissioned by the government of the State and whose name appears in<lf> the appropriate service list or its equivalent, and manned by a crew<lf> which is under regular armed forces discipline.<lf>                              Article 30<lf>              Non-compliance by warships with the laws and<lf>                   regulations of the coastal State<lf> If any warship does not comply with the laws and regulations of the<lf> coastal State concerning passage through the territorial sea and<lf> disregards any request for compliance therewith which is made to it,<lf> the coastal State may require it to leave the territorial sea<lf> immediately.<lf>                              Article 31<lf>              Responsibility of the flag State for damage<lf>             caused by a warship or other government ship<lf>                 operated for non-commercial purposes<lf> The flag State shall bear international responsibility for any loss or<lf> damage to the coastal State resulting from the non-compliance by a<lf> warship or other government ship operated for non-commercial purposes<lf> with the laws and regulations of the coastal State concerning passages<lf> through the territorial sea or with the provisions of this Convention<lf> or other rules of international law.<lf>                              Article 32<lf>             Immunities of warships and other government<lf>              ships operated for non-commercial purposes<lf> With such exceptions as are contained in subsection A and in articles<lf> 30 and 31, nothing in this Convention affects the immunities of<lf> warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial<lf> purposes.<lf>                     SECTION 4\.

In exercising their rights and performing their duties under this<lf> Convention in the exclusive economic zone, States shall have due regard<lf> to the rights and duties of the coastal State and shall comply with the<lf> laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with<lf> the provisions of this Convention and other rules of international law<lf> in so far as they are not incompatible with this Part.<lf>                              Article 59<lf>             Basis for the resolution of conflicts regarding<lf>              the attribution of rights and jurisdiction in<lf>                      the exclusive economic zone<lf> In cases where this Convention does not attribute rights or<lf> jurisdiction to the coastal State or to other States within the<lf> exclusive economic zone, and a conflict arises between the interests of<lf> the coastal State and any other State or States, the conflict should be<lf> resolved on the basis of equity and in the light of all the relevant<lf> circumstances, taking into account the respective importance of the<lf> interests involved to the parties as well as to the international<lf> community as a whole.<lf>                              Article 60<lf>         Artificial islands, installations and structures<lf>                   in the exclusive economic zone<lf> 1\. In the exclusive economic zone, the coastal State shall have the<lf> exclusive right to construct and to authorize and regulate the<lf> construction, operation and use of:<lf> (a) artificial islands;<lf> (b) installations and structures for the purposes provided for in<lf> article 56 and other economic purposes;<lf> (c) installations and structures which may interfere with the exercise<lf> of the rights of the coastal State in the zone.<lf> 2\. The coastal State shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such<lf> artificial islands, installations and structures, including<lf> jurisdiction with regard to customs, fiscal, health, safety and<lf> immigration laws and regulations.<lf> 

3\. Due notice must be given of the construction of such artificial<lf> islands, installations or structures, and permanent means for giving<lf> warning of their presence must be maintained. Any installations or<lf> structures which are abandoned or disused shall be removed to ensure<lf> safety of navigation, taking into account any generally accepted<lf> international standards established in this regard by the competent<lf> international organization. Such removal shall also have due regard to<lf> fishing, the protection of the marine environment and the rights and<lf> duties of other States. Appropriate publicity shall be given to the<lf> depth, position and dimensions of any installations or structures not<lf> entirely removed.<lf> 4\. The coastal State may, where necessary, establish reasonable safety<lf> zones around such artificial islands, installations and structures in<lf> which it may take appropriate measures to ensure the safety both of<lf> navigation and of the artificial islands, installations and structures.<lf> 5\. The breadth of the safety zones shall be determined by the coastal<lf> State, taking into account applicable international standards. Such<lf> zones shall be designed to ensure that they are reasonably related to<lf> the nature and function of the artificial islands, installations or<lf> structures, and shall not exceed a distance of 500 metres around them,<lf> measured from each point of their outer edge, except as authorized by<lf> generally accepted international standards or as recommended by the<lf> competent international organization. Due notice shall be given of the<lf> extent of safety zones.<lf> 6\. All ships must respect these safety zones and shall comply with<lf> generally accepted international standards regarding navigation in the<lf> vicinity of artificial islands, installations, structures and safety<lf> zones.<lf> 7\. Artificial islands, installations and structures and the safety<lf> zones around them may not be established where interference may be<lf> caused to the use of recognized sea lanes essential to international<lf> navigation.<lf> 8\. Artificial islands, installations and structures do not possess the<lf> status of islands. They have no territorial sea of their own, and their<lf> presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea, the<lf> exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf.<lf>                              Article 61<lf>                 Conservation of the living resources<lf> 1\. The coastal State shall determine the allowable catch of the living<lf> resources in its exclusive economic zone.<lf> 2\. The coastal State, taking into account the best scientific evidence<lf> available to it, shall ensure through proper conservation and<lf> management measures that the maintenance of the living resources in the<lf> exclusive economic zone is not endangered by over-exploitation. As<lf> appropriate, the coastal State and competent international<lf> organizations, whether subregional, regional or global, shall<lf> co-operate to this end.<lf> 3\. Such measures shall also be designed to maintain or restore<lf> populations of harvested species at levels which can produce the<lf> maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and<lf> economic factors, including the economic needs of coastal fishing<lf> communities and the special requirements of developing States, and<lf> taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and<lf> any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether<lf> subregional, regional or global.<lf> 4\. In taking such measures the coastal State shall take into<lf> consideration the effects on species associated with or dependent upon<lf> harvested species with a view to maintaining or restoring populations<lf> of such associated or dependent species above levels at which their<lf> reproduction may become seriously threatened.<lf> 5\. Available scientific information, catch and fishing effort<lf> statistics, and other data relevant to the conservation of fish stocks<lf> shall be contributed and exchanged on a regular basis through competent<lf> international organizations, whether subregional, regional or global,<lf> where appropriate and with participation by all States concerned,<lf> including States whose nationals are allowed to fish in the exclusive<lf> economic zone.<lf>                              Article 62<lf>                 Utilization of the living resources<lf> 1\. The coastal State shall promote the objective of optimum utilization<lf> of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone without<lf> prejudice to article 61.<lf> 2\. The coastal State shall determine its capacity to harvest the living<lf> resources of the exclusive economic zone. Where the coastal State does<lf> not have the capacity to harvest the entire allowable catch, it shall,<lf> through agreements or other arrangements and pursuant to the terms,<lf> conditions, laws and regulations referred to in paragraph 4, give other<lf> States access to the surplus of the allowable catch, having particular<lf> regard to the provisions of articles 69 and 70, especially in relation<lf> to the developing States mentioned therein.<lf> 3\. In giving access to other States to its exclusive economic zone<lf> under this article, the coastal State shall take into account all<lf> relevant factors, including, inter alia, the significance of the living<lf> resources of the area to the economy of the coastal State concerned and<lf> its other national interests, the provisions of articles 69 and 70, the<lf> requirements of developing States in the subregion or region in<lf> harvesting part of the surplus and the need to minimize economic<lf> dislocation in States whose nationals have habitually fished in the<lf> zone or which have made substantial efforts in research and<lf> identification of stocks.<lf> 4\. Nationals of other States fishing in the exclusive economic zone<lf> shall comply with the conservation measures and with the other terms<lf> and conditions established in the laws and regulations of the coastal<lf> State. These laws and regulations shall be consistent with this<lf> Convention and may relate, inter alia, to the following:<lf> (a) licensing of fishermen, fishing vessels and equipment, including<lf> payment of fees and other forms of remuneration, which, in the case of<lf> developing coastal States, may consist of adequate compensation in the<lf> field of financing, equipment and technology relating to the fishing<lf> industry;<lf> (b) determining the species which may be caught, and fixing quotas of<lf> catch, whether in relation to particular stocks or groups of stocks or<lf> catch per vessel over a period of time or to the catch by nationals of<lf> any State during a specified period;<lf> (c) regulating seasons and areas of fishing, the types, sizes and<lf> amount of gear, and the types, sizes and number of fishing vessels that<lf> may be used;<lf> (d) fixing the age and size of fish and other species that may be<lf> caught;<lf> (e) specifying information required of fishing vessels, including catch<lf> and effort statistics and vessel position reports;<lf> (f) requiring, under the authorization and control of the coastal<lf> State, the conduct of specified fisheries research programmes and<lf> regulating the conduct of such research, including the sampling of<lf> catches, disposition of samples and reporting of associated scientific<lf> data;<lf> (g) the placing of observers or trainees on board such vessels by the<lf> coastal State;<lf> (h) the landing of all or any part of the catch by such vessels in the<lf> ports of the coastal State;<lf> (i) terms and conditions relating to joint ventures or other<lf> co-operative arrangements;<lf> (j) requirements for the training of personnel and the transfer of<lf> fisheries technology, including enhancement of the coastal State's<lf> capability of undertaking fisheries research;<lf> (k) enforcement procedures.<lf> 5\. Coastal States shall give due notice of conservation and management<lf> laws and regulations.<lf>                              Article 63<lf>        Stocks occurring within the exclusive economic zones of<lf>         two or more coastal States or both within the exclusive<lf>          economic zone and in an area beyond and adjacent to it<lf> 1\. Where the same stock or stocks of associated species occur within<lf> the exclusive economic zones of two or more coastal States, these<lf> States shall seek, either directly or through appropriate subregional<lf> or regional organizations, to agree upon the measures necessary to<lf> co-ordinate and ensure the conservation and development of such stocks<lf> without prejudice to the other provisions of this Part.<lf> 2\. Where the same stock or stock of associated species occur both<lf> within the exclusive economic zone and in an area beyond and adjacent<lf> to the zone, the coastal State and the States fishing for such stocks<lf> in the adjacent area shall seek, either directly or through appropriate<lf> subregional or regional organizations, to agree upon the measures<lf> necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent area.<lf>                              Article 64<lf>                        Highly migratory species<lf> 1\. The coastal State and other States whose nationals fish in the<lf> region for the highly migratory species listed in Annex I shall<lf> co-operate directly or through appropriate international organizations<lf> with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of<lf> optimum utilization of such species throughout the region, both within<lf> and beyond the exclusive economic zone. In regions for which no<lf> appropriate international organization exists, the coastal State and<lf> other States whose nationals harvest these species in the region shall<lf> co-operate to establish such an organization and participate in its<lf> work.<lf> 2\. The provisions of paragraph 1 apply in addition to the other<lf> provisions of this Part.<lf>                              Article 65<lf>                            Marine mammals<lf> Nothing in this Part restricts the right of a coastal State or the<lf> competence of an international organization, as appropriate, to<lf> prohibit, limit or regulate the exploitation of marine mammals more<lf> strictly than provided for in this Part. States shall co-operate with a<lf> view to the conservation of marine mammals and in the case of cetaceans<lf> shall in particular work through the appropriate international<lf> organizations for their conservation, management and study.<lf>                              Article 66<lf>                          Anadromous stocks<lf> 1\. States in whose rivers anadromous stocks originate shall have the<lf> primary interest in and responsibility for such stocks.<lf> 2\. The State of origin of anadromous stocks shall ensure their<lf> conservation by the establishment of appropriate regulatory measures<lf> for fishing in all waters landward of the outer limits of its exclusive<lf> economic zone and for fishing provided for in paragraph 3 (b). The<lf> State of origin may, after consultations with the other States referred<lf> to in paragraphs 3 and 4 fishing these stocks, establish total<lf> allowable catches for stocks originating in its rivers.<lf> 3.(a) Fisheries for anadromous stocks shall be conducted only in waters<lf> landward of the outer limits of exclusive economic zones, except in<lf> cases where this provision would result in economic dislocation for a<lf> State other than the State of origin. With respect to such fishing<lf> beyond the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone, States<lf> concerned shall maintain consultations with a view to achieving<lf> agreement on terms and conditions of such fishing giving due regard to<lf> the conservation requirements and the needs of the State of origin in<lf> respect of these stocks.<lf> (b) The State of origin shall co-operate in minimizing economic<lf> dislocation in such other States fishing these stocks, taking into<lf> account the normal catch and the mode of operations of such States, and<lf> all the areas in which such fishing has occurred.<lf> (c) States referred to in subparagraph (b),participating by agreement<lf> with the State of origin in measures to renew anadromous stocks,<lf> particularly by expenditures for that purpose, shall be given special<lf> consideration by the State of origin in the harvesting of stocks<lf> originating in its rivers.<lf> (d) Enforcement of regulations regarding anadromous stocks beyond the<lf> exclusive economic zone shall be by agreement between the State of<lf> origin and the other States concerned.<lf> 4\. In cases where anadromous stocks migrate into or through the waters<lf> landward of the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone of a State<lf> other than the State of origin, such State shall co-operate with the<lf> State of origin with regard to the conservation and management of such<lf> stocks.<lf> 5\. The State of origin of anadromous stocks and other States fishing<lf> these stocks shall make arrangements for the implementation of the<lf> provisions of this article, where appropriate, through regional<lf> organizations.<lf>                              Article 67<lf>                          Catadromous species<lf> 1\. A coastal State in whose waters catadromous species spend the<lf> greater part of their life cycle shall have responsibility for the<lf> management of these species and shall ensure the ingress and egress of<lf> migrating fish.<lf> 2\. Harvesting of catadromous species shall be conducted only in waters<lf> landward of the outer limits of exclusive economic zones. When<lf> conducted in exclusive economic zones, harvesting shall be subject to<lf> this article and the other provisions of this Convention concerning<lf> fishing in these zones.<lf> 3\. In cases where catadromous fish migrate through the exclusive<lf> economic zone of another State, whether as juvenile or maturing fish,<lf> the management, including harvesting, of such fish shall be regulated<lf> by agreement between the State mentioned in paragraph 1 and the other<lf> State concerned. Such agreement shall ensure the rational management of<lf> the species and take into account the responsibilities of the State<lf> mentioned in paragraph 1 for the maintenance of these species.<lf>                              Article 68<lf>                           Sedentary species<lf> This Part does not apply to sedentary species as defined in article 77,<lf> paragraph 4.<lf>                              Article 69<lf>                      Right of land-locked States<lf> 1\. Land-locked States shall have the right to participate, on an<lf> equitable basis, in the exploitation of an appropriate part of the<lf> surplus of the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of<lf> coastal States of the same subregion or region, taking into account the<lf> relevant economic and geographical circumstances of all the States<lf> concerned in conformity with the provisions of this article and of<lf> articles 61 and 62.<lf> 2\. The terms and modalities of such participation shall be established<lf> by the States concerned through bilateral, subregional or regional<lf> agreements taking into account, inter alia:<lf> (a) the need to avoid effects detrimental to fishing communities or<lf> fishing industries of the coastal State;<lf> (b) the extent to which the land-locked State, in accordance with the<lf> provisions of this article, is participating or is entitled to<lf> participate under existing bilateral, subregional or regional<lf> agreements in the exploitation of living resources of the exclusive<lf> economic zones of other coastal States;<lf> (c) the extent to which other land-locked States and geographically<lf> disadvantaged States are participating in the exploitation of the<lf> living resources of the exclusive economic zone of the coastal State<lf> and the consequent need to avoid a particular burden for any single<lf> coastal State or a part of it;<lf> (d) the nutritional needs of the populations of the respective States.<lf> 3\. When the harvesting capacity of a coastal State approaches a point<lf> which would enable it to harvest the entire allowable catch of the<lf> living resources in its exclusive economic zone, the coastal State and<lf> other States concerned shall co-operate in the establishment of<lf> equitable arrangements on a bilateral, subregional or regional basis to<lf> allow for participation of developing land-locked States of the same<lf> subregion or region in the exploitation of the living resources of the<lf> exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the subregion or region,<lf> as may be appropriate in the cirumstances and on terms satisfactory to<lf> all parties. In the implementation of this provision the factors<lf> mentioned in paragraph 2 shall also be taken into account.<lf> 4\. Developed land-locked States shall, under the provisions of this<lf> article, be entitled to participate in the exploitation of living<lf> resources only in the exclusive economic zones of developed coastal<lf> States of the same subregion or region having regard to the extent to<lf> which the coastal State, in giving access to other States to the living<lf> resources of its exclusive economic zone, has taken into account the<lf> need to minimize detrimental effects on fishing communities and<lf> economic dislocation in States whose nationals have habitually fished<lf> in the zone.<lf> 5\. The above provisions are without prejudice to arrangements agreed<lf> upon in subregions or regions where the coastal States may grant to<lf> land-locked States of the same subregion or region equal or<lf> preferential rights for the exploitation of the living resources in the<lf> exclusive economic zones.<lf>                              Article 70<lf>               Right of geographically disadvantaged States<lf> 1\. Geographically disadvantaged States shall have the right to<lf> participate, on an equitable basis, in the exploitation of an<lf> appropriate part of the surplus of the living resources of the<lf> exclusive economic zones of coastal States of the same subregion or<lf> region, taking into account the relevant economic and geographical<lf> circumstances of all the States concerned and in conformity with the<lf> provisions of this article and of articles 61 and 62.<lf> 2\. For the purposes of this Part, "geographically disadvantaged States"<lf> means coastal States, including States bordering enclosed or<lf> semi-enclosed seas, whose geographical situation makes them dependent upon<lf> the exploitation of the living resources of the exclusive economic<lf> zones of other States in the subregion or region for adequate supplies<lf> of fish for the nutritional purposes of their populations or parts<lf> thereof, and coastal States which can claim no exclusive economic zones<lf> of their own.<lf> 3\. The terms and modalities of such participation shall be established<lf> by the States concerned through bilateral, subregional or regional<lf> agreements taking into account, inter alia:<lf> (a) the need to avoid effects detrimental to fishing communities or<lf> fishing industries of the coastal State;<lf> (b) the extent to which the geographically disadvantaged State, in<lf> accordance with the provisions of this article, is participating or is<lf> entitled to participate under existing bilateral, subregional or<lf> regional agreements in the exploitation of living resources of the<lf> exclusive economic zones of other coastal States;<lf> (c) the extent to which other geographically disadvantaged States and<lf> land-locked States are participating in the exploitation of the living<lf> resources of the exclusive economic zone of the coastal State and the<lf> consequent need to avoid a particular burden for any single coastal<lf> State or a part of it;<lf> (d) the nutritional needs of the populations of the respective States.<lf> 4\. When the harvesting capacity of a coastal State approaches a point<lf> which would enable it to harvest the entire allowable catch of the<lf> living resources in its exclusive economic zone, the coastal State and<lf> other States concerned shall co-operate in the establishment of<lf> equitable arrangements on a bilateral, subregional or regional basis to<lf> allow for participation of developing geographically disadvantaged<lf> States of the same subregion or region in the exploitation of the<lf> living resources of the exclusive economic zones of coastal States of<lf> the subregion or region, as may be appropriate in the circumstances and<lf> on terms satisfactory to all parties. In the implementation of this<lf> provision the factors mentioned in paragraph 3 shall also be taken into<lf> account.<lf> 5\. Developed geographically disadvantaged States shall, under the<lf> provisions of this article, be entitled to participate in the<lf> exploitation of living resources only in the exclusive economic zones<lf> of developed coastal States of the same subregion or region having<lf> regard to the extent to which the coastal State, in giving access to<lf> other States to the living resources of its exclusive economic zone,<lf> has taken into account the need to minimize detrimental effects on<lf> fishing communities and economic dislocation in States whose nationals<lf> have habitually fished in the zone.<lf> 6\. The above provisions are without prejudice to arrangements agreed<lf> upon in subregions or regions where the coastal States may grant to<lf> geographically disadvantaged States of the same subregion or region<lf> equal or preferential rights for the exploitation of the living<lf> resources in the exclusive economic zones.<lf>                              Article 71<lf>                  Non-applicability of articles 69 and 70<lf> The provisions of articles 69 and 70 do not apply in the case of a<lf> coastal State whose economy is overwhelmingly dependent on the<lf> exploitation of the living resources of its exclusive economic zone.<lf>                              Article 72<lf>                    Restrictions on transfer of rights<lf> 1\. Rights provided under articles 69 and 70 to exploit living resources<lf> shall not be directly or indirectly transferred to third States or<lf> their nationals by lease or licence, by establishing joint ventures or<lf> in any other manner which has the effect of such transfer unless<lf> otherwise agreed by the States concerned.<lf> 2\. The foregoing provision does not preclude the States concerned from<lf> obtaining technical or financial assistance from third States or<lf> international organizations in order to facilitate the exercise of the<lf> rights pursuant to articles 69 and 70, provided that it does not have<lf> the effect referred to in paragraph 1.<lf>                              Article 73<lf>              Enforcement of laws and regulations of the<lf>                             coastal State<lf> 1\. The coastal State may, in the exercise of its sovereign rights to<lf> explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living resources in the<lf> exclusive economic zone, take such measures, including boarding,<lf> inspection, arrest and judicial proceedings, as may be necessary to<lf> ensure compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by it in<lf> conformity with this Convention.<lf> 2\. Arrested vessels and their crews shall be promptly released upon the<lf> posting of reasonable bond or other security.<lf> 3\. Coastal State penalties for violations of fisheries laws and<lf> regulations in the exclusive economic zone may not include<lf> imprisonment, in the absence of agreements to the contrary by the<lf> States concerned, or any other form of corporal punishment.<lf> 4\. In cases of arrest or detention of foreign vessels the coastal State<lf> shall promptly notify the flag State, through appropriate channels, of<lf> the action taken and of any penalties subsequently imposed.<lf>                              Article 74<lf>               Delimitation of the exclusive economic zone<lf>             between States with opposite or adjacent coasts<lf> 1\. The delimitation of the exclusive economic zone between States with<lf> opposite or adjacent coasts shall be effected by agreement on the basis<lf> of international law, as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of<lf> the International Court of Justice, in order to achieve an equitable<lf> solution.<lf> 2\. If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time,<lf> the States concerned shall report to the procedures provided for in<lf> Part XV.<lf> 3\. Pending agreement as provided for in paragraph 1, the States<lf> concerned, in a spirit of understanding and co-operation, shall make<lf> every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical<lf> nature and, during this transitional period, not to jeopardise or<lf> hamper the reaching of the final agreement. Such arrangements shall be<lf> without prejudice to the final delimitation.<lf> 4\. Where there is an agreement in force between the States concerned,<lf> questions relating to the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone<lf> shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of that<lf> agreement.<lf>                              Article 75<lf>               Charts and lists of geographical co-ordinates<lf> 1\. Subject to this Part, the outer limit lines of the exclusive<lf> economic zone and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with<lf> article 74 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for<lf> ascertaining their position. Where appropriate, lists of geographical<lf> co-ordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be<lf> substituted for such outer limit lines or lines of delimitation.<lf> 2\. The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists<lf> of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such<lf> chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<lf>                               PART VI<lf>                          CONTINENTAL SHELF<lf>                              Article 76<lf>                   Definition of the continental shelf<lf> 1\. The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the sea-bed and<lf> subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea<lf> throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer<lf> edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles<lf> from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is<lf> measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend<lf> up to that distance.<lf> 2\. The continental shelf of a coastal State shall not extend beyond the<lf> limits provided for in paragraphs 4 to 6.<lf> 3\. The continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the<lf> land mass of the coastal State, and consists of the sea-bed and subsoil<lf> of the shelf, the slope and the rise. It does not include the deep<lf> ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.<lf> 4.(a) For the purposes of this Convention, the coastal State shall<lf> establish the outer edge of the continental margin wherever the margin<lf> extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the<lf> breadth of the territorial sea is measured, by either:<lf> (i) a line delineated in accordance with paragraph 7 by reference to<lf> the outermost fixed points at each of which the thickness of<lf> sedimentary rocks is at least 1 per cent of the shortest distance from<lf> such point to the foot of the continental slope; or<lf> (ii) a line delineated in accordance with paragraph 7 by reference to<lf> fixed points not more than 60 nautical miles from the foot of the<lf> continental slope.<lf> (b) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the foot of the<lf> continental slope shall be determined as the point of maximum change in<lf> the gradient at its base.<lf> 5\. The fixed points comprising the line of the outer limits of the<lf> continental shelf on the sea-bed, drawn in accordance with paragraph 4<lf> (a) (i) and (ii),either shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the<lf> baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured or<lf> shall not exceed 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath, which<lf> is a line connecting the depth of 2,500 metres.<lf> 6\. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, on submarine ridges,<lf> the outer limit of the continental shelf shall not exceed 350 nautical<lf> miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea<lf> is measured. This paragraph does not apply to submarine elevations that<lf> are natural components of the continental margin, such as its plateaux,<lf> rises, caps, banks and spurs.<lf> 7\. The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its<lf> continental shelf, where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles<lf> from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is<lf> measured, by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length,<lf> connecting fixed points, defined by co-ordinates of latitude and<lf> longitude.<lf> 8\. Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200<lf> nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the<lf> territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to<lf> the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under<lf> Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation. The<lf> Commission shall make recommendations to coastal States on matters<lf> related to the establishment of the outer limits of their continental<lf> shelf. The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the<lf> basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding.<lf> 9\. The coastal State shall deposit with the Secretary-General of the<lf> United Nations charts and relevant information, including geodetic<lf> data, permanently describing the outer limits of its continental shelf.<lf> The Secretary-General shall give due publicity thereto.<lf> 10\. The provisions of this article are without prejudice to the<lf> question of delimitation of the continental shelf between States with<lf> opposite or adjacent coasts.<lf>                              Article 77<lf>                 Rights of the coastal State over the<lf>                          continental shelf<lf> 1\. The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign<lf> rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural<lf> resources.<lf> 2\. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 are exclusive in the sense<lf> that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or<lf> exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities<lf> without the express consent of the coastal State.<lf> 3\. The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not<lf> depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express<lf> proclamation.<lf> 4\. The natural resources referred to in this Part consist of the<lf> mineral and other non-living resources of the sea-bed and subsoil<lf> together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species, that is<lf> to say, organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile<lf> on or under the sea-bed or are unable to move except in constant<lf> physical contact with the sea-bed or the subsoil.<lf>                              Article 78<lf>                Legal status of the superjacent waters<lf>               and air space and the rights and freedoms<lf>                            of other States<lf> 1\. The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not<lf> affect the legal status of the superjacent waters or of the air space<lf> above those waters.<lf> <p>2\. The exercise of the rights of the coastal State over the continental<lf> shelf must not infringe or result in any unjustifiable interference<lf> with navigation and other rights and freedoms of other States as<lf> provided for in this Convention.<lf>                              Article 79<lf>                 Submarine cables and pipelines on the<lf>                          continental shelf<lf> 1\. All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the<lf> continental shelf, in accordance with the provisions of this article.<lf> 2\. Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration<lf> of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and<lf> the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from pipelines, the<lf> coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables<lf> or pipelines.<lf> 3\. The delineation of the course for the laying of such pipelines on<lf> the continental shelf is subject to the consent of the coastal State.<lf> 4\. Nothing in this Part affects the right of the coastal State to<lf> establish conditions for cables or pipelines entering its territory or<lf> territorial sea, or its jurisdiction over cables and pipelines<lf> constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its<lf> continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of<lf> artificial islands, installations and structures under its<lf> jurisdiction.<lf> 5\. When laying submarine cables or pipelines, States shall have due<lf> regard to cables or pipelines already in position. In particular,<lf> possibilities of repairing existing cables or pipelines shall not be<lf> prejudiced.<lf>                              Article 80<lf>                 Artificial islands, installations<lf>              and structures on the continental shelf<lf> Article 60 applies mutatis mutandis to artificial islands,<lf> installations and structures on the continental shelf.<lf>                              Article 81<lf>                    Drilling on the continental shelf<lf> The coastal State shall have the exclusive right to authorize and<lf> regulate drilling on the continental shelf for all purposes.<lf>                              Article 82<lf>               Payments and contributions with respect<lf>                 to the exploitation of the continental<lf>                    shelf beyond 200 nautical miles<lf> 1\. The coastal State shall make payments or contributions in kind in<lf> respect of the exploitation of the non-living resources of the<lf> continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from<lf> which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.<lf> 2\. The payments and contributions shall be made annually with respect<lf> to all production at a site after the first five years of production at<lf> that site. For the sixth year, the rate of payment or contribution<lf> shall be 1 per cent of the value or volume of production at the site.<lf> The rate shall increase by 1 per cent for each subsequent year until<lf> the twelfth year and shall remain at 7 per cent thereafter. Production<lf> does not include resources used in connection with exploitation.<lf> 3\. A developing State which is a net importer of a mineral resource<lf> produced from its continental shelf is exempt from making such payments<lf> or contributions in respect of that mineral resource.<lf> 4\. The payments or contributions shall be made through the Authority,<lf> which shall distribute them to States Parties to this Convention, on<lf> the basis of equitable sharing criteria, taking into account the<lf> interests and needs of developing States, particularly the least<lf> developed and the land-locked among them.<lf>                              Article 83<lf>                 Delimitation of the continental shelf<lf>            between States with opposite or adjacent coasts<lf> 1\. The delimitation of the continental shelf between States with<lf> opposite or adjacent coasts shall be effected by agreement on the basis<lf> of international law, as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of<lf> the International Court of Justice, in order to achieve an equitable<lf> solution.<lf> 2\. If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time,<lf> the States concerned shall resort to the procedures provided for in<lf> Part XV.<lf> 3\. Pending agreement as provided for in paragraph 1, the States<lf> concerned, in a spirit of understanding and co-operation, shall make<lf> every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical<lf> nature and, during this transitional period, not to jeopardise or<lf> hamper the reaching of the final agreement. Such arrangements shall be<lf> without prejudice to the final delimitation.<lf> 4\. Where there is an agreement in force between the States concerned,<lf> questions relating to the delimitation of the continental shelf shall<lf> be determined in accordance with the provisions of that agreement.<lf>                              Article 84<lf>               Charts and lists of geographical co-ordinates<lf> 1\. Subject to this Part, the outer limit lines of the continental shelf<lf> and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with article 83 shall<lf> be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their<lf> position. Where appropriate, lists of geographical co-ordinates of<lf> points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted for such<lf> outer limit lines or lines of delimitation.<lf> 2\. The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists<lf> of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such<lf> chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and, in<lf> the case of those showing the outer limit lines of the continental<lf> shelf, with the Secretary-General of the Authority.<lf>                              Article 85<lf>                              Tunnelling<lf> This Part does not prejudice the right of the coastal State to exploit<lf> the subsoil by means of tunnelling, irrespective of the depth of water<lf> above the subsoil.<lf> </lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf>
