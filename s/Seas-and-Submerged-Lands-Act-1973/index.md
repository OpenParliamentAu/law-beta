## An Act relating to Sovereignty in respect of certain Waters of the Sea and in respect of the Airspace over, and the Sea-bed and Subsoil beneath, those Waters and to Sovereign Rights in respect of the Continental Shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone and to certain rights of control in respect of the Contiguous Zone

Preamble

WHEREAS a belt of sea adjacent to the coast of Australia, known as the territorial sea, and the airspace over the territorial sea and the bed and subsoil of the territorial sea, are within the sovereignty of Australia:

AND WHEREAS Australia as a coastal state has:

        (a)   sovereign rights in respect of the waters, the sea-bed and the subsoil that constitute the exclusive economic zone of Australia for the purposes of:

           (i)  exploring the zone; and

          (ii)  exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources of the zone; and

        (b)   sovereign rights with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the exclusive economic zone of Australia, such as the production of energy from water, currents and winds; and

        (c)   jurisdiction in accordance with international law in relation to:

                (i)  the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations and structures in the exclusive economic zone; and

               (ii)  marine scientific research in the exclusive economic zone; and

              (iii)  the protection and preservation of the marine environment in the exclusive economic zone; and

        (d)   other rights and duties in relation to the exclusive economic zone provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea:

AND WHEREAS Australia as a coastal state has sovereign rights in respect of the continental shelf (that is to say, the sea-bed and subsoil of certain submarine areas adjacent to its coast but outside the area of the territorial sea) for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources:

AND WHEREAS Australia as a coastal state has the right under international law to exercise control within a contiguous zone to:

        (a)   prevent infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws within Australia or the territorial sea of Australia;

        (b)   to punish infringements of those laws:

BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives of Australia, as follows:

                     (b)  by reason that the law makes provision with respect to, or touching or concerning, any sea-bed or subsoil referred to in Division 1 or Division 2 but in respect of which paragraph (a) does not apply, or the living or non-living resources of any such sea-bed or subsoil, if the law is otherwise within powers with respect to particular matters that are conferred on the legislature of the State or of the Northern Territory, as the case may be, by the _Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980_ or the _Coastal Waters (Northern Territory Powers) Act 1980_. 

 


# Schedule—Parts II, V and VI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea

_Subsection 3(1)_

_(definition of “the convention”)_

**PART II**

**TERRITORIAL****SEA****AND CONTIGUOUS ZONE**

_SECTION 1\. GENERAL PROVISIONS_ 

**Article 2**

_Legal status of the territorial sea, of the air space over the territorial sea and of its bed and subsoil_

       1.  The sovereignty of a coastal State extends, beyond its land territory and internal waters and, in the case of an archipelagic State, its archipelagic waters, to an adjacent belt of sea, described as the territorial sea.

       2.  This sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil.

       3.  The sovereignty over the territorial sea is exercised subject to this Convention and to other rules of international law.

_SECTION 2\. LIMITS OF THE__TERRITORIAL__SEA_

**Article 3**

_Breadth of the territorial sea_

       Every State has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles, measured from baselines determined in accordance with this Convention.

**Article 4**

_Outer limit of the territorial sea_

       The outer limit of the territorial sea is the line every point of which is at a distance from the nearest point of the baseline equal to the breadth of the territorial sea. 

**Article 5**

_Normal baseline_

       Except where otherwise provided in this Convention, the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal State.

**Article 6**

_Reefs_

       In the case of islands situated on atolls or of islands having fringing reefs, the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the seaward low-water line of the reef, as shown by the appropriate symbol on charts officially recognized by the coastal State. 

**Article 7**

_Straight baselines_

       1.  In localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. 

       2.  Where because of the presence of a delta and other natural conditions the coastline is highly unstable, the appropriate points may be selected along the furthest seaward extent of the low-water line and, notwithstanding subsequent regression of the low-water line, the straight baselines shall remain effective until changed by the coastal State in accordance with this Convention. 

       3.  The drawing of straight baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the regime of internal waters. 

       4.  Straight baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them or except in instances where the drawing of baselines to and from such elevations has received general international recognition. 

       5.  Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under paragraph 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and the importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage. 

       6.  The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in such a manner as to cut off the territorial sea of another State from the high seas or an exclusive economic zone. 

**Article 8**

_Internal waters_

       1.  Except as provided in Part IV, waters on the landward side of the baseline of the territorial sea form part of the internal waters of the State. 

       2.  Where the establishment of a straight baseline in accordance with the method set forth in article 7 has the effect of enclosing as internal water areas which had not previously been considered as such, a right of innocent passage as provided in this Convention shall exist in those waters. 

**Article 9**

_Mouths of rivers_

       If a river flows directly into the sea, the baseline shall be a straight line across the mouth of the river between points on the low-water line of its banks. 

**Article 10**

_Bays_

       1.  This article relates only to bays the coasts of which belong to a single State. 

       2.  For the purposes of this Convention, a bay is a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation. 

       3.  For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that lying between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation and a line joining the low-water mark of its natural entrance points. Where, because of the presence of islands, an indentation has more than one mouth, the semi-circle shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum total of the lengths of the lines across the different mouths. Islands within an indentation shall be included as if they were part of the water area of the indentation. 

       4.  If the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of a bay does not exceed 24 nautical miles, a closing line may be drawn between these two low-water marks, and the waters enclosed thereby shall be considered as internal waters. 

       5.  Where the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of a bay exceeds 24 nautical miles, a straight baseline of 24 nautical miles shall be drawn within the bay in such a manner as to enclose the maximum area of water that is possible with a line of that length. 

       6.  The foregoing provisions do not apply to so-called “historic” bays, or in any case where the system of straight baselines provided for in article 7 is applied. 

**Article 11**

_Ports_

       For the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the outermost permanent harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system are regarded as forming part of the coast. Off-shore installations and artificial islands shall not be considered as permanent harbour works. 

**Article 12**

_Roadsteads_

       Roadsteads which are normally used for the loading, unloading and anchoring of ships, and which would otherwise be situated wholly or partly outside the outer limit of the territorial sea, are included in the territorial sea. 

**Article 13**

_Low-tide elevations_ 

       1.  A low-tide elevation is a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide. Where a low-tide elevation is situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, the low-water line on that elevation may be used as the baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea. 

       2.  Where a low-tide elevation is wholly situated at a distance exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, it has no territorial sea of its own. 

**Article 14**

_Combination of methods for determining baselines_

       The coastal State may determine baselines in turn by any of the methods provided for in the foregoing articles to suit different conditions. 

**Article 15**

_Delimitation of the territorial sea between States with opposite or adjacent coasts_

       Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two States is measured. The above provision does not apply, however, where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special circumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way in which is at variance therewith. 

**Article 16**

_Charts and lists of geographical co-ordinates_

       1.  The baselines for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea determined in accordance with articles 7, 9 and 10, or the limits derived therefrom, and the lires of delimitation drawn in accordance with articles 12 and 15 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Alternatively, a list of geographical co-ordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted. 

       2.  The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 

_SECTION 3\. INNOCENT PASSAGE IN THE__TERRITORIAL__SEA_

_SUBSECTION A. RULES APPLICABLE TO ALL SHIPS_

**Article 17**

_Right of innocent passage_

       Subject to this Convention, ships of all States, whether coastal or land-locked, enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea. 

**Article 18**

_Meaning of passage_

       1.  Passage means navigation through the territorial sea for the purpose of:

(a)   traversing that sea without entering internal waters or calling at a roadstead or port facility outside internal waters; or 

(b)   proceeding to or from internal waters or a call at such roadstead or port facility. 

       2.  Passage shall be continuous and expeditious. However, passage includes stopping and anchoring, but only in so far as the same are incidental to ordinary navigation or are rendered necessary by force majeure or distress or for the purpose of rendering assistance to persons, ships or aircraft in danger or distress. 

**Article 19**

_Meaning of innocent passage_

       1.  Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. Such passage shall take place in conformity with this Convention and with other rules of international law. 

       2.  Passage of a foreign ship shall be considered to be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State if in the territorial sea it engages in any of the following activities:

(a)   any threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of the coastal State, or in any other manner in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations;

(b)   any exercise or practice with weapons of any kind; 

(c)   any act aimed at collecting information to the prejudice of the defence or security of the coastal State; 

(d)   any act or propaganda aimed at affecting the defence or security of the coastal State; 

(e)   the launching, landing or taking on board of any aircraft; 

(f)   the launching, landing or taking on board of any military device; 

(g)   the loading or unloading of any commodity, currency or person contrary to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal State; 

(h)   any act of wilful and serious pollution contrary to this Convention;

(i)    any fishing activities; 

(j)    the carrying out of research or survey activities; 

(k)   any act aimed at interfering with any systems of communication or any other facilities or installations of the coastal State; 

(l)    any other activity not having a direct bearing on passage. 

**Article 20**

_Submarines and other underwater vehicles_

       In the territorial sea, submarines and other underwater vehicles are required to navigate on the surface and to show their flag. 

**Article 21**

_Laws and regulations of the coastal State relating to innocent passage_

       1.  The coastal State may adopt laws and regulations, in conformity with the provisions of this Convention and other rules of international law, relating to innocent passage through the territorial sea, in respect of all or any of the following: 

(a)   the safety of navigation and the regulation of maritime traffic; 

(b)   the protection of navigational aids and facilities and other facilities or installations;

       2.  The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 

**PART VI**

**CONTINENTAL SHELF**

**Article 76**

_Definition of the continental shelf_

       1.  The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance. 

       2.  The continental shelf of a coastal State shall not extend beyond the limits provided for in paragraphs 4 to 6\. 

       3.  The continental margin comprises the submerged prolongation of the land mass of the coastal State, and consists of the sea-bed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise. It does not include the deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof. 

4\. (a)  For the purposes of this Convention, the coastal State shall establish the outer edge of the continental margin wherever the margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, by either: 

  (i)  a line delineated in accordance with paragraph 7 by reference to the outermost fixed points at each of which the thickness of sedimentary rocks is at least 1 per cent of the shortest distance from such point to the foot of the continental slope; or 

(ii)  a line delineated in accordance with paragraph 7 by reference to fixed points not more than 60 nautical miles from the foot of the continental slope. 

(b)   In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the foot of the continental slope shall be determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base. 

       5.  The fixed points comprising the line of the outer limits of the continental shelf on the sea-bed, drawn in accordance with paragraph 4(a)(i) and (ii), either shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured or shall not exceed 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath, which is a line connecting the depth of 2,500 metres. 

       6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, on submarine ridges, the outer limit of the continental shelf shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. This paragraph does not apply to submarine elevations that are natural components of the continental margin, such as its plateaux, rises, caps, banks and spurs. 

       7.  The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf, where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length, connecting fixed points, defined by co-ordinates of latitude and longitude. 

       8.  Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation. The Commission shall make recommendations to coastal States on matters related to the establishment of the outer limits of their continental shelf. The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding. 

       9.  The coastal State shall deposit with the Secretary-General of the United Nations charts and relevant information, including geodetic data, permanently describing the outer limits of its continental shelf. The Secretary-General shall give due publicity thereto. 

       10\. The provisions of this article are without prejudice to the question of delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts. 

**Article 77**

_Rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf_

       1.  The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources. 

       2.  The rights referred to in paragraph 1 are exclusive in the sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities without the express consent of the coastal State. 

       3.  The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express proclamation. 

       4.  The natural resources referred to in this Part consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the sea-bed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species, that is to say, organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the sea-bed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the sea-bed or the subsoil. 

**Article 78**

_Legal status of the superjacent waters and air space and the rights and freedoms of other States_

       1.  The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not affect the legal status of the superjacent waters or of the air space above those waters. 

       2.  The exercise of the rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf must not infringe or result in any unjustifiable interference with navigation and other rights and freedoms of other States as provided for in this Convention. 

**Article 79**

_Submarine cables and pipelines on the continental shelf_

       1.  All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the continental shelf, in accordance with the provisions of this article. 

       2.  Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf, the exploitation of its natural resources and the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from pipelines, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of such cables or pipelines. 

       3.  The delineation of the course for the laying of such pipelines on the continental shelf is subject to the consent of the coastal State. 

       4.  Nothing in this Part affects the right of the coastal State to establish conditions for cables or pipelines entering its territory or territorial sea, or its jurisdiction over cables and pipelines constructed or used in connection with the exploration of its continental shelf or exploitation of its resources or the operations of artificial islands, installations and structures under its jurisdiction. 

       5.     When laying submarine cables or pipelines, States shall have due regard to cables or pipelines already in position. In particular, possibilities of repairing existing cables or pipelines shall not be prejudiced. 

**Article 80**

_Artificial islands, installations and structures on the continental shelf_

       Article 60 applies _mutatis mutandis_ to artificial islands, installations and structures on the continental shelf. 

**Article 81**

_Drilling on the continental shelf_

       The coastal State shall have the exclusive right to authorize and regulate drilling on the continental shelf for all purposes. 

**Article 82**

_Payments and contributions with respect to the exploitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles_

       1.  The coastal State shall make payments or contributions in kind in respect of the exploitation of the non-living resources of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. 

       2.  The payments and contributions shall be made annually with respect to all production at a site after the first five years of production at that site. For the sixth year, the rate of payment or contribution shall be 1 per cent of the value or volume of production at the site. The rate shall increase by 1 per cent for each subsequent year until the twelfth year and shall remain at 7 per cent thereafter. Production does not include resources used in connection with exploitation. 

       3.  A developing State which is a net importer of a mineral resource produced from its continental shelf is exempt from making such payments or contributions in respect of that mineral resource. 

       4.  The payments or contributions shall be made through the Authority, which shall distribute them to States Parties to this Convention, on the basis of equitable sharing criteria, taking into account the interests and needs of developing States, particularly the least developed and the land-locked among them. 

**Article 83**

_Delimitation of the continental shelf between States with oppositeor adjacent coasts_

       1.  The delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts shall be effected by agreement on the basis of international law, as referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, in order to achieve an equitable solution. 

       2.  If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time, the States concerned shall resort to the procedures provided for in Part XV. 

       3.  Pending agreement as provided for in paragraph 1, the States concerned, in a spirit of understanding and co-operation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature and, during this transitional period, not to jeopardise or hamper the reaching of the final agreement. Such arrangements shall be without prejudice to the final delimitation. 

       4.  Where there is an agreement in force between the States concerned, questions relating to the delimitation of the continental shelf shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of that agreement. 

**Article 84**

_Charts and lists of geographical co-ordinates_

       1.  Subject to this Part, the outer limit lines of the continental shelf and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with article 83 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining their position. Where appropriate, lists of geographical co-ordinates of points, specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted for such outer limit lines or lines of delimitation. 

       2.  The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of geographical co-ordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and, in the case of those showing the outer limit lines of the continental shelf, with the Secretary-General of the Authority. 

**Article 85**

_Tunnelling_

       This Part does not prejudice the right of the coastal State to exploit the subsoil by means of tunnelling, irrespective of the depth of water above the subsoil.

### Note 2

Proclamations made under section 7 of the _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973_ provide as follows:

The territorial sea of Australia is measured from baselines established by Proclamations under section 7 of the _Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973_. These Proclamations are found in _Gazette_ No. S 29, Wednesday, 9 February 1983 and _Gazette_ No. S 57, Tuesday, 31 March 1987\. 

The outer limit of the territorial sea is 12 nautical miles seaward of that baseline (see Proclamation in _Gazette_ No. S 297, Tuesday 13 November 1990).

The outer limit of the exclusive economic zone is 200 nautical miles seaward of that baseline (see Proclamation in _Gazette_ No. S 290, Friday, 29 July 1994).

The outer limit of the contiguous zone is 24 nautical miles seaward of that baseline (see Proclamation in _Gazette_ No. S 148, Wednesday 14 April 1999).
