## SCH
<sch>                                   SCHEDULE  1<lf> Preamble <lf>        CONVENTION  ON  THE  TERRITORIAL  SEA  AND  THE  CONTIGUOUS  ZONE<lf>        The States Parties to this Convention<lf>        Have agreed as follows:<lf>                                            PART  I<lf>                                        TERRITORIAL  SEA<lf>                                       Section I. General<lf>                                           ARTICLE  1<lf>          1\. The sovereignty of a State extends, beyond its land territory and its<lf> internal waters, to a belt of sea adjacent to its coast, described as the<lf> territorial sea.<lf> 

  2\. This sovereignty is exercised subject to the provisions of these articles<lf> and to other rules of international law.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  2<lf>   The sovereignty of a coastal State extends to the air space over the<lf> territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil.<lf> <p>                   Section II. Limits of the territorial sea<lf>                                    ARTICLE  3<lf>   Except where otherwise provided in these articles, the normal baseline for<lf> measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the<lf> coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal<lf> State.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  4<lf>   1\. In localities where the coast line is deeply indented and cut into, or if<lf> there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the<lf> method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in<lf> drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.<lf> <p>  2\. The drawing of such baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent<lf> from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the<lf> lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to<lf> the regime of internal waters.<lf> <p>  3\. Baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless<lf> lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have<lf> been built on them.<lf> <p>  4\. Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under the provisions<lf> of paragraph 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of<lf> economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and the<lf> importance of which are clearly evidenced by a long usage.<lf> <p>  5\. The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in such a<lf> manner as to cut off from the high seas the territorial sea of another State.<lf> <p>  6\. The coastal State must clearly indicate straight baselines on charts, to<lf> which due publicity must be given.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  5<lf>   1\. Waters on the landward side of the baseline of the territorial sea form<lf> part of the internal waters of the State.<lf> <p>  2\. Where the establishment of a straight baseline in accordance with article 4 <lf> has the effect of enclosing as internal waters areas which previously had been<lf> considered as part of the territorial sea or of the high seas, a right of<lf> innocent passage, as provided in articles 14 to 23, shall exist in those waters. <lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 6<lf>   The outer limit of the territorial sea is the line every point of which is at<lf> a distance from the nearest point of the baseline equal to the breadth of the<lf> territorial sea.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 7<lf>   1\. This article relates only to bays the coasts of which belong to a single<lf> State.<lf> <p>  2\. For the purpose of these articles, a bay is a well-marked indentation whose <lf> penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain<lf> landlocked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An<lf> indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large <lf> as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn<lf> across the mouth of that indentation.<lf> <p>  3\. For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that lying<lf> between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation and a line<lf> joining the low-water marks of its natural entrance points. Where, because of<lf> the presence of islands, an indentation has more than one mouth, the semi-circle <lf> shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum total of the lengths of the lines<lf> across the different mouths. Islands within an indentation shall be included as<lf> if they were part of the water areas of the indentation.<lf> <p>  4\. If the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points<lf> of a bay does not exceed twenty-four miles, a closing line may be drawn between<lf> these two low-water marks, and the waters enclosed thereby shall be considered<lf> as internal waters.<lf> <p>  5\. Where the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance<lf> points of a bay exceeds twenty-four miles, a straight baseline of twenty-four<lf> miles shall be drawn within the bay in such a manner as to enclose the maximum<lf> area of water that is possible with a line of that length.<lf> <p>  6\. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to so-called "historic" bays, or<lf> in any case where the straight baseline system provided for in article 4 is<lf> applied.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 8<lf>   For the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the outermost permanent<lf> harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system shall be<lf> regarded as forming part of the coast.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 9<lf>   Roadsteads which are normally used for the loading, unloading and anchoring of <lf> ships, and which would otherwise be situated wholly or partly outside the outer<lf> limit of the territorial sea, are included in the territorial sea. The coastal<lf> State must clearly demarcate such roadsteads and indicate them on charts<lf> together with their boundaries, to which due publicity must be given.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 10<lf>   1\. An island is a naturally-formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is <lf> above water at high-tide.<lf> <p>  2\. The territorial sea of an island is measured in accordance with the<lf> provisions of these articles.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 11<lf>   1\. A low-tide elevation is a naturally-formed area of land which is surrounded <lf> by and above water at low-tide but submerged at high tide. Where a low-tide<lf> elevation is suited wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding the breadth of<lf> the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, the low-water line on that<lf> elevation may be used as the baseline for measuring the breadth of the<lf> territorial sea.<lf> <p>  2\. Where a low-tide elevation is wholly situated at a distance exceeding the<lf> breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, it has no<lf> territorial sea of its own.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 12<lf>   1\. Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other,<lf> neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the<lf> contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the<lf> median line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the<lf> baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two<lf> States is measured. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply, however,<lf> where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special circumstances <lf> to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way which is at variance<lf> with this provision.<lf> <p>  2\. The line of delimitation between the territorial seas of two States lying<lf> opposite to each other or adjacent to each other shall be marked on large-scale<lf> charts officially recognized by the coastal States.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 13<lf>   If a river flows directly into the sea, the baseline shall be a straight line<lf> across the mouth of the river between points on the low-tide line of its banks.<lf> <p>                     Section III. Right of innocent passage<lf>                   Sub-section A. Rules applicable to all ships<lf>                                    ARTICLE 14<lf>   1\. Subject to the provisions of these articles, ships of all States, whether<lf> coastal or not, shall enjoy the right of innocent passage through the<lf> territorial sea.<lf> <p>  2\. Passage means navigation through the territorial sea for the purpose either <lf> of traversing that sea without entering internal waters, or of proceeding to<lf> internal waters, or of making for the high seas from internal waters.<lf> <p>  3\. Passage includes stopping and anchoring, but only in so far as the same are <lf> incidental to ordinary navigation or are rendered necessary by force majeure<lf>  or by distress.<lf> <p>  4\. Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good<lf> order or security of the coastal State. Such passage shall take place in<lf> conformity with these articles and with other rules of international law.<lf> <p>  5\. Passage of foreign fishing vessels shall not be considered innocent if they <lf> do not observe such laws and regulations as the coastal State may make and<lf> publish in order to prevent these vessels from fishing in the territorial sea.<lf> <p>  6\.

The coastal State may take the necessary steps in its territorial sea to<lf> prevent passage which is not innocent.<lf> <p>  2\. In the case of ships proceeding to internal waters, the coastal State shall <lf> also have the right to take the necessary steps to prevent any breach of the<lf> conditions to which admission of those ships to those waters is subject.<lf> <p>  3\. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, the coastal State may, without<lf> discrimination amongst foreign ships, suspend temporarily in specified areas of<lf> its territorial sea the innocent passage of foreign ships if such suspension is<lf> essential for the protection of its security. Such suspension shall take effect<lf> only after having been duly published.<lf> <p>  4\. There shall be no suspension of the innocent passage of foreign ships<lf> through straits which are used for international navigation between one part of<lf> the high seas and another part of the high seas or the territorial sea of a<lf> foreign State.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 17<lf>   Foreign ships exercising the right of innocent passage shall comply with the<lf> laws and regulations enacted by the coastal State in conformity with these<lf> articles and other rules of international law and, in particular, with such laws <lf> and regulations relating to transport and navigation.<lf> <p>               Sub-section B.

<sch>                                    SCHEDULE 2<lf> Preamble <lf>                     CONVENTION  ON  THE  CONTINENTAL  SHELF<lf>   The States Parties to this Convention<lf>   Have agreed as follows:<lf>                                    ARTICLE 1<lf>   For the purpose of these articles, the term "continental shelf" is used as<lf> referring (a) to the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the<lf> coast but outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres or,<lf> beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the<lf> exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas; (b) to the seabed and<lf> subsoil of similar submarine areas adjacent to the coasts of islands.<lf> 

                                   ARTICLE 2<lf>   1\. The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for <lf> the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.<lf> <p>  2\. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this article are exclusive in the<lf> sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or<lf> exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities, or make a<lf> claim to the continental shelf, without the express consent of the coastal<lf> State.<lf> <p>  3\. The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not depend on <lf> occupation, effective or notional, or on any express proclamation.<lf> <p>  4\. The natural resources referred to in these articles consist of the mineral<lf> and other non-living resources of the seabed and subsoil together with living<lf> organisms belonging to sedentary species that is to say, organisms which, at the <lf> harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to<lf> move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 3<lf>   The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not affect the<lf> legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas, or that of the airspace<lf> above those waters.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 4<lf>   Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the<lf> continental shelf and the exploitation of its natural resources, the coastal<lf> State may not impede the laying or maintenance of submarine cables or pipe lines <lf> on the continental shelf.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 5<lf>   1\. The exploration of the continental shelf and the exploitation of its<lf> natural resources must not result in any unjustifiable interference with<lf> navigation, fishing or the conservation of the living resources of the sea, nor<lf> result in any interference with fundamental oceanographic or other scientific<lf> research carried out with the intention of open publication.<lf> <p>  2\.  Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 6 of this article, the<lf> coastal State is entitled to construct and maintain or operate on the<lf> continental shelf installations and other devices necessary for its exploration<lf> and the exploitation of its natural resources, and to establish safety zones<lf> around such installations and devices and to take in those zones measures<lf> necessary for their protection.<lf> <p>  3\.  The safety zones referred to in paragraph 2 of this article may extend to<lf> a distance of 500 metres around the installations and other devices which have<lf> been erected, measured from each point of their outer edge. Ships of all<lf> nationalities must respect these safety zones.<lf> <p>  4\. Such installations and devices, though under the jurisdiction of the<lf> coastal State, do not possess the status of islands. They have no territorial<lf> sea of their own, and their presence does not affect the delimitation of the<lf> territorial sea of the coastal State.<lf> <p>  5\. Due notice must be given of the construction of any such installations, and <lf> permanent means for giving warning of their presence must be maintained. Any<lf> installations which are abandoned or disused must be entirely removed.<lf> <p>  6\. Neither the installations or devices, nor the safety zones around them, may <lf> be established where interference may be caused to the use of recognized sea<lf> lanes essential to international navigation.<lf> <p>  7\. The coastal State is obliged to undertake, in the safety zones, all<lf> appropriate measures for the protection of the living resources of the sea from<lf> harmful agents.<lf> <p>  8\. The consent of the coastal State shall be obtained in respect of any<lf> research concerning the continental shelf and undertaken there. Nevertheless,<lf> the coastal State shall not normally withhold its consent if the request is<lf> submitted by a qualified institution with a view to purely scientific research<lf> into the physical or biological characteristics of the continental shelf,<lf> subject to the proviso that the coastal State shall have the right, if it so<lf> desires, to participate or to be represented in the research, and that in any<lf> event the results shall be published.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE 6<lf>   1\. Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of two or<lf> more States whose coasts are opposite each other, the boundary of the<lf> continental shelf appertaining to such States shall be determined by agreement<lf> between them. In the absence of agreement, and unless another boundary line is<lf> justified by special circumstances, the boundary is the median line, every point <lf> of which is equidistant from the nearest points of the baselines from which the<lf> breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured.<lf> <p>  2\. Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of two<lf> adjacent States, the boundary of the continental shelf shall be determined by<lf> agreement between them. In the absence of agreement, and unless another boundary <lf> line is justified by special circumstances, the boundary shall be determined by<lf> application of the principle of equidistance from the nearest points of the<lf> baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is<lf> measured.<lf> <p>  3\. In delimiting the boundaries of the continental shelf, any lines which are<lf> drawn in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this<lf> article should be defined with reference to charts and geographical features as<lf> they exist at a particular date, and reference should be made to fixed permanent <lf> identifiable points on the land.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  7<lf>   The provisions of these articles shall not prejudice the right of the coastal<lf> State to exploit the subsoil by means of tunnelling irrespective of the depth of <lf> water above the subsoil.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  8<lf>   This Convention shall, until 31 October 1958, be open for signature by all<lf> States Members of the United Nations or of any of the specialized agencies, and<lf> by any other State invited by the General Assembly of the United Nations to<lf> become a Party to the Convention.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  9<lf>   This Convention is subject to ratification. The instruments of ratification<lf> shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  10<lf>   This Convention shall be open for accession by any States belonging to any of<lf> the categories mentioned in article 8\. The instruments of accession shall be<lf> deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  11<lf>   1\. This Convention shall come into force on the thirtieth day following the<lf> date of deposit of the twenty-second instrument of ratification or accession<lf> with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<lf> <p>  2\. For each State ratifying or acceding to the Convention after the deposit of <lf> the twenty-second instrument of ratification or accession, the Convention shall<lf> enter into force on the thirtieth day after deposit by such State of its<lf> instrument of ratification or accession.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  12<lf>   1\. At the time of signature, ratification or accession, any State may make<lf> reservations to articles of the Convention other than to articles 1 to 3<lf> inclusive.<lf> <p>  2\. Any Contracting State making a reservation in accordance with the preceding <lf> paragraph may at any time withdraw the reservation by a communication to that<lf> effect addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  13<lf>   1\. After the expiration of a period of five years from the date on which this<lf> Convention shall enter into force, a request for the revision of this Convention <lf> may be made at any time by any Contracting Party by means of a notification in<lf> writing addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<lf> <p>  2\. The General Assembly of the United Nations shall decide upon the steps, if<lf> any, to be taken in respect of such request.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  14<lf>   The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall inform all States Members of <lf> the United Nations and the other States referred to in article 8:<lf>   (a)  Of signatures to this Convention and of the deposit of instruments of<lf>        ratification or accession, in accordance with articles 8, 9 and 10;<lf>          (b)  Of the date on which this Convention will come into force, in accordance<lf>        with article 11;<lf>          (c)  Of requests for revision in accordance with article 13;<lf>          (d)  Of reservations to this Convention, in accordance with article 12.<lf>  <p>                                         ARTICLE  15<lf>   The original of this Convention, of which the Chinese, English, French,<lf> Russian and Spanish texts are equally authentic, shall be deposited with the<lf> Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall send certified copies thereof <lf> to all States referred to in article 8.<lf> <p>  IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, being duly authorized <lf> thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Convention.<lf> <p>  DONE at Geneva, this twenty-ninth day of April one thousand nine hundred and<lf> fifty-eight.<lf> <p>  (Here follow the signatures of the plenipotentiaries, including the<lf> plenipotentiary of Australia.)<lf> </lf></lf></p></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf></lf></lf></p></lf></lf></lf>
