                     (c)  to impose requirements for the secure storage and destruction of records, and the making of reports, in connection with surveillance device operations.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Relationship to other laws and matters

             (1)  Except where there is express provision to the contrary, this Act is not intended to affect any other law of the Commonwealth, any law of a State, or any law of a self‑governing Territory, that prohibits or regulates the use of surveillance devices.

             (3)  This Act is not intended to limit a discretion that a court has:

                     (b)  to stay criminal proceedings in the interests of justice.

             (4)  For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that a warrant may be issued, or an emergency authorisation or tracking device authorisation given, under this Act for the installation, use, maintenance or retrieval of a surveillance device in relation to a relevant offence or a recovery order.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Schedule(s)

### Division 2—Surveillance device warrants

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Application for surveillance device warrant

             (1)  A law enforcement officer (or another person on his or her behalf) may apply for the issue of a surveillance device warrant if the law enforcement officer suspects on reasonable grounds that:

                     (a)  one or more relevant offences have been, are being, are about to be, or are likely to be, committed; and

                     (b)  an investigation into those offences is being, will be, or is likely to be, conducted; and

                     (c)  the use of a surveillance device is necessary in the course of that investigation for the purpose of enabling evidence to be obtained of the commission of the relevant offences or the identity or location of the offenders.

             (2)  If the application is being made by or on behalf of a State or Territory law enforcement officer, the reference in subsection (1) to a relevant offence does not include a reference to a State offence that has a federal aspect.

             (3)  A law enforcement officer (or another person on his or her behalf) may apply for the issue of a surveillance device warrant if:

                     (a)  a recovery order is in force; and

                     (b)  the law enforcement officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the use of a surveillance device may assist in the location and safe recovery of the child to whom the recovery order relates.

          (3A)  A law enforcement officer (or another person on his or her behalf) may apply for the issue of a surveillance device warrant if he or she:

                     (a)  is authorised to do so under a mutual assistance authorisation; and

                     (b)  suspects on reasonable grounds that the use of a surveillance device is necessary, in the course of the investigation or investigative proceeding to which the authorisation relates, for the purpose of enabling evidence to be obtained of:

                              (i)  the commission of the offence to which the authorisation relates; or

                             (ii)  the identity or location of the persons suspected of committing the offence.

             (4)  The application under subsection (1), (3) or (3A) may be made to an eligible Judge or to a nominated AAT member.

             (5)  An application:

                     (a)  must specify:

                              (i)  the name of the applicant; and

                             (ii)  the nature and duration of the warrant sought, including the kind of surveillance device or devices sought to be authorised; and

                     (b)  subject to this section, must be supported by an affidavit setting out the grounds on which the warrant is sought.

             (6)  If a law enforcement officer believes that:

                     (a)  the immediate use of a surveillance device is necessary for a purpose referred to in paragraph (1)(c) or may assist as described in paragraph (3)(b); and

                     (b)  it is impracticable for an affidavit to be prepared or sworn before an application for a warrant is made;

                     (a)  provide as much information as the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member considers is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and

                     (b)  not later than 72 hours after the making of the application, send a duly sworn affidavit to the Judge or member, whether or not a warrant has been issued.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Remote application

             (2)  If transmission by fax is available and an affidavit has been prepared, the person applying must transmit a copy of the affidavit, whether sworn or unsworn, to the eligible Judge or to the nominated AAT member who is to determine the application.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Determining the application

             (1)  An eligible Judge or a nominated AAT member may issue a surveillance device warrant if satisfied:

                   (ba)  in the case of a warrant sought in relation to a mutual assistance authorisation—that such an authorisation is in force and that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion founding the application for the warrant; and

                     (c)  in the case of an unsworn application—that it would have been impracticable for an affidavit to have been sworn or prepared before the application was made; and

                     (d)  in the case of a remote application—that it would have been impracticable for the application to have been made in person.

                     (d)  the existence of any alternative means of obtaining the evidence or information sought to be obtained; and

                     (e)  in the case of a warrant sought in relation to a relevant offence or a recovery order—the likely evidentiary or intelligence value of any evidence or information sought to be obtained; and

                    (ea)  in the case of a warrant sought in relation to a mutual assistance authorisation—the likely evidentiary or intelligence value of any evidence or information sought to be obtained, to the extent that this is possible to determine from information obtained from the foreign country to which the authorisation relates; and

             (3)  Subject to this section, the application must be supported by an affidavit setting out the grounds on which the retrieval warrant is sought.

             (4)  If a law enforcement officer believes that:

                     (a)  the immediate retrieval of a surveillance device is necessary; and

                     (b)  it is impracticable for an affidavit to be prepared or sworn before the application for a retrieval warrant is made;

the application may be made before an affidavit is prepared or sworn.

             (5)  If subsection (4) applies, the applicant must:

                     (a)  provide as much information as the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member considers is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and

                     (b)  not later than 72 hours following the making of the application, send a duly sworn affidavit to the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member who determined the application, whether or not a warrant has been issued.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Remote application

             (1)  If a law enforcement officer believes that it is impracticable for an application for a retrieval warrant to be made in person, the application may be made under section 22 by telephone, fax, e‑mail or any other means of communication.

             (2)  If transmission by fax is available and an affidavit has been prepared, the person applying must transmit a copy of the affidavit, whether sworn or unsworn, to the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member who is to determine the application.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Determining the application

             (1)  An eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may issue a retrieval warrant if the Judge or member is satisfied:

                     (a)  that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion founding the application for the warrant; and

                     (b)  in the case of an unsworn application—that it would have been impracticable for an affidavit to have been sworn or prepared before the application was made; and

                     (c)  in the case of a remote application—that it would have been impracticable for the application to have been made in person.

             (2)  In determining whether a retrieval warrant should be issued, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member must have regard to:

                     (a)  the extent to which the privacy of any person is likely to be affected; and

                     (b)  the public interest in retrieving the device sought to be retrieved.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  What must a retrieval warrant contain?

             (1)  A retrieval warrant must:

                     (a)  state that the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member is satisfied of the matters referred to in subsection 24(1) and has had regard to the matters referred to in subsection 24(2); and

             (3)  As soon as practicable after completing and signing a warrant issued on a remote application, the person issuing it must:

                     (a)  inform the applicant of:

                              (i)  the terms of the warrant; and

                             (ii)  the date on which and the time at which the warrant was issued; and

                     (b)  give the warrant to the applicant while retaining a copy of the warrant for the person’s own record.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  What a retrieval warrant authorises

             (1)  A retrieval warrant (subject to any conditions specified in it) authorises:

                     (a)  the retrieval of the surveillance device specified in the warrant and any enhancement equipment in relation to the device; and

                     (b)  the entry, by force if necessary, onto the premises where the surveillance device is reasonably believed to be, and onto other premises adjoining or providing access to those premises, for the purpose of retrieving the device and equipment; and

                     (c)  the breaking open of any thing for the purpose of retrieving the device and equipment; and

                     (d)  if the device or equipment is installed on or in an object or vehicle—the temporary removal of the object or vehicle from any place where it is situated for the purpose of retrieving the device and equipment and returning the object or vehicle to that place; and

                     (e)  the provision of assistance or technical expertise to the law enforcement officer named in the warrant in the retrieval of the device or equipment.

             (2)  If the retrieval warrant authorises the retrieval of a tracking device, the warrant also authorises the use of the tracking device and any enhancement equipment in relation to the device solely for the purposes of the location and retrieval of the device or equipment.

             (3)  A retrieval warrant may authorise the doing of anything reasonably necessary to conceal the fact that anything has been done in relation to the retrieval of a surveillance device or enhancement equipment under the warrant but cannot authorise the use, for any purpose, of the surveillance device specified in the warrant.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Revocation of retrieval warrant

             (1)  A retrieval warrant may, by instrument in writing, be revoked by an eligible Judge or a nominated AAT member on his or her own initiative at any time before the expiration of the period of validity specified in the warrant.

             (2)  If the chief officer of the law enforcement agency to which the law enforcement officer to whom a retrieval warrant was issued belongs or is seconded is satisfied that the grounds for issue of the retrieval warrant no longer exist—the chief officer must, by instrument in writing, revoke the warrant.

             (3)  The instrument revoking a warrant must be signed by the eligible Judge, the nominated AAT member or the chief officer of the law enforcement agency, as the case requires.

             (4)  If an eligible Judge or nominated AAT member revokes a warrant, he or she must give a copy of the instrument of revocation to the chief officer of the law enforcement agency to which the law enforcement officer to whom the warrant was issued belongs or is seconded.

             (5)  If the law enforcement officer to whom a retrieval warrant has been issued, or who is primarily responsible for executing a retrieval warrant, believes that the grounds for issue of the warrant no longer exist, he or she must inform the chief officer of the law enforcement agency immediately.

## Part 3—Emergency authorisations

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Emergency authorisation—serious risks to person or property

             (1)  A law enforcement officer may apply to an appropriate authorising officer for an emergency authorisation for the use of a surveillance device if, in the course of an investigation of a relevant offence, the law enforcement officer reasonably suspects that:

                     (a)  an imminent risk of serious violence to a person or substantial damage to property exists; and

                     (b)  the use of a surveillance device is immediately necessary for the purpose of dealing with that risk; and

                     (c)  the circumstances are so serious and the matter is of such urgency that the use of a surveillance device is warranted; and

                     (d)  it is not practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

             (2)  If the application is being made by or on behalf of a State or Territory law enforcement officer, the reference in that subsection to a relevant offence does not include a reference to a State offence that has a federal aspect.

             (3)  The application may be made orally, in writing or by telephone, fax, e‑mail or any other means of communication.

             (4)  The appropriate authorising officer may give the emergency authorisation if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion founding the application.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Emergency authorisation—urgent circumstances relating to recovery order

                              (i)  the circumstances are so urgent as to warrant the immediate use of a surveillance device; and

                             (ii)  it is not practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

             (2)  The application may be made orally, in writing or by telephone, fax, e‑mail or any other means of communication.

             (3)  The appropriate authorising officer may give the emergency authorisation if satisfied that the recovery order is in force and that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion founding the application.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Emergency authorisation—risk of loss of evidence

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a law enforcement officer is conducting an investigation into:

                             (ii)  an offence against section 233BAA of the _Customs Act 1901_ (with respect to goods listed in Schedule 4 to the _Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956_ or in Schedule 8 or 9 to the _Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958_); or

                            (iv)  an offence under the _Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990_ or an offence against Part 9.1 of the _Criminal Code_ (other than section 308.1 or 308.2); or

                     (b)  the law enforcement officer reasonably suspects that:

                              (i)  the use of the surveillance device is immediately necessary to prevent the loss of any evidence relevant to that investigation; and

                             (ii)  the circumstances are so serious and the matter is of such urgency that the use of the surveillance device is warranted; and

                            (iii)  it is not practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant;

the law enforcement officer may apply to an appropriate authorising officer for an emergency authorisation for the use of a surveillance device.

             (2)  The application may be made orally, in writing or by telephone, fax, e‑mail or any other means of communication.

             (3)  The appropriate authorising officer may give the emergency authorisation if satisfied that:

                     (a)  an investigation is being conducted into an offence referred to in paragraph (1)(a); and

                     (b)  there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion referred to in paragraph (1)(b).

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Record of emergency authorisations to be made

                     (a)  the name of the applicant for the authorisation; and

                     (b)  the date and time the authorisation was given; and

                     (c)  the nature of the authorisation given.

             (2)  A written record made under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Attributes of emergency authorisations

             (1)  An emergency authorisation may authorise the law enforcement officer to whom it is given:

                     (a)  to use more than one kind of surveillance device; and

                     (b)  to use more than one surveillance device of any particular kind.

             (2)  An emergency authorisation may authorise anything that a surveillance device warrant may authorise.

             (3)  A law enforcement officer may use a surveillance device under an emergency authorisation only if he or she is acting in the performance of his or her duty.

             (4)  Nothing in this Part authorises the doing of anything for which a warrant would be required under the _Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979._

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Application for approval of emergency authorisation

             (1)  Within 48 hours after giving an emergency authorisation to a law enforcement officer, the appropriate authorising officer who gave the authorisation (or another person on that appropriate authorising officer’s behalf) must apply to an eligible Judge or to a nominated AAT member for approval of the giving of the emergency authorisation.

             (2)  The application:

                     (a)  must specify:

                              (i)  the name of the applicant for the approval; and

                     (b)  must be supported by an affidavit setting out the grounds on which the approval (and warrant, if any) is sought; and

                     (c)  must be accompanied by a copy of the written record made under section 31 in relation to the emergency authorisation.

             (3)  The eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may refuse to consider the application until the applicant gives the Judge or member all the information the Judge or member requires about the application in the way the Judge or member requires.

             (4)  An application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation and any instrument in support of such an application is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Consideration of application

             (1)  Before deciding an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation given under section 28, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member considering the application must, in particular, and being mindful of the intrusive nature of using a surveillance device, consider the following:

                     (a)  the nature of the risk of serious violence to a person or substantial damage to property;

                     (b)  the extent to which issuing a surveillance device warrant would have helped reduce or avoid the risk;

                     (c)  the extent to which law enforcement officers could have used alternative methods of investigation to help reduce or avoid the risk;

                     (d)  how much the use of alternative methods of investigation could have helped reduce or avoid the risk;

                     (e)  how much the use of alternative methods of investigation would have prejudiced the safety of the person or property because of delay or for another reason;

                      (f)  whether or not it was practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

             (2)  Before deciding an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation given under section 29, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member considering the application must, in particular, and being mindful of the intrusive nature of using a surveillance device, consider the following:

                     (a)  the urgency of enforcing the recovery order;

                     (b)  the extent to which use of a surveillance device would assist in the location and safe recovery of the child to whom the recovery order relates;

                     (c)  the extent to which law enforcement officers could have used alternative methods to assist in the location and safe recovery of the child;

                     (d)  how much the use of alternative methods to assist in the location and safe recovery of the child might have prejudiced the effective enforcement of the recovery order;

                     (e)  whether or not it was practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

             (3)  Before deciding an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation given under section 30, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member must, in particular, and being mindful of the intrusive nature of using a surveillance device, consider the following:

                     (a)  the nature of the risk of the loss of evidence;

                     (b)  the extent to which issuing a surveillance device warrant would have helped reduce or avoid the risk;

                     (c)  the extent to which law enforcement officers could have used alternative methods of investigation to help reduce or avoid the risk;

                     (d)  how much the use of alternative methods of investigation could have helped reduce or avoid the risk;

                     (e)  whether or not it was practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Judge or nominated AAT member may approve giving of emergency authorisations

             (1)  After considering an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation under section 28, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may approve the application if satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that:

                     (a)  there was a risk of serious violence to a person or substantial damage to property; and

                     (b)  using a surveillance device may have helped reduce the risk; and

                     (c)  it was not practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

             (2)  After considering an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation under section 29 in relation to a recovery order, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may approve the application if satisfied that:

                     (a)  the recovery order was in force at the time the emergency authorisation was given; and

                     (b)  there were reasonable grounds to suspect that:

                              (i)  the enforcement of the recovery order was urgent; and

                             (ii)  using a surveillance device may have assisted in the prompt location and safe recovery of the child to whom the order relates; and

                            (iii)  it was not practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

             (3)  After considering an application for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation under section 30, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may approve the application if satisfied that:

                     (a)  there were reasonable grounds to suspect that:

                              (i)  there was a risk of loss of evidence; and

                             (ii)  using the surveillance device may have helped reduce the risk; and

                     (b)  it was not practicable in the circumstances to apply for a surveillance device warrant.

             (4)  If, under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member approves the giving of an emergency authorisation, the Judge or member may:

                     (a)  unless paragraph (b) applies—issue a surveillance device warrant for the continued use of the surveillance device as if the application for the approval were an application for a surveillance device warrant under Division 2 of Part 2; or

                     (b)  if the Judge or member is satisfied that since the application for the emergency authorisation the activity that required surveillance has ceased—order that the use of the surveillance device cease.

             (5)  If, under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member does not approve the giving of an emergency authorisation, the Judge or member may:

                     (a)  order that the use of the surveillance device cease; or

                     (b)  if the Judge or member is of the view that although the situation did not warrant the emergency authorisation at the time that authorisation was given, the use of a surveillance device warrant under Division 2 of Part 2 is currently justified—issue a surveillance device warrant for the subsequent use of such a device as if the application for the approval were an application for a surveillance device warrant under Division 2 of Part 2.

             (6)  In any case, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member may order that any information obtained from or relating to the exercise of powers under the emergency authorisation, or any record of that information, be dealt with in a manner specified in the order, not being a manner that involves the destruction of that information.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Admissibility of evidence

                   If the giving of an emergency authorisation is approved under section 35, any evidence obtained because of the exercise of powers under that authorisation is not inadmissible in any proceeding only because the evidence was obtained before the approval.

## Part 4—Use of certain surveillance devices without warrant

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Use of optical surveillance devices without warrant

             (1)  A federal law enforcement officer acting in the course of his or her duties may, without warrant, use an optical surveillance device for any purpose:

                    (aa)  if the officer belongs or is seconded to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity—that is within the functions of the Integrity Commissioner set out in section 15 of the _Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006_; or

                     (b)  if the officer belongs or is seconded to the Australian Crime Commission—that is within the functions of the Commission set out in section 7A of the _Australian Crime Commission Act 2002_;

if the use of that device does not involve:

                     (c)  entry onto premises without permission; or

                     (d)  interference without permission with any vehicle or thing.

             (2)  A State or Territory law enforcement officer acting in the course of his or her duties may, without warrant, use an optical surveillance device in the investigation of a relevant offence (other than a State offence that has a federal aspect) if the use of that device does not involve:

                     (a)  entry onto premises without permission; or

                     (b)  interference without permission with any vehicle or thing.

             (3)  A State or Territory law enforcement officer acting in the course of his or her duties may, without warrant, use an optical surveillance device in the location and safe recovery of a child to whom a recovery order relates if the use of that device does not involve:

                     (a)  a trespass on premises; or

                     (b)  interference without permission with any vehicle or thing.

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Use of surveillance devices without warrant for listening to or recording words in limited circumstances

             (1)  A federal law enforcement officer acting in the course of his or her duties may, without warrant, use a surveillance device for any purpose involving listening to, or recording, words spoken by a person:

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Use and retrieval of tracking devices without warrant in certain circumstances

             (1)  A law enforcement officer may, with the written permission of an appropriate authorising officer, use a tracking device without a warrant in the investigation of a relevant offence.

             (2)  If the law enforcement officer referred to in subsection (1) is a State or Territory law enforcement officer, the reference in subsection (1) to a relevant offence does not include a reference to a State offence that has a federal aspect.

             (3)  A law enforcement officer may, with the written permission of an appropriate authorising officer, use a tracking device without a warrant in the location and safe recovery of a child to whom a recovery order relates.

             (4)  Subsections (1) and (3) have effect despite any other law of the Commonwealth or of a State or self‑governing Territory (including any principle of the common law) forbidding the use of such a device without a warrant.

             (5)  A tracking device authorisation given under subsection (1) or (3) may authorise the law enforcement officer to use more than one tracking device.

             (6)  If an appropriate authorising officer gives a tracking device authorisation under this section, an appropriate authorising officer may also authorise the retrieval, without a warrant, of a tracking device to which the tracking device authorisation relates.

             (8)  An appropriate authorising officer must not give permission under this section for the use, installation or retrieval of a tracking device if the installation of the device, or its retrieval, involves entry onto premises without permission or an interference with the interior of a vehicle without permission.

Note:          Section 22 deals with applications for a retrieval warrant in respect of a tracking device that was lawfully installed under a tracking device authorisation.

             (9)  For the purposes of obtaining the permission of an appropriate authorising officer, the law enforcement officer wishing to use that device:

                     (a)  must apply, orally or in writing, to the appropriate authorising officer; and

                     (b)  must address, in that application, the matters that would be required to be addressed if the law enforcement officer were making an application for a surveillance device warrant or a retrieval warrant, as the case requires.

           (10)  Subsection 18(1), subparagraphs 18(2)(a)(i), 18(2)(b)(i) and 18(2)(c)(i), paragraphs 18(3)(a), (b) and (g) and subsections 18(4), (6) and (7) apply in relation to a tracking device authorisation authorising the use of a tracking device as if:

                     (a)  references in those provisions to a surveillance device warrant were references to a tracking device authorisation authorising the use of a tracking device; and

                     (b)  references in those provisions to a surveillance device were references to a tracking device.

           (11)  Paragraphs 26(1)(a), (c), (d) and (e) and subsections 26(2) and (3) apply in relation to a tracking device authorisation authorising the retrieval of a tracking device as if:

                     (a)  references in those provisions to a retrieval warrant were references to a tracking device authorisation authorising the retrieval of a tracking device; and

                     (b)  references in those provisions to a surveillance device were references to a tracking device.

           (12)  A law enforcement officer may use a tracking device authorisation only if he or she is acting in the performance of his or her duty.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Record of tracking device authorisations to be kept

             (1)  As soon as practicable after an appropriate authorising officer gives a tracking device authorisation, the officer must make a written record of the giving of that authorisation, including in the record:

                     (a)  the name of the applicant for the authorisation; and

                     (b)  the date and time the authorisation was given; and

                     (c)  if the authorisation authorises the use of a tracking device in relation to the investigation of an alleged relevant offence or offences—the alleged offence or offences in respect of which the authorisation is given; and

                     (d)  if the authorisation authorises the use of a tracking device in relation to a recovery order—the date the order was made and the name of the child to whom the order relates; and

                      (f)  if the authorisation authorises the use of a tracking device on a vehicle or class of vehicle—the vehicle or class of vehicle on which the use of the tracking device is authorised; and

                     (g)  if the authorisation authorises the use of a tracking device in respect of the conversations, activities or geographical location of a person—the name of the person (if known); and

                     (h)  if the authorisation authorises the retrieval of a tracking device—the premises or object from which the tracking device is to be retrieved; and

                      (i)  the name of the law enforcement officer primarily responsible for executing the authorisation; and

                      (j)  any conditions subject to which a tracking device may be used, under the authorisation.

## Part 5—Extraterritorial operation of warrants

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Definitions

             (1)  In this Part:

                    <a name=""></a><a name="appropri-consent-offici"></a>**_appropriate consenting official_**, in relation to a foreign country, means an official of that country having authority in that country to give consent to the use of surveillance devices in that country or on a vessel or aircraft registered under the laws of that country.

                    <a name="australian-fish-zone"></a>**_Australian fishing zone_** means the Australian fishing zone within the meaning of the _Fisheries Management Act 1991._

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Extraterritorial operation of warrants

             (1)  If, before the issue of a warrant in relation to the investigation of a relevant offence on an application made by or on behalf of a federal law enforcement officer, it becomes apparent to the applicant that there will be a need for surveillance:

                     (a)  in a foreign country; or

                     (b)  on a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the law of a foreign country and is in or above waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia;

to assist in that investigation, the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member considering the application for the warrant must not permit the warrant to authorise that surveillance unless the Judge or member is satisfied that the surveillance has been agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  application is made under section 33 by an appropriate authorising officer who is a federal law enforcement officer for approval of the giving of an emergency authorisation relating to the investigation of a relevant offence; and

                     (b)  before the completion of consideration of that application, it becomes apparent to the applicant that there will be a need for surveillance:

                              (i)  in a foreign country; or

                             (ii)  on a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the law of a foreign country and is in or above waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia;

                            to assist in the investigation to which the emergency authorisation related;

the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member to whom the application was made must not permit any warrant issued on consideration of that application to authorise that surveillance unless the Judge or member is satisfied that the surveillance has been agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a warrant has been issued in relation to the investigation of a relevant offence on an application by or on behalf of a federal law enforcement officer; and

                     (b)  after the issue of the warrant it becomes apparent to the law enforcement officer primarily responsible for executing the warrant that there will be a need for surveillance:

                              (i)  in a foreign country; or

                             (ii)  on a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the law of a foreign country and is in or above waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia;

                            to assist in that investigation;

the warrant is taken to permit that surveillance if, and only if, the surveillance has been agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country.

             (4)  Despite subsections (1), (2) and (3), if:

                     (a)  a vessel that is registered under the law of a foreign country is in waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia but not beyond the outer limits of the contiguous zone of Australia; and

                     (b)  the relevant offence in respect of which it becomes apparent that surveillance on the vessel will be required is an offence relating to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws of Australia;

there is no requirement for the agreement of an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country concerned in relation to that surveillance while the vessel is in such waters.

             (5)  Despite subsections (1), (2) and (3), if:

                     (a)  a vessel that is registered under the law of a foreign country is in waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia but not beyond the outer limits of the Australian fishing zone; and

                     (b)  the relevant offence in respect of which it becomes apparent that surveillance on the vessel will be required is an offence against section 100, 100A, 100B, 101, 101A or 101AA of the _Fisheries Management Act 1991_ or section 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D, 49A or 51A of the _Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984_;

there is no requirement for the agreement of an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country concerned in relation to that surveillance while the vessel is in those waters.

             (6)  As soon as practicable after the commencement of surveillance under the authority of a warrant:

                     (a)  in a foreign country; or

                     (b)  in circumstances where consent to that surveillance is required—on a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the law of a foreign country;

the chief officer of the law enforcement agency to which the law enforcement officer who applied for the warrant belongs or is seconded must give the Minister evidence in writing that the surveillance has been agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country.

             (7)  An instrument providing evidence of the kind referred to in subsection (6) is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

             (8)  If a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the laws of a foreign country is in or above the territorial sea of another foreign country, subsections (1), (2) and (3) have effect as if the reference to an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country were a reference to an appropriate consenting official of each foreign country concerned.

             (9)  For the avoidance of doubt, there is no requirement for the agreement of an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country to the surveillance under the authority of a warrant of a vessel or aircraft of a foreign country that is in Australia or in or above waters within the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Evidence obtained from extraterritorial surveillance not to be tendered in evidence unless court satisfied properly obtained

                   Evidence obtained from surveillance undertaken in a foreign country in accordance with subsection 42(1), (2) or (3) in relation to a relevant offence cannot be tendered in evidence to a court in any proceedings relating to the relevant offence unless the court is satisfied that the surveillance was agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country.

             (5)  A certificate must not be admitted in evidence under subsection (2) in prosecution proceedings unless the person charged or a solicitor who has appeared for the person in those proceedings has, at least 14 days before the certificate is sought to be so admitted, been given a copy of the certificate together with reasonable evidence of the intention to produce the certificate as evidence in those proceedings.

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), if, under subsection (2), a certificate is admitted in evidence in prosecution proceedings, the person charged may require the person giving the certificate to be called as a witness for the prosecution and cross‑examined as if he or she had given evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.

             (7)  Subsection (6) does not entitle the person charged to require the person giving a certificate to be called as a witness for the prosecution unless the court before which the prosecution proceedings are brought, by order, allows the person charged to require the person giving the certificate to be so called.

             (8)  Any evidence given in support, or in rebuttal, of a matter stated in a certificate given under subsection (2) or (3) must be considered on its merits and the credibility and probative value of such evidence must be neither increased nor diminished by reason of this section.
