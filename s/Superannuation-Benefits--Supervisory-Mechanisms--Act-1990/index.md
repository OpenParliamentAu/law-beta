## SECT
<sect>   7\. (1) Any act done in relation to the provision of superannuation benefits that contravenes section 5 is void to the extent that it contravenes that section. 

  (2) Any act done in relation to the provision of superannuation benefits under, or purportedly under, a superannuation arrangement approved by the Minister under section 5, that contravenes the terms and conditions of the arrangement as so approved is void to the extent that it contravenes those terms and conditions. 

  (3) Where, because of the operation of subsection (1) or (2), the payment of money by a person or body to another person or body is void, then, unless the Minister has declared in writing that this subsection does not apply:<lf>   (a) the money so paid is recoverable as a debt due to the person or body who paid it; and<lf>   (b) if the person or body who paid the money is the employer and the Minister has directed that person or body, by notice in writing, to take action to recover it - the person or body must take action to recover it accordingly. <p>  (4) Where, because of the operation of subsection 5 (4), (5), (6) or (10), a superannuation arrangement, or an amendment of a superannuation arrangement, is of no force or effect, the Minister may, after having regard to the consequences to persons receiving, or likely to receive, benefits under the arrangement, by determination in writing:<lf>   (a) declare the arrangement or amendment, and all or any actions associated with its establishment, making or operation, to have the same force and effect as if it had made provision for, or constituted the provision of, superannuation benefits in accordance with the requirements of this Act; or<lf>   (b) declare the arrangement or amendment, and all or any actions associated with its establishment, making or operation, to have the force and effect referred to in paragraph (a) if the employer concerned, within a period specified in the determination, takes, to the satisfaction of the Minister, such action in relation to the arrangement or amendment as is specified in the determination, being action that, in the opinion of the Minister:<lf>     (i) will most effectively modify the operation of the arrangement<lf> or amendment so that its effect will be substantially similar to the effect it would have had if it had made provision for, or constituted the provision of, superannuation benefits in accordance with the requirements of this Act;
