Section 63 does not apply

             (3)  Section 63 (withdrawal of account balance of less than $200 where individual has ceased to be employed by depositor) does not apply to an individual’s account to the extent that the balance in the account represents deposits made under this Part.

Interpretation

             (4)  A reference in this section to the balance of an individual’s account to the extent to which it represents deposits made under this Part is a reference to that balance to the extent to which it represents:
