##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Imposition Act 1997_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Interpretation

                   Expressions used in this Act that are defined by the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_ have the same meanings as in that Act.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Imposition of superannuation contributions surcharge

                   The superannuation contributions surcharge that is payable on a member’s surchargeable contributions for a financial year under the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_ is imposed by this Act.

Note:          Surcharge is not payable for the financial year that began on 1 July 2005 or a later financial year—see subsection 8(1) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Rate of superannuation contributions surcharge

          (1A)  In this section:

                    <a name="higher-incom-amount"></a>**_higher income amount_** means:

                     (a)  for the 2003‑2004 financial year—$114,981; and

                     (b)  for the 2004‑2005 financial year—that amount as indexed under section 7.

                    <a name="lower-incom-amount"></a>**_lower income amount_** means:

                     (a)  for the 2003‑2004 financial year—$94,691; and

                     (b)  for the 2004‑2005 financial year—that amount as indexed under section 7.

                    <a name="maximum-surcharg-percentag"></a>**_maximum surcharge percentage_** means:

                     (a)  for the 2003‑2004 financial year—14.5%; and

                     (b)  for the 2004‑2005 financial year—12.5%.

             (1)  Unless subsection (4) applies, if the member’s adjusted taxable income for a financial year (**_relevant adjusted taxable income_**) is not less than the lower income amount but is less than the higher income amount, the rate of the superannuation contributions surcharge that applies to the member for that year is the percentage (calculated to 5 decimal places) of the member’s surchargeable contributions for that year worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00533/Html/b15dc0f7-ce7b-4d9d-b3e8-5030d22e40e5_files/image002.gif)

where:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00533/Html/b15dc0f7-ce7b-4d9d-b3e8-5030d22e40e5_files/image003.gif)

             (2)  If the percentage calculated under subsection (1) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 6 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.00001.

             (3)  If the member’s adjusted taxable income for a financial year is equal to, or greater than, the higher income amount, the rate of the superannuation contributions surcharge that applies to the member for that year is the maximum surcharge percentage of the member’s surchargeable contributions for that year.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  the member has not quoted his or her tax file number to the Commissioner in connection with the operation or the possible future operation of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner has not, after taking all reasonable steps, found out the member’s tax file number; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner has written a letter to the member at the member’s last‑known address telling the member that, if the member does not quote his or her tax file number, the rate of surcharge that will apply to the member for a financial year (the **_relevant financial year_**) may be the maximum surcharge percentage of the member’s surchargeable contributions for that year;

the following provisions have effect:

                     (d)  if contributed amounts in respect of contributions began to be paid for or by the member to a superannuation provider before 7 May 1997 and the member’s surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year exceed the surchargeable contributions threshold—the rate of surcharge that applies in respect of the member’s surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year is the maximum surcharge percentage of those contributions;

                     (e)  if contributed amounts in respect of contributions began to be paid for or by the member to a superannuation provider before 7 May 1997 and the member’s surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year do not exceed the surchargeable contributions threshold—the rate of surcharge that applies in respect of the member’s surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year is nil;

                      (f)  subject to subsection (5), if no contributed amounts in respect of contributions began to be paid for or by the member to a superannuation provider before 7 May 1997—the rate of surcharge that applies in respect of the member’s surchargeable contributions for the relevant financial year is the maximum surcharge percentage of those contributions.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the Commissioner has written a letter to a member as mentioned in paragraph (4)(c); and

                     (b)  the member has not quoted his or her tax file number as mentioned in paragraph (4)(a) within 3 months after the letter was sent;

paragraph (4)(f) does not apply in respect of the member unless the Commissioner has, after that period, written a further letter to the member:

                     (c)  to an address determined by the Commissioner as most appropriate for the letter to reach the member; and

                     (d)  in the same terms as the earlier letter.
