**Newstart allowance rate calculator for administrative breach rate reduction period**

This is how to work out a person’s rate of newstart allowance for an administrative breach rate reduction period that applies to the person.

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the person’s maximum basic rate of newstart allowance specified in:

               (a)     Table B of Module B of Part 3.5 (Benefit Rate Calculator A); or

               (b)     Table B of Module B of Part 3.6 (Benefit Rate Calculator B);

              the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

_Step 2._   Work out the **_rate reduction amount_** in accordance with subsection (2).

_Step 3._   Take the rate reduction amount away from the rate of benefit worked out in accordance with Benefit Rate Calculator A in section 1067 or Benefit Rate Calculator B in section 1068, as the case requires:

              the result is called the **_administrative breach reduced rate_**.

                   Note:             An administrative breach reduced rate may be a nil rate.</div>

                   For the avoidance of doubt, sections 136C and 136D do not prevent a youth training allowance ceasing to be payable in circumstances that do not involve the application of an administrative breach rate reduction period.

##### <a id="136F"></a>136F  Administrative breach rate reduction period not to apply in certain circumstances

                   Despite any other provision of this Part, an administrative breach rate reduction period does not apply if:

                     (a)  a person receives a youth training allowance; and

                     (b)  youth training allowance ceases to be payable to the person because of section 114 or 115; and

                     (c)  payment of the youth training allowance is cancelled or automatically terminated; and

                     (d)  the person lodges a claim for a youth training allowance more than 14 days after the date of effect of the cancellation or automatic termination referred to in paragraph (c).

##### <a id="136G"></a>136G  Rate of youth training allowance where administrative breach rate reduction applies

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an administrative breach rate reduction period applies to a person under this Part; and

                     (b)  the person qualifies for a youth training allowance; and

                     (c)  a youth training allowance is payable to the person;

the person’s rate of youth training allowance for the administrative breach rate reduction period is worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

**Youth training allowance rate calculator for administrative breach rate reduction period**

This is how to work out a person’s rate of youth training allowance for an administrative breach rate reduction period that applies to the person.

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out the person’s maximum basic rate of youth training allowance specified in Table B of Module B of Schedule 1;

              the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

_Step 2._   Work out the **_rate reduction amount_** in accordance with subsection (2).

_Step 3._   Take the rate reduction amount away from the rate of youth training allowance worked out in accordance with Schedule 1;

              the result is called the **_administrative breach reduced rate_**.

                   Note:             An administrative breach reduced rate may be a nil rate.</div>

             (2)  A person’s rate reduction amount is worked out as follows:

Note 1:       For **_compensation affected payment_**, see subsection 17(1) of the Social Security Act.

                     (b)  youth training allowance that would (apart from subsection (6) of this section) be payable to the partner during that period.

Example:

Facts:         Veronique has, at all times in the past 4 months, been receiving widow allowance. Her fortnightly payment rate is $200\. She applies for an advance payment of $300.

Result:       The maximum amount of advance payment payable to Veronique is worked out under subsection (3) as follows:
