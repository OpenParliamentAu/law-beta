                   Levy payable in accordance with subsection 8(6) of the _Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998_ is imposed.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Amount of levy

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the amount of levy payable by a trustee of a superannuation entity for a financial year is the sum of the restricted levy component and the unrestricted levy component for the financial year.

Note:          For **_restricted levy component_**, see subsection (1A). For **_unrestricted levy component_**, see subsection (1B).

          (1A)  The **_restricted levy_** **_component_** for the financial year is:

                     (a)  unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies—the amount that, for the financial year, is the restricted levy percentage of:

                              (i)  except where the superannuation entity was an unregulated entity on 30 June of the previous financial year—the superannuation entity’s levy base on that day; or

                             (ii)  if the superannuation entity was an unregulated entity, or was not in existence, on 30 June of the previous financial year—the entity’s levy base on the day when the entity became a superannuation entity; or

                     (b)  if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) exceeds the maximum restricted levy amount for the financial year—the maximum restricted levy amount; or

                     (c)  if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) is less than the minimum restricted levy amount for the financial year—the minimum restricted levy amount.

Note:          The restricted levy percentage, maximum restricted levy amount, minimum restricted levy amount and the method of working out the superannuation entity’s levy base are as determined under subsection (3).

          (1B)  The **_unrestricted levy_** **_component_** for the financial year is the amount that, for the financial year, is the unrestricted levy percentage of:

                     (a)  if the superannuation entity was an unregulated entity, or was not in existence, on 30 June of the previous financial year—the entity’s levy base on the day when the entity became a superannuation entity; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the superannuation entity’s levy base on 30 June of the previous financial year.

Note:          The unrestricted levy percentage is as determined under subsection (3).

             (2)  If the levy imposition day for the trustee of a superannuation entity for the financial year is later than 1 July in the financial year, the amount of levy payable by the trustee for the financial year is the amount worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00454/Html/SuperSuperLevyImpos98WD02_image002.gif)

             (3)  The Treasurer is, by legislative instrument, to determine:

                     (a)  the **_maximum restricted levy_** **_amount_** for each financial year; and

                     (b)  the **_minimum restricted levy amount_** for each financial year; and

                     (c)  the **_restricted levy percentage_** for each financial year; and

                    (ca)  the **_unrestricted levy percentage_** for each financial year; and

                     (d)  how a **_superannuation entity’s levy base_** is to be worked out.

             (4)  An amount determined under subsection (3) as the maximum restricted levy amount must not exceed the statutory upper limit as at the time when the determination is made.

          (4A)  A determination under subsection (3) may make different provision for different classes of superannuation entity.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Calculation of indexation factor

             (1)  The indexation factor for a financial year is the number worked out by:

                     (a)  dividing the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that financial year by the index number for the March quarter immediately preceding that first-mentioned March quarter; and

                     (b)  adding 0.030 to the number worked out under paragraph (a).

             (2)  The indexation factor is to be calculated to 3 decimal places, but increased by .001 if the 4th decimal place is more than 4.

             (3)  Calculations under paragraph (1)(a):

                     (a)  are to be made using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and

                     (b)  are to be made disregarding index numbers that are published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations for the purposes of subsection 2(2).
