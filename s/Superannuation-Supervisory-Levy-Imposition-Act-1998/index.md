	(b)	in any other case—the day, during the financial year, on which the superannuation entity becomes a superannuation entity.
statutory upper limit means:
	(a)	in relation to the first financial year that ends after this Act commences—$500,000; or
	(b)	in relation to a later financial year—the amount calculated by multiplying the statutory upper limit for the previous financial year by the indexation factor for the later financial year.
superannuation entity means an entity that:

	(b)	is not an excluded superannuation fund within the meaning of that Act.

6  Imposition of superannuation industry supervisory levy
		Levy payable in accordance with subsection 8(6) of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998 is imposed.
7  Amount of levy
	(1)	Subject to subsection (2), the amount of levy payable by a trustee of a superannuation entity for a financial year is:
	(a)	unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies—the amount that, for the financial year, is the levy percentage of the superannuation entity’s asset value on 30 June of the previous financial year; or
	(b)	if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) exceeds the maximum levy amount for the financial year—the maximum levy amount; or
	(c)	if the amount worked out under paragraph (a) is less than the minimum levy amount for the financial year—the minimum levy amount.
Note:	The levy percentage, maximum levy amount, minimum levy amount and the method of working out the superannuation entity’s asset value, are as determined under subsection (3).
	(2)	If the levy imposition day for the trustee of a superannuation entity for the financial year is later than 1 July in the financial year, the amount of levy payable by the trustee for the financial year is the amount worked out using the following formula:

	(3)	Calculations under subsection (1):
	(a)	are to be made using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published reference base for the Consumer Price Index; and
	(b)	are to be made disregarding index numbers that are published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the reference base).
