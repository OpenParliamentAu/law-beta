             (1)  This Part enables the Commission to grant licences to Commonwealth authorities or eligible corporations.

             (2)  If a licence is granted to a Commonwealth authority, this Act continues to apply in relation to employees of the authority but, depending on the scope of the licence, the application of this Act is subject to either or both of the following:

                     (a)  the acceptance by the authority of the whole or a part of the liability under this Act for payments in respect of injury, loss or damage suffered by, or the death of, some or all of its employees;

                     (b)  the acceptance by the authority of the responsibility for managing certain claims under this Act in respect of injury, loss or damage suffered by, or the death of, some or all of its employees.

             (3)  If a licence is granted to an eligible corporation, this Act applies in relation to some or all of the employees of the corporation in a similar way to the way in which it applies to employees of the Commonwealth but the application is subject to:

                     (a)  the acceptance by the corporation of the whole or a part of the liability under this Act for payments in respect of injury, loss or damage suffered by, or the death of, those employees; and

                     (b)  the acceptance by the corporation of the function of managing claims under this Act in respect of that injury, loss, damage or death.

             (4)  If a licence is granted to a Commonwealth authority or to a corporation, the application of this Act is also subject to the conditions to which the licence is subject.

### Division 2—Powers of the Commission in relation to licences

##### <a id="102"></a>102  Application for grant of a licence

             (1)  An application by an eligible applicant for the grant of a licence must:

                     (a)  be in writing in the prescribed form; and

                     (b)  contain such particulars of the eligible applicant as the regulations prescribe; and

                     (c)  having regard to the scope of the licence sought—contain such other information, and be accompanied by such documents, as the regulations provide; and

             (2)  The eligible applicant is liable to pay to Comcare in respect of the application an application fee equal to the amount estimated by the Commission to be the cost of considering the application.

             (3)  The Commission is to give written notice to the eligible applicant of the amount of the application fee and:

                     (a)  if the notice is given before the application is made—the application fee is to accompany the application; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the application fee is to be paid as soon as practicable after the notice is given.

             (4)  An eligible applicant may withdraw an application at any time before a decision is made on the application.

             (5)  If the application is withdrawn after receipt by Comcare of the application fee, the Commission may, depending upon the extent to which it has already considered the application:

                     (a)  request Comcare to refund the application fee entirely; or

                     (b)  reduce the application fee by such amount as it considers reasonable having regard to the extent of that consideration and request Comcare to refund the amount of the reduction.

             (6)  For the purpose of subsection (5), the reference to the extent of the Commission’s consideration of an application includes a reference to any act or thing done by Comcare to assist the Commission in that consideration.

##### <a id="103"></a>103  The Commission’s power to grant licences

             (1)  The Commission may, on application made in accordance with section 102, grant the eligible applicant a licence for a specified period.

             (2)  If the Commission grants a licence to an eligible applicant, the Commission must determine:

                     (a)  in accordance with Division 3—the scope of the licence so far as concerns the degree to which, and the circumstances in which, the licensee may accept liability for compensation; and

                     (b)  in accordance with Division 4—the scope of the licence so far as concerns the degree to which, and the circumstances in which, the licensee is authorised to manage claims; and

                     (c)  in accordance with Division 5—the conditions (if any) to which the grant of the licence is subject.

##### <a id="104"></a>104  Licence decision

             (1)  If the Commission considers, having regard to:

                     (a)  the information contained in an application received by it; and

                     (b)  any further information that is provided to the Commission by the applicant for the purpose of enabling consideration of the application; and

                     (c)  any other matter that the Commission considers relevant;

that it is appropriate to do so, the Commission may grant the licence sought. On granting the licence, the Commission must, by written notice given to the applicant, inform the applicant of its decision.

             (2)  In order for the Commission to be satisfied, for the purposes of subsection (1), that it is appropriate to grant an applicant the licence sought, the Commission must be satisfied that:

                     (a)  the applicant has sufficient resources to fulfil the responsibilities imposed on it under the licence; and

                     (b)  the applicant has the capacity to ensure (where the scope of the licence so provides) that claims that are to be managed either by the licensee, or by another person identified in the licence on the licensee’s behalf, will be managed in accordance with standards set by the Commission for the management of claims; and

                     (c)  the grant of the licence will not be contrary to the interests of the employees of the licensee whose affairs fall within the scope of the licence; and

                     (d)  the applicant has the capacity to meet the standards set by the Commission for the rehabilitation and occupational health and safety of its employees.

             (3)  If the Commission does not consider it appropriate to grant the applicant the licence sought, it must, by written notice given to the applicant, inform the applicant that it has decided to refuse the application and provide reasons for its decision.

             (4)  Nothing in subsection (3) prevents the Commission, with the written agreement of the applicant, granting the applicant a licence having a different scope to the licence sought by the applicant.

##### <a id="104A"></a>104A  Licence fees

             (1)  At the date of commencement of a licence, and at each 1 July after that date, while the licence is in force, the licensee becomes liable to pay a licence fee in respect of the holding or continued holding of the licence.

             (2)  The amount of the licence fee is the amount notified in writing to the licensee by the Commission, being the amount estimated by the Commission to represent:

                     (a)  that part of the cost incurred by the Commission and by Comcare in carrying out their respective functions under this Act (other than the function referred to in paragraph 69(ec)) during the relevant period that is reasonably referrable to the licensee; and

                     (b)  so far as concerns a licensee who is covered by the _Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991_—that part of the cost incurred by the Commission and by Comcare in carrying out their respective functions under that Act  during the relevant period that is reasonably referrable to the licensee.

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the relevant period is:

                     (a)  in the case of the first licence fee payable in respect of the licence—the period starting on the date of commencement of the licence and ending on the next 30 June; or

                     (b)  in the case of a subsequent licence fee payable in respect of a financial year while the licence remains in force—that financial year.

             (4)  The fee is payable to Comcare within such period after it is notified to the licensee as the Commission determines.

##### <a id="105"></a>105  The Commission may vary the scope of a licence or extend its term

             (1)  The Commission may, at any time while a licence is in force, on the written application of the licensee, vary the scope of the licence or extend its term.

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) implies that an applicant whose licence, or licence as extended, has expired, or is to expire, may not apply for a new licence under this Part.

##### <a id="106"></a>106  Suspension or revocation of licences at the instance of the Commission

             (1)  If the Commission considers it appropriate to do so, the Commission may, by written notice given to the licensee:

                     (a)  suspend the licence for a specified period; or

                     (b)  revoke the licence.

             (2)  Before taking action under subsection (1), the Commission must follow such procedures, if any, as are specified in the Minister’s directions as procedures preliminary to the suspension or revocation of a licence at the instance of the Commission.

##### <a id="107"></a>107  Revocation of licence at request of licensee

                   The Commission may, at the written request of a licensee, by written notice to the licensee, revoke the licence held by the licensee.

##### <a id="107A"></a>107A  Effect of suspension or revocation

                   The regulations may provide for the consequences of:

                     (a)  the suspension of a licence under section 106; or

                     (b)  the revocation of a licence under section 106 or 107.

### Division 3—Authorisation to accept liability in respect of certain claims

##### <a id="108"></a>108  Licence can authorise licensee to accept liability

             (1)  A licence may provide that the licensee is authorised to accept liability to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of particular injury, loss or damage suffered by, or in respect of the death of, some or all of its employees under this Act.

             (2)  The scope of the licence, so far as it authorises acceptance of liability to pay such compensation and other amounts, may be determined by the Commission.

             (3)  The Commission may determine, as part of the scope of the licence, that the licensee may accept such liability in respect of such injury, loss, damage or death occurring at a time before the licence came into force.

##### <a id="108A"></a>108A  The consequences of a licensee’s authorisation to accept liability

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a licensee is authorised to accept liability to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of particular injury, loss or damage suffered by, or in respect of the death of, some or all of its employees; and

                     (b)  such injury, loss, damage or death occurs;

then:

                     (c)  the licensee is liable to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of that injury, loss, damage or death; and

                     (d)  Comcare is not liable to pay compensation or other amounts under this Act in respect of that injury, loss, damage or death.

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) affects Comcare’s liability to pay compensation or other amounts under this Act in respect of a particular injury, loss, damage or death for which Comcare would have been liable, but for the operation of the licence, to the extent that the liability is not a liability that the licensee is authorised to accept.

             (3)  The fact that a licensee is authorised to accept liability to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of a particular injury, loss, damage or death does not render the licensee liable to have any proceedings (including proceedings under Part VI) brought against it in respect of that particular injury, loss, damage or death other than proceedings for the recovery of that compensation and those other amounts.

Note:          If licensees are authorised to manage claims, proceedings may be brought against them in respect of the management of those claims (see subsection 108C(7)).

             (4)  If proceedings have been brought against Comcare in respect of a particular injury, loss, damage or death for which a licensee is liable to pay compensation or other amounts under this Act, Comcare must inform the licensee, in writing, as soon as practicable, that the proceedings have been brought.

             (5)  On being informed that proceedings have been brought against Comcare in respect of a particular injury, loss, damage or death, the court or tribunal before which the proceedings have been brought must, on application of the licensee, join the licensee as a party to the proceedings.

             (6)  A decision in any proceedings referred to in subsection (4) is binding on Comcare and on the licensee concerned, whether or not the licensee has made application to become a party to the proceedings.

             (7)  If a licensee who is a corporation is authorised to accept liability to pay compensation and other amounts under this Act in respect of a particular injury, loss or damage suffered by, or in respect of the death of, some or all of its employees after the licence comes into force then:

                     (a)  no law of a State or Territory relating to workers compensation applies to a licensee in respect of such injury, loss, damage or death; and

                     (b)  any liability or obligation of the corporation under a law of a State or Territory in respect of such injury, loss or damage suffered, or death occurring, before the licence came into force is unaffected.

### Division 4—Authorisation to manage claims

##### <a id="108B"></a>108B  Licence can authorise licensee to manage claims

             (1)  A licence may authorise the licensee, or a specified person acting on the licensee’s behalf, to manage some or all of the claims made by employees of the licensee under this Act.

             (2)  The scope of the licence, so far as it authorises management by the licensee of claims made under this Act, may be determined by the Commission.

             (3)  A licensee may at any time enter into a contract with another person for the management, on the licensee’s behalf, of the claims that the licensee is authorised to manage.

             (4)  If the licensee enters into such a contract it does not come into force unless and until the Commission has varied the licence to note the identity of the person with whom the licensee has contracted for the management of claims.

             (5)  Nothing in this section implies that the scope of the licence, so far as it authorises management of claims by the licensee, may not extend to the management of claims that were made at a time before the licence came into force, whether or not the management of those claims has been commenced before the licence came into force.

             (6)  The scope of the licence, so far as it authorises management of claims made by employees of an eligible corporation, must relate to the same employees of the corporation as those covered by the scope of the licence so far as it relates to acceptance of liability.

##### <a id="108C"></a>108C  The consequences of a licensee’s authorisation to manage claims

             (1)  If a licensee is authorised to manage claims, the licensee must determine any particular claim that the licensee is authorised to manage in accordance with the scope of its licence.

             (2)  If a licensee is authorised to manage claims made before the licence comes into force, then, in respect of any particular claim that the licensee is authorised to manage:

                     (a)  a determination made by Comcare that is in force immediately before the licence comes into force is taken, after that time, to have been a determination made by the licensee in relation to that claim; and

                     (b)  any other thing done by Comcare that is in force immediately before the licence comes into force is taken, after that time, to have been done by the licensee in relation to that claim.

             (3)  If a licensee is authorised to manage claims, then, in respect of any particular claim that the licensee is authorised to manage:

## 76  Saving provision—Continuance of Division 4A in respect of certain premiums

Despite the repeal of Division 4A of Part VII of the _Safety,_ _Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988_ effected by item 75 of this Schedule, the provisions of that Division as in force before 1 July 2002 continue in force on and after that date in relation to premiums payable by each Entity and Commonwealth authority:

                     (b)  each subsequent financial year starting before 1 July 2002;

as if those provisions had not been repealed.

## 77  Saving provision—Review by Commission unaffected by repeal of Division 4A

Without limiting the generality of item 76 of this Schedule, the Commission may:

                     (a)  if, before 1 July 2002, it had commenced but not completed a review, under section 96D of the _Safety,_ _Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988_, of the estimate of a premium determined to be payable by an Entity or Commonwealth authority in respect of a financial year starting before 1 July 2002—complete that review; or

                     (b)  if, before that date, it had not commenced under that section a review of such an estimate—undertake that review;

as if the repeal of Division 4A of Part VII of that Act had not occurred.

## 78  Saving provision—Review by Minister unaffected by repeal of Division 4A

(1)        Without limiting the generality of item 76 of this Schedule, if, before 1 July 2002, the Minister had commenced but not completed a review under section 96F of the _Safety,_ _Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988_ of:

                     (a)  an estimate of a premium determined to be payable by an Entity or Commonwealth authority in respect of a financial year starting before 1 July 2002; or

                     (b)  that estimate as varied by the Commission as a result of a review under section 96D of that Act;

the Minister may complete that review as if the repeal of Division 4A of Part VII of that Act had not occurred.

(2)        Without limiting the generality of item 76 of this Schedule, if, before 1 July 2002, the Minister had not commenced a review under section 96F of the _Safety,_ _Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988_ of:

                     (a)  an estimate of a premium determined to be payable by an Entity or Commonwealth authority in respect of a financial year starting before 1 July 2002; or

                     (b)  that estimate as varied by the Commission as a result of a review under section 96D of that Act;

the Minister may undertake that review as if the repeal of Division 4A of Part VII of that Act had not occurred.

## 79  Saving provision—Notices, requests and directions continue to have effect

Any notice, request or direction given or made under, or for the purposes of, a provision of Division 4A of Part VII of the _Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988_ as in force before 1 July 2002 continues to have effect, on and after that date, as a notice, request or direction given or made under, or for the purposes of, that provision as continued in force in accordance with item 76 of this Schedule.

## 80  Validation of certain acts or things done in relation to actions for non-economic loss

(1)        If a contribution or premium was collected under the _Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988_ from an Entity or a Commonwealth authority in respect of a financial year starting before 1 July 1999 or in respect of a part of such a year, then, despite any indication to the contrary in the provisions of that Act as in force at the time the contribution or premium was determined or otherwise ascertained, that contribution or premium is taken to have been determined on the basis that it covered:

                     (a)  liability for compensation payable under that Act; and
