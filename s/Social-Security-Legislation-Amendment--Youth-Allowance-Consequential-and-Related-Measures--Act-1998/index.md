the time already spent by the student on the course, or on one or more other tertiary courses at the same level as that course, does not exceed the allowable study time for that course.

Note:          For allowable study time for a course see subsection (3).

Concessional study-load students

             (2)  A person who is a concessional study-load student in respect of a tertiary course satisfies the progress rules if:

                     (a)  in the case of a person who is enrolled in the course—on the day on which the person enrolled in the course; or 

                     (b)  in the case of a person who is not yet enrolled in the course but intends to enrol in the course—on the day on which enrolments in the course are next accepted;

the time already spent by the person on the course, or on one or more other tertiary courses at the same level as that course, does not exceed the allowable study time for the course.

Note:          For allowable study time for a course see subsections (3) and (4).

Allowable study time—full-time students and 66% concessional study-load students

             (3)  The allowable study time for a course undertaken by a full-time student or a 66% concessional study-load student is:

                     (a)  if the minimum amount of time needed to complete the course as a full-time student is one year or less—that minimum amount of time; or

                     (b)  if the minimum amount of time needed to complete the course as a full-time student is more than 1 year and:

                              (i)  the student is enrolled, or intends to enrol, in a year-long subject; or

                             (ii)  the student’s further progress in the course depends on passing a whole year’s work in the course;

                            the minimum amount of time plus 1 year; or

                     (c)  in any other case—the minimum amount of time needed to complete the course as a full-time student plus half an academic year.

Allowable study time—25% concessional study-load students

             (4)  The allowable study time for a course undertaken by a 25% concessional study-load student is twice the minimum period in which it is possible to complete the course as a full-time student but the Secretary may approve, in particular cases, an allowable study time of up to four times the minimum period in which it is possible to complete the course as a full-time student.

Time spent by person studying part-time

             (5)  If a student has studied part-time for a course over a certain period, the time spent by the student on that course is taken to be the proportion of that period calculated by using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00285/Html/D11BAE1FDCCEA431CA257705001FA710/$FILE/SocialSecLegAmendYouthAllowConseqRelatMeasures1998_image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="normal-full-time-studi"></a>**_normal full-time study_** means the normal amount of full-time study for the course.

                    <a name="studi-undertaken"></a>**_study undertaken_** means the amount of study undertaken part-time by the student for the course.

Current full-time students who have previously undertaken courses as concessional study-load students

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  a person is undertaking a course as a full-time student; and

                     (b)  the person has previously undertaken:

                              (i)  part of the course; or

                             (ii)  one or more than one other course at the same level as that course;

                            as a concessional study-load student; and

                     (c)  the time spent by the person undertaking the part of the course referred to in subparagraph (b)(i), or the course or courses referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii), (the **_previous study_**) is not to be disregarded under subsection (7);

the time spent by the person undertaking the previous study is taken to be equal to the minimum amount of time that a full-time student would have taken to complete the previous study. 

Matters to be disregarded in determining whether someone has exceeded the allowable study time

             (7)  In determining whether a person has exceeded the allowable study time (for a full-time student or a concessional study-load student), disregard the following:

                     (a)  if the person has completed a course (a pre-requisite course) the completion of which is the normal requirement for admission to the course in which the person is enrolled or intends to enrol—time spent undertaking the pre-requisite course;

                     (b)  a failed year of study, or a failed part of a year of study, if the failure is because of:

                              (i)  the person’s illness; or

                             (ii)  other circumstances beyond the person’s control;

                     (c)  time spent undertaking a course that has been permanently discontinued because of:

                              (i)  the person’s illness; or

                             (ii)  other circumstances beyond the person’s control; 

                     (d)  time spent undertaking a course that has been completed but which, because of the person’s illness, the person cannot use in any of the trades or profession to which the course is appropriate;

                     (e)  time spent undertaking a TAFE course if the normal length of the course for a full-time student is one year or less;

                      (f)  time spent undertaking a course more than 10 years ago, unless the course has since been completed;

                     (g)  time spent undertaking a course after 1973 if the course was not:

                              (i)  approved for the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; or

                             (ii)  approved for the AUSTUDY scheme; or

                            (iii)  an approved course for the purposes of paragraph 541B(1)(c), 569A(b) or 1061PB(1)(b) of this Act;

                     (h)  time spent undertaking a course at a foreign institution; 

                      (i)  time spent undertaking a subject from which the student withdrew, if the educational institution in which the subject was undertaken did not record the withdrawal from the subject as a failure; 

                      (j)  any time spent undertaking a course during which the person was ineligible to receive:

                              (i)  AUSTUDY; or

                             (ii)  a benefit under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; or

                            (iii)  youth allowance; or

                            (iv)  austudy payment;

                            because of the application of rules in respect of academic progress.

##### <a id="576"></a>576  Third and subsequent activity test breaches lead to activity test non-payment period

                   An activity test non-payment period applies to a person if:

                     (b)  the latest breach is the third or subsequent activity test breach in the 2 years immediately before the day after the latest breach.

Note:          If the latest breach is the first or second activity test breach in the 2 years before the latest breach, an activity test rate reduction period applies to the person (see Subdivision B of Division 5).

##### <a id="576A"></a>576A  Activity test breaches

                   A person has committed an activity test breach if:

##### <a id="576C"></a>576C  Start of activity test non-payment period

Notice of start of period

             (1)  If an activity test non-payment period applies to a person under this Part, the Secretary must give the person a written notice telling the person of the start of the period.

General rule

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3) of this section and section 576E, the activity test non-payment period starts on the day on which the notice is given to the person.

                     (a)  on or before the day on which a person’s activity test non-payment period would (apart from this subsection) have started, an austudy payment ceases to be payable to the person; and

                     (b)  it has not ceased to be payable because of the application of an activity test non-payment period;

the activity test non-payment period starts on the day on which the austudy payment ceases to be payable to the person.

##### <a id="576D"></a>576D  Interaction with activity test breach rate reduction periods

Application of section

             (1)  This section applies if, under this Part:

                     (a)  an activity test non-payment period applies to a person; and

                     (b)  during the whole or a part of that period, the whole or a part of an activity test breach rate reduction period (**_overlap period_**) applies to the person.

Note:          An administrative breach rate reduction period may also apply to the person (see section 583C).

Overlap period

             (2)  Subject to subsection (4), the activity test non-payment period and the activity test breach rate reduction period are to run concurrently during the overlap period.

Which restriction is to apply

             (3)  Subject to section 576E, only the non-payment restriction relating to the activity test non-payment period is to apply to the person during the overlap period.

Pre-existing activity test breach rate reduction period

             (4)  If, at the time of the commencement of an activity test non-payment period under this Part, the person is already subject to an activity test breach rate reduction period (**_pre-existing reduction period_**), the pre-existing reduction period is taken to end immediately before the commencement of the activity test non-payment period under this Part.

##### <a id="576E"></a>576E  Interaction with waiting periods

Application of section

             (1)  This section applies if, under this Part:

                     (a)  an activity test non-payment period applies to a person; and

                     (b)  during the whole or a part of that period, the whole or a part of a waiting period (**_overlap period_**) applies to the person.

Note:          An administrative breach rate reduction period may also apply to the person (see section 583C).

Overlap period

             (2)  The non-payment period and the waiting period are to run concurrently during the overlap period.

Which restriction is to apply

             (3)  Despite any other provision of this Act, only the restriction on payment relating to the waiting period is to apply to the person during the overlap period.

##### <a id="576F"></a>576F  Effect of sections 576C, 576D and 576E

                   For the avoidance of doubt, sections 576C, 576D and 576E do not prevent an austudy payment ceasing to be payable in circumstances that do not involve the application of an activity test non-payment period under this Part.

##### <a id="576G"></a>576G  Where one event may give rise to both an activity test penalty and an administrative breach rate reduction period

                   If, but for this section, an event would result in both an activity test penalty period and an administrative breach rate reduction period applying to a person under the provisions of this Act, only the provision imposing the activity test penalty period is to apply to the person.

### Austudy Payment Rate Calculator

#### Module A—Overall rate calculation process

Method of calculating rate

  1067L-A1  The rate of payment is a fortnightly rate.

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1_. Work out the person’s maximum basic rate using Module B below.

_Step 2_. Work out the amount a fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using Module C below.

_Step 3_. Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 1 to 2: the result is the **_maximum payment rate_**.

_Step 4_. Apply the income test using Module D below to work out the person’s income reduction.

_Step 5_. Take away the person’s income reduction from the maximum payment rate: the result is the **_provisional payment rate_**.

                   Note:             If a person’s rate is reduced under this step, the order in which the reduction is to be made is laid down by section 1207 (maximum basic rate first, then pharmaceutical allowance).

_Step 6_.   The rate of payment is the difference between:

               (a)     the provisional payment rate; and

               (b)     any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A);

              plus any applicable amount of remote area allowance (see Module F below).</div>

#### Module B—Maximum basic rate

Maximum basic rate

  1067L-B1  A person’s maximum basic rate is to be worked out as follows:

                     (a)  if the person is not a long term income support student (see section 1067K)—use Table BA;

#### Module C—Pharmaceutical allowance

Qualification for pharmaceutical allowance

  1067L-C1  Subject to point 1067L-C2, an amount by way of pharmaceutical allowance is to be added to a person’s maximum basic rate if:

                     (a)  the person is in Australia; and

                     (b)  the person has turned 60; and

                     (c)  the person has been receiving income support payments in respect of a continuous period of at least 9 months (whether or not the kind of payment received has changed over the period and whether the period or any part of it occurred before or after the commencement of this paragraph).

Note 1:       For **_income support payment_** see subsection 23(1).

Note 2:       For the determination of the continuous period in respect of which a person received income support payments see section 38B.

No pharmaceutical allowance if partner receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and not a service pensioner

  1067L-C2  Pharmaceutical allowance is not to be added to a person’s maximum basic rate if:

                     (a)  the person is a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  the person’s partner is receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act; and

                     (c)  the person’s partner is not receiving a service pension.

Note:          If paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) apply to the person’s partner, the partner is receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act at the higher rate (rather than the person and the person’s partner each receiving pharmaceutical allowance at the lower rate).

#### Module D—Income test

Effect of ordinary income on maximum payment rate

  1067L-D1  This is how to work out the effect of:

                     (a)  a person’s ordinary income; and

                     (b)  the ordinary income of a partner of the person;

on the person’s maximum payment rate:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1_. Work out the amount of the person’s ordinary income on a fortnightly basis (where appropriate, taking into account the matters provided for in points 1067L-D2 to 1067L-D24).

                   Note:             The person’s ordinary income may be reduced under Module E below (student income bank).

_Step 2_. If the person is a member of a couple, work out the partner income free area using point 1067L-D25.

                   Note:             The partner income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary income the person’s partner can have without affecting the person’s benefit.

_Step 3_. Use point 1067L-D26 to work out the person’s partner income excess. (If there is no partner income excess under that point, the person’s partner income excess is taken to be nil.)

_Step 4_. Use the person’s partner income excess to work out the person’s partner income reduction using point 1067L-D27.

_Step 5_.   Use point 1067L-D29 to work out the person’s ordinary income excess. (If there is no ordinary income excess under that point, the person’s ordinary income excess is taken to be nil.)

_Step 6_. Use the person’s ordinary income excess to work out the person’s ordinary income reduction using points 1067L-D30, 1067L-D31 and 1067L-D32.

_Step 7_. Add the person’s partner income reduction and ordinary income reduction: the result is the **_person’s income reduction_** referred to in Step 4 of the Method statement in point 1067L-A1.</div>

Note 1:       For **_ordinary income_** see subsection 8(1).

Note 2:       The application of the income test is affected by provisions concerning the following:

(a)           the general concept of ordinary income (sections 1072 and 1073);

(b)           business income (sections 1074 and 1075);

(c)           deemed income from financial assets (sections 1076 to 1084A);

(d)           income from income streams (sections 1096 to 1099D);

(e)           disposal of income (sections 1106 to 1112).

Ordinary income of members of certain couples

  1067L-D2  If a person is a member of a couple and the person’s partner is receiving a social security pension, a service pension or a rehabilitation allowance, the person’s ordinary income is taken to be one half of the sum of:

                     (a)  the amount that would be the person’s ordinary income if he or she were not a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  the amount that would be the ordinary income of the person’s partner if the partner were not a member of a couple.

Termination payments

  1067L-D3  Subject to points 1067L-D4 to 1067L-D16 (inclusive), if:

                     (a)  a person’s employment has been terminated; and

                     (b)  as a result the person is entitled to a lump sum payment from the person’s former employer;

the person is taken to have received the lump sum payment on the day on which the person’s employment was terminated.

Rolling over lump sum leave payments

  1067L-D4  If:

                     (a)  a person’s employment has been terminated; and

                     (b)  as a result the person is entitled to a lump sum leave payment from the person’s former employer; and

                     (c)  the person rolls over the lump sum leave payment into an approved deposit fund, a superannuation fund or a deferred annuity;

the lump sum leave payment is to be disregarded in working out the ordinary income of the person for the purposes of this Module.

Certain leave payments taken to be ordinary income—employment continuing

  1067L-D5  If:

                     (a)  a person is employed; and

                     (b)  the person is on leave for a period; and

                     (c)  the person is or was entitled to receive a leave payment (whether as a lump sum payment, as a payment that is one of a series of regular payments or otherwise) in respect of a part or all of a leave period;

the person is taken to have received ordinary income for a period (the **_income maintenance period_**) equal to the leave period to which the leave payment entitlement relates.

Certain leave payments taken to be ordinary income—employment terminated

  1067L-D6  If:

                     (a)  a person’s employment has been terminated; and

                     (b)  the person receives a leave payment (whether as a lump sum payment, as a payment that is one of a series of regular payments or otherwise);

the person is taken to have received ordinary income for a period (the **_income maintenance period_**) equal to the leave period to which the payment relates.

More than one leave payment on a day

  1067L-D7  If:

                     (a)  the person is covered by point 1067L-D6; and

                     (b)  the person receives more than one leave payment on a day;

the income maintenance period is worked out by adding the leave periods to which the payments relate.

Start of income maintenance period—employment continuing

  1067L-D8  If the person is covered by point 1067L-D5, the income maintenance period starts on the first day of the leave period to which the leave payment entitlement relates.

Start of income maintenance period—employment terminated

  1067L-D9  If the person is covered by point 1067L-D6, the income maintenance period starts, subject to point 1067L-D10, on the day on which the person is paid the leave payment.

Commencement of income maintenance period where there is a second leave payment—employment terminated

1067L-D10  If:

                     (a)  a person who is covered by point 1067L-D6 is subject to an income maintenance period (the **_first period_**); and

                     (b)  the person is paid another leave payment during that period (the **_second leave payment_**);

the income maintenance period for the second leave payment starts on the day after the end of the first period.

Leave payments in respect of periods longer than a fortnight

 1067L-D11  If:

                     (a)  a person receives a leave payment; and

                     (b)  the payment is in respect of a period of leave longer than a fortnight;

the person is taken to receive in a payment fortnight or part of a payment fortnight an amount calculated by:

                     (c)  dividing the amount received by the number of days in the period of leave to which the payment relates (**_daily rate_**); and

                     (d)  multiplying the daily rate by the number of days in the payment fortnight that are also in the period of leave.

Secretary may determine in certain circumstances that the whole or a part of an income maintenance period does not apply

1067L-D12  The Secretary may determine that the whole or any part of an income maintenance period that would, apart from this point, apply to the person, does not apply to the person if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the application of the income maintenance period to the person would cause the person severe financial hardship; and

                     (b)  the circumstances that would cause the severe financial hardship were not reasonably foreseeable by the person.

When a person receives a leave payment

1067L-D13  For the purposes of points 1067L-D4 to 1067L-D12 (inclusive), a person (**_first person_**) is taken to receive a leave payment if:

                     (a)  the payment is made to another person:

                              (i)  at the direction of the first person or a court; or

                             (ii)  on behalf of the first person; or

                            (iii)  for the benefit of the first person; or

                     (b)  the first person waives or assigns his or her right to receive the payment.

Single payment in respect of different kinds of leave—employment terminated

1067L-D14  If a person who is covered by point 1067L-D6 receives a single payment in respect of different kinds of leave, then, for the purposes of the application of points 1067L-D4 to 1067L-D13 (inclusive):

                     (a)  each part of the payment that is in respect of a different kind of leave is taken to be a separate payment; and

                     (b)  the income maintenance period in respect of the single payment is worked out by adding the leave periods to which the separate payments relate.

Definitions

1067L-D15  In points 1067L-D4 to 1067L-D14 (inclusive):

                    <a name="payment-fortnight"></a>**_payment fortnight_** means a fortnight in respect of which an austudy payment is paid, or would be paid apart from the application of an income maintenance period, to a person.

                    <a name="roll"></a><a name=""></a><a name="roll"></a>**_roll_**-**_over_**, in relation to a lump sum leave payment, has the meaning that **_roll-over_** has in section 27D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to an eligible termination payment.

Meaning of leave payment

1067L-D16  In points 1067L-D4 to 1067L-D15 (inclusive):

                    <a name="leav-payment"></a>**_leave payment_** includes a payment in respect of sick leave, annual leave, maternity leave and long service leave.

Ordinary income includes certain periodical payments from relatives

1067L-D17  Subject to point 1067L-D18 (and despite paragraph 8(8)(z)), a person’s ordinary income for the purposes of this Module includes a periodical payment or benefit by way of gift or allowance from the father, mother, son, daughter, brother or sister of the person.

Board and lodging

1067L-D18  A person’s ordinary income is not to include a payment to the person for board or lodging provided by the person to the person’s father, mother, son, daughter, brother or sister.

Ordinary income generally taken into account when first earned, derived or received

1067L-D19  Subject to points 1067L-D20, 1067L-D21, 1067L-D23 and 1067L-D24 and section 1073, ordinary income is to be taken into account in the fortnight in which it is first earned, derived or received.

Claimant or recipient receives lump sum amount for remunerative work

1067L-D20  If a person whose claim for austudy payment has been granted receives, after the claim was made, a lump sum amount that:

                     (a)  is paid to him or her in relation to remunerative work; and

                     (b)  is not a payment to which point 1067L-D21 applies; and

                     (c)  is not an exempt lump sum;

the person is, for the purposes of this Module, taken to receive one fifty-second of that amount as ordinary income during each week in the 12 months commencing on the day on which the person becomes entitled to receive that amount.

Partner of claimant or recipient receives lump sum amount for remunerative work

1067L-D21  If:

the partner is, for the purposes of this Module, taken to receive one fifty-second of that amount as ordinary income during each week in the 12 months commencing on the day on which the partner becomes entitled to receive that amount.

Operation of points 1067L-D20 and 1067L-D21

1067L-D22  Points 1067L-D20 and 1067L-D21 have effect even if the person who has made the claim is, during the period of 12 months referred to in those points, subject to a liquid assets test waiting period, or an income maintenance period, in respect of the allowance claimed.

Ordinary income received at intervals longer than one fortnight

1067L-D23  Subject to points 1067L-D4 to 1067L-D16 (inclusive), if:

                     (a)  a person receives a number of ordinary income payments; and

                     (b)  each payment is in respect of a period (**_work period_**) that is greater than a fortnight; and

                     (c)  there is reasonable predicability or regularity as to the timing of the payments; and

                     (d)  there is reasonable predicability as to the quantum of the payments;

the person is taken to receive in a fortnight falling within, or overlapping with, a work period an amount calculated by:

                     (e)  dividing the amount received by the number of days in the work period (**_daily rate_**); and

                      (f)  multiplying the daily rate by the number of days in the fortnight that are also within the work period.

Payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments

1067L-D24  If:

                     (a)  at the time of an event that gives rise to an entitlement of a person to compensation, the person is receiving an austudy payment; and

                     (b)  in relation to that entitlement, the person receives a payment of arrears of periodic compensation;

the person is taken to receive, in a fortnight falling within, or overlapping with, the periodic payments period, an amount calculated by:

                     (c)  dividing the amount received by the number of days in the periodic payments period (**_daily rate_**); and

                     (d)  multiplying the daily rate by the number of days in the fortnight that are also within the periodic payments period.

Note:          For **_periodic payments period_** see section 17.

Partner income free area

1067L-D25  The partner income free area for a person is:

                     (a)  if the person’s partner is not receiving a social security benefit and has not turned 21—the amount of income of the partner (rounded up to the nearest dollar) beyond which youth allowance would not be payable to the partner if the partner were qualified for a youth allowance and were not undertaking full-time study (see section 541B); or

                     (b)  if the person’s partner is not receiving a social security benefit and has turned 21—the amount of income of the partner (rounded up to the nearest dollar) beyond which newstart allowance would not be payable to the partner if the partner were qualified for a newstart allowance; or

                     (c)  if the person’s partner is receiving a social security benefit—the amount of income of the partner (rounded up to the nearest dollar) beyond which that benefit would not be payable to the partner.

Partner income excess

1067L-D26  If:

                     (a)  a person is a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  the person’s partner is not receiving a social security pension, service pension or a rehabilitation allowance; and

                     (c)  the partner’s ordinary income exceeds the partner income free area for the partner;

then:

                     (d)  the person has a partner income excess; and

                     (e)  the person’s partner income excess is the amount by which the partner’s ordinary income exceeds the partner income free area.

Partner income reduction

1067L-D27  If a person has a partner income excess, the person’s partner income reduction is an amount equal to 70% of the person’s partner income excess.

Example:    

Facts:         Alice’s partner Martin has an ordinary income of $612\. Assume that the partner income free area under point 1067L-D25 is $462.

Result:       Martin’s ordinary income exceeds the partner income free area. Alice therefore has a partner income excess under point 1067L-D26 of:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00285/Html/D11BAE1FDCCEA431CA257705001FA710/$FILE/SocialSecLegAmendYouthAllowConseqRelatMeasures1998_image010.gif)

                   Alice’s partner income reduction under point 1067L-D27 is therefore:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00285/Html/D11BAE1FDCCEA431CA257705001FA710/$FILE/SocialSecLegAmendYouthAllowConseqRelatMeasures1998_image011.gif)

Ordinary income free area

1067L-D28  A person’s ordinary income free area is $230.

Ordinary income excess

1067L-D29  If a person’s ordinary income exceeds the person’s ordinary income free area:

                     (a)  the person has an ordinary income excess; and

                     (b)  the person’s ordinary income excess is the amount by which the person’s ordinary income exceeds the person’s ordinary income free area.

Ordinary income reduction

1067L-D30  If a person has an ordinary income excess, the person’s ordinary income reduction is the sum of:

                     (a)  the person’s lower range reduction (if any) (see point 1067L-D31); and

                     (b)  the person’s upper range reduction (if any) (see point 1067L-D32).

Lower range reduction

1067L-D31  The person’s lower range reduction is an amount equal to 50% of the part of the person’s ordinary income excess that does not exceed $80.

Upper range reduction

1067L-D32  The person’s upper range reduction is an amount equal to 70% of the part (if any) of the person’s ordinary income excess that exceeds $80.

Example:    

Facts:         Further to the example at the end of point 1067L-D27, Alice has ordinary income of $265.

Result:       Alice’s ordinary income free area under point 1067L-D28 is $230.

                   Her ordinary income exceeds her ordinary income free area. She therefore has an ordinary income excess under point 1067L-D29 of:

                   Because her ordinary income excess does not exceed $80:

(a)           her lower range reduction under point 1067L-D31 is:

(b)           there is no upper range reduction under point 1067L-D32.

                   Her ordinary income reduction under point 1067L-D30 is therefore $17.50.

                   Alice’s income reduction referred to in Step 4 of point 1067L-A1 is:

#### Module E—Student income bank

Student income bank

   1067L-E1  A person’s ordinary income under Module D may be reduced under this Module. This diagram sets out how to work out:

                     (a)  whether the person’s ordinary income for a particular fortnight in respect of which austudy payment may be payable to the person, is to be reduced; and

                     (b)  if it is to be reduced, the amount of the reduction.

Income bank credit

   1067L-E2  A person’s income bank credit for a particular income bank fortnight of the person is to be worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1_.   Assume that the person’s income bank credit, at the time this Module starts applying to the person, is an opening balance of zero.

_Step 2_.   If, for the person’s first income bank fortnight, the person has an income credit under point 1067L-E3, add it to the opening balance.

_Step 3_.   For each subsequent income bank fortnight of the person, up to but not including the fortnight in question, either:

               (a)     if the person has an income credit for that fortnight under point 1067L-E3—add it to the balance of the person’s income bank credit in respect of all the previous fortnights, but not so as to increase the balance beyond $6,000; or

               (b)     if the person has, in respect of that fortnight, drawn from the person’s income bank credit under point 1067L-E4—deduct from that balance the amount drawn, but not so as to reduce the balance below zero.

              The result is the person’s income bank credit for the fortnight in question.</div>

Income credit

   1067L-E3  For the purposes of point 1067L-E2, if the amount that would, apart from this Module, be the person’s ordinary income for an income bank fortnight of the person is less than $230:

                     (a)  the person has an income credit for that fortnight; and

                     (b)  the income credit is an amount equal to the difference between $230 and the first-mentioned amount.

Drawing from income bank credit

   1067L-E4  For the purposes of point 1067L-E2, if the amount that would, apart from this Module, be the person’s ordinary income for an income bank fortnight of the person is greater than $230:

                     (a)  the person is taken to have drawn from the person’s income bank credit in respect of that fortnight; and

                     (b)  the amount drawn is taken to be an amount equal to the difference between the first-mentioned amount and $230.

Income bank fortnight

   1067L-E5  For the purposes of this Module, an income bank fortnight of a person is any fortnight in respect of which an austudy payment may be payable to the person.

#### Module F—Remote area allowance

Remote area allowance—person physically in remote area

   1067L-F1  An amount by way of remote area allowance is to be added to a person’s rate of austudy payment if:

                     (a)  the person’s rate of austudy payment apart from this point is greater than nil; and

                     (b)  the person’s usual place of residence is situated in the remote area; and

                     (c)  the person is physically present in the remote area.

Note 1:       For **_remote area_** see subsection 14(1).

Note 2:       A person may be considered to be physically present in a remote area during temporary absences (see subsection 14(2)).

Rate of remote area allowance

   1067L-F2  A person’s rate of remote area allowance is worked out using Table F. Work out which family situation in the table applies to the person. The rate of remote area allowance is the corresponding amount in column 3 plus the additional corresponding amount in column 4 for each child of the person, being a child to whom point 1067L-F8 applies.

# Chapter 2B—Student Financial Supplement Scheme

##### <a id="1061ZW"></a>1061ZW  Object of this Chapter

                   The object of this Chapter is to provide for the establishment by the Minister of a Student Financial Supplement Scheme enabling certain tertiary students to obtain a repayable financial supplement by entering into a contract for that purpose with a financial corporation that participates in the scheme.

##### <a id="1061ZX"></a>1061ZX  Minister may establish a Student Financial Supplement Scheme

             (1)  The Minister may, by instrument in writing, establish a Student Financial Supplement Scheme under which certain tertiary students to whom youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement is payable, or to whom youth allowance would be payable except for the youth allowance parental income test, can obtain a repayable financial supplement by entering into a contract for that purpose with a financial corporation that participates in the scheme.

             (2)  The Minister may, from time to time, vary or revoke the scheme by instrument in writing.

             (3)  The scheme, whether as originally established or as varied, must include provisions of the kind mentioned in section 1061ZY, in addition to satisfying the requirements of subsection (1).

             (4)  An instrument under this section has effect according to its terms, despite anything else in this Act or in any other Act.

             (5)  An instrument under this section is a disallowable instrument.

##### <a id="1061ZY"></a>1061ZY  Essential provisions of the scheme

             (1)  The scheme must provide for the reduction of the rate of youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement payable to a student who obtains financial supplement. It must also contain provisions under which the amount of supplement that the student is eligible to obtain depends on the total rate of youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement that the student chooses to receive. The provisions must allow the student to choose to repay some or all of the youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement, or to receive a lower rate of payment of such allowance, payment or supplement, in order to receive a higher amount of financial supplement.

             (2)  The scheme must provide that the student is not liable to pay interest to the financial corporation in respect of financial supplement received by the student, but must provide for payment by the Commonwealth, without cost to the student, of a subsidy to the financial corporation that includes an amount in lieu of interest.

             (3)  The scheme must provide for the amount of the financial supplement that has to be repaid under a contract to be indexed on 1 June in the year next following the year in which the contract is entered into, and on 1 June in each subsequent year. The amount by which the supplement is increased by indexation is to be owed by the student to the Commonwealth and not to the financial corporation. Under the scheme, the student is to be entitled, but not required, to make early repayments in respect of the supplement during the period of the contract. The scheme is to provide for a discount for any repayments before the end of that period.

             (4)  The scheme must provide that if financial supplement paid to a student is not repaid in full before the end of the period of the contract, the obligation to repay the outstanding amount of the supplement is assigned to the Commonwealth, and the indexed amount is repayable by the student to the Commonwealth through the taxation system when the student’s income reaches a specified level.

##### <a id="1061ZZ"></a>1061ZZ  Other matters that may be covered in a section 1061ZX instrument

                   Without limiting section 1061ZX, an instrument under that section may include any provisions that are necessary or convenient for carrying out or giving effect to the scheme, including, for example, provisions relating to the following matters:

                     (b)  the circumstances in which youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement is taken to be payable to a person, and the rate at which it is taken to be so payable, for the purposes of the scheme;

                     (d)  the amount of financial supplement that a student can obtain, and the effect of payment of financial supplement on the student’s rate of youth allowance, austudy payment or pensioner education supplement;

                     (e)  the payment of financial supplement;

                      (f)  the protection of financial supplement;

                     (k)  the application of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ in relation to rights and liabilities arising under or out of financial supplement contracts;

                      (l)  the exemption from State and Territory taxes of assignments and other acts and transactions under the scheme;

                    (m)  the review of decisions made under the scheme and the effect of decisions made on such reviews;

                     (n)  the delegation of powers conferred on the Secretary under the scheme;

                     (o)  transitional matters arising out of the enactment of this Chapter, the establishment of the scheme and the consequential amendment of Part 4A of the _Student Assistance Act 1973_.

             (5)  Interest is not payable under this section in relation to the recoverable amount in relation to any period during which a decision under section 39A is in force in relation to the recoverable amount unless the decision provides that interest is to be so payable or an instalment is not paid in accordance with the decision.

                     (b)  apportion any amount recovered under this section in relation to the debts in such proportion as the Secretary considers appropriate.

## 39  Section 43

Repeal the section, substitute:

### Division 3—Non-recovery of debts

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Secretary may write off debt

Writing off debt

             (1)  The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, write off a debt.

Class of debts

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the Secretary may write off debts that are included in a class of debts determined by the Minister by notice published in the _Gazette_.

When decision takes effect

             (3)  A decision made under subsection (1) takes effect:

                     (a)  if a day is stated in the decision as the day on which the decision takes effect—on the day so stated (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the decision is made); or

                     (b)  if a day is not so stated in the decision—on the day on which the decision is made.

Note:          If the Secretary writes off a debt, this means an administrative decision has been made that, in the present circumstances, there is no point in trying to recover the debt. In law, however, this debt still exists and may later be pursued.

##### <a id="43A"></a>43A  Power to waive Commonwealth’s right to recover debt

Secretary’s limited power to waive

             (1)  The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, waive the Commonwealth’s right to recover the whole or a part of a debt only in the circumstances described in section 43B, 43C, 43D, 43E or 43F.

When waiver takes effect

             (2)  A waiver takes effect:

                     (a)  if a day is stated in the waiver as the day on which the waiver takes effect—on the day so stated (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the decision to waive is made); or

                     (b)  if a day is not so stated in the waiver—on the day on which the decision to waive is made.

Note:          If the Secretary waives the Commonwealth’s right to recover all or part of a debt, the waiver is a permanent bar to recovery of that debt or that part of the debt—that debt or that part of the debt effectively ceases to exist.

##### <a id="43B"></a>43B  Waiver of debt arising from error

Administrative error

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of a debt that is attributable solely to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth if the debtor received in good faith the payment or payments that gave rise to that proportion of the debt.

Note:          Subsection (1) does not allow waiver of part of a debt that was caused partly by administrative error and partly by one or more other factors (such as error by the debtor).

Circumstances under which subsection (1) applies

             (2)  Subsection (1) only applies if:

                     (a)  the debt is not raised within a period of 6 weeks from the first payment that caused the debt; or

                     (b)  if the debt arose because a person has complied with an obligation to provide information or documents to the Department under this Act, the debt is not raised within a period of 6 weeks from the end of the period within which the person was required to comply with that obligation;

whichever is the later.

Underestimating value of property

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a debt arose because the debtor, the debtor’s partner, or the debtor’s parent or parents underestimated the value of particular property; and

                     (b)  the estimate was made in good faith; and

                     (c)  the value of the property was not able to be easily determined when the estimate was made;

the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of the debt attributable to the underestimate.

Proportion of a debt

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, a proportion of a debt may be 100% of the debt.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="parent"></a>**_parent_**, in relation to a person, means:

                     (a)  if the person is not an adopted child—a natural parent of the person; or

                     (b)  if the person is an adopted child—an adoptive parent of the person.

                    <a name="partner"></a>**_partner_** has the same meaning as in the _Social Security Act 1991_.

##### <a id="43C"></a>43C  Waiver of debt relating to an offence

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a debtor has been convicted of an offence that gave rise to a proportion of a debt; and

                     (b)  the court indicated in sentencing the debtor that it imposed a longer custodial sentence on the debtor because he or she was unable or unwilling to pay the debt;

the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of the debt.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, a proportion of a debt may be 100% of the debt.

##### <a id="43D"></a>43D  Waiver of small debt

                   The Secretary must waive the right to recover a debt if:

                     (a)  the debt is, or is likely to be, less than $50; and

                     (b)  it is not cost effective for the Commonwealth to take action to recover the debt.

##### <a id="43E"></a>43E  Waiver in relation to settlements

Settlement of civil action

             (1)  If the Commonwealth has agreed to settle a civil action against a debtor for recovery of a debt for less than the full amount of the debt, the Secretary must waive the right to recover the difference between the debt and the amount that is the subject of the settlement.

Settlement of proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

             (2)  If the Secretary has agreed to settle proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal relating to recovery of a debt on the basis that the debtor will pay less than the full amount of the debt, the Secretary must waive the right to recover the difference between the debt and the amount that is the subject of the settlement.

Waiver where at least 80% of debt recovered and debtor cannot pay more

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth has recovered at least 80% of the original value of a debt from a debtor; and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth and the debtor agree that the recovery is in full satisfaction of the whole of the debt; and

                     (c)  the debtor cannot repay a greater proportion of the debt;

the Secretary must waive the right to recover the remaining 20% or less of the value of the original debt.

Agreement for part-payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

             (4)  If the Secretary and a debtor agree that the debtor’s debt will be fully satisfied if the debtor pays the Commonwealth an agreed amount less than the amount of the debt outstanding at the time of the agreement (the **_unpaid amount_**), the Secretary must waive the right to recover the difference between the unpaid amount and the agreed amount.

Limits on agreement to accept part-payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

             (5)  The Secretary must not make an agreement described in subsection (4) unless the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the debtor cannot repay more of the debt than the agreed amount; and

                     (b)  the agreed amount is at least the present value of the unpaid amount repaid in instalments whose amount and timing are determined by the Secretary; and

                     (c)  it would take at least 12 months to recover the unpaid amount under this Part if subsection (4) did not apply.

Formula for working out present value of unpaid amount

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), the **_present value of the unpaid amount_** is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00285/Html/D11BAE1FDCCEA431CA257705001FA710/$FILE/SocialSecLegAmendYouthAllowConseqRelatMeasures1998_image018.gif)

where:

                    <a name="annual-repay"></a>**_annual repayment_** is the amount of the debt that the Secretary believes would be recovered under this Part in a year if subsection (4) did not apply in relation to the debt.

                    <a name="interest"></a>**_interest_** is the annual rate of interest specified by the Minister in a written notice.

                    <a name="repay-period"></a>**_repayment period_** is the number of years needed to repay the unpaid amount if repayments equal to the annual repayment were made each year.

Example:    

Facts:         Terry owed a debt of $8,000 to the Commonwealth. He has repaid $2,000 with the remaining debt being $6,000.

                   Terry, with the assistance of his mother, offers to make a single payment of $4,700 in full satisfaction, leaving $1,300 of the debt unpaid. Without Terry’s mother’s assistance, Terry can only pay fortnightly instalments amounting to $1,200 a year and, at that rate, would take 5 years to pay the remaining $6,000.

                   Assume that the Minister has specified an interest rate of 10%.

Result:       The present value of the unpaid amount of $6,000 to be repaid in 5 years at a 10% interest rate is worked out as follows:

                   ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00285/Html/D11BAE1FDCCEA431CA257705001FA710/$FILE/SocialSecLegAmendYouthAllowConseqRelatMeasures1998_image019.gif)

                   As the proposed payment of $4,700 is more than the present value of the unpaid amount (which is $4,548 as shown), and as the other conditions in subsection (5) apply, the Secretary may accept Terry’s offer and make an agreement with him as described in subsection (4).

                   If the Secretary makes the agreement, the Secretary must, in accordance with subsection (4), waive the remaining $1,300 of the debt (being the difference between the unpaid amount of $6,000 and the agreed amount of $4,700).

Notice is a disallowable instrument

             (7)  A notice described in the definition of **_interest_** in subsection (6) is a disallowable instrument for the purpose of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="43F"></a>43F  Waiver in special circumstances

                   The Secretary may waive the right to recover all or part of a debt if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the debt did not result wholly or partly from the debtor or another person knowingly:

                              (i)  making a false statement or a false representation; or

                             (ii)  failing or omitting to comply with a provision of this Act; and

                     (b)  there are special circumstances (other than financial hardship alone) that make it desirable to waive; and

                     (c)  it is more appropriate to waive than to write off the debt or part of the debt.

Note:          Section 43 allows the Secretary to write off a debt on behalf of the Commonwealth.
