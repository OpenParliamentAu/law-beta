**</center>  **Table A**

**Application, saving or transitional provisions**

_Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Act 1998_(No.&#160;17, 1998)

**34  Application**

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

		The amendment made by this Part applies to the calculation of adjusted

taxable income for the financial year that began on 1&#160;July 1996 or a later

financial year.

 </dl></dl>

_A New Tax System (Closely Held Trusts) Act 1999_ (No.&#160;70, 1999)

**Schedule&#160;2** **16  Application** The amendment made by this Part applies to the calculation of adjusted taxable income for the financial year that began on 1&#160;July 1998 or a later financial year.

_Superannuation Contributions and Termination Payments Taxes Legislation Amendment Act 1999_ (No.&#160;131, 1999)

**Schedule&#160;1** **43  Transitional&#151;superannuation providers to give corrective statements** (1)	If a superannuation provider has, before the commencement of this item, given a statement to the Commissioner under section&#160;13 of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ that did not comply with the requirements that would have applied if the amendments made by items of this Schedule that are taken to have commenced on 5&#160;June 1997 had been in force, the provider must give to the Commissioner not later than a date fixed by the Minister by notice published in the _Gazette_, in substitution for the first-mentioned statement, a further statement that complies with those requirements.
 (2)	A superannuation provider who contravenes subsection&#160;(1) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of not more than 60 penalty units.

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note 1:	Chapter&#160;2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the

general principles of criminal responsibility. Note 2:	The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section&#160;4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.  </dl></dl>

(3)	Chapter&#160;2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to offences against subsection&#160;(2).

**44  Transitional&#151;retrospective objections**

If a notice of assessment was given to a member or a superannuation provider before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent:

	(a)	if the member or provider did not object against the assessment before that day, then, for the purpose of calculating under section&#160;14ZW of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ the period within which the member or provider may object against the assessment, the notice is taken to have been served on that day; and
 	(b)	if the member or provider objected against the assessment before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent, the member or provider may make a further objection against the assessment and, for the purpose of calculating under section&#160;14ZW of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ the period within which the member or provider may make the further objection against the assessment, the notice is taken to have been served on that day.

**45  Transitional&#151;amendments of assessments**

Nothing in section&#160;17A of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ prevents the amendment of an assessment for the purpose of giving effect:

	(a)	to any amendment made by this Schedule or to item&#160;43 or 44; or
 	(b)	to anything done under a provision of that Act as amended by this Schedule or under item&#160;43 or 44.

_A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Act 1999_ (No.&#160;179, 1999)
