An Act relating to the assessment and collection of superannuation contributions tax, and for related purposes
Part 1—Preliminary
  
1  Short title [see Note 1]
		This Act may be cited as the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997.
2  Commencement [see Note 1]
		This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.
3  Act to bind Crown
	(1)	This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island.
	(2)	Nothing in this Act permits the Crown to be prosecuted for an offence.
4  Extension to Territories
		This Act extends to Norfolk Island, the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the Territory of Christmas Island.
5  Object of Act
		The object of this Act is to provide for the assessment and collection of the superannuation contributions surcharge payable on surchargeable contributions for high‑income individuals.
6  Simplified outline of Act
		The following is a simplified outline of this Act.
(a)	If there are surchargeable contributions for a member for the 1996‑97 financial year or a later financial year, the Commissioner will calculate the member’s adjusted taxable income for the financial year.
(b)	If the amount calculated is greater than the surcharge threshold amount, the Commissioner will calculate the rate of surcharge and the amount of the surcharge payable on the surchargeable contributions. Only surchargeable contributions calculated for a period after 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996 are subject to surcharge.
(c)	For a defined benefits superannuation scheme, the surcharge is payable on an amount calculated to be the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.
(d)	If surcharge is payable for a member for a financial year under an assessment made before 23 March 1999, an advance instalment of one‑half of the surcharge is payable on account of surcharge payable for the member for the next financial year. However, no instalment is payable if the contributions for the next financial year are held under an unfunded defined benefits superannuation scheme.
(e)	If, after the assessment of surcharge, the member’s adjusted taxable income is found to be different from the amount that was previously calculated or the surchargeable contributions are found to be different from the amount on which the assessment was based:
	(i)	if the person who was liable to pay the assessed surcharge is still the holder of the contributions—the Commissioner may amend the assessment; or
	(ii)	otherwise—the Commissioner may make a further assessment of surcharge.
(f)	The holder of a member’s surchargeable contributions for a financial year is liable to pay:
	(i)	the surcharge on those contributions; and
	(ii)	if the liability to pay the surcharge arose under an assessment made before 23 March 1999—any advance instalment on the member’s surchargeable contributions for the next financial year;
	within prescribed periods.
(g)	However, if the holder is a superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) provider, the surcharge is not payable until benefits become payable.
(h)	If liability for surcharge is increased as a result of an amendment of an assessment or the making of a further assessment, interest is payable on the additional surcharge.
(i)	Either a superannuation provider or a member may object against an assessment of surcharge in the way set out in Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 for objecting against assessments of income tax.
(j)	A late payment penalty applies if surcharge or an advance instalment is not paid on time.

Part 2—Liability to surcharge and advance instalments
  
7  Superannuation contributions surcharge
Financial years to which surcharge applies
	(1)	Superannuation contributions surcharge is payable on a member’s surchargeable contributions for the financial year that began on 1 July 1996 or a later financial year.
No surcharge is payable unless adjusted taxable income is greater than surcharge threshold
	(2)	Surcharge is not payable for a financial year unless the member’s adjusted taxable income for the financial year is greater than the surcharge threshold for the financial year.
No surcharge is payable by residents of external Territories
	(3)	Surcharge is not payable for a financial year if the person who would be liable to pay the surcharge is the trustee of a Territory trust, a Territory company or a Territory resident for the purposes of Division 1A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act as it applies to the year of income that comprises that financial year.
Note:	In certain other circumstances surcharge is not payable (see subsection 10(4)).
No surcharge is payable if surcharge is payable under another Act
	(4)	Surcharge is not payable on a member’s surchargeable contributions if surcharge is payable on those contributions under the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997.
7A  Adjusted taxable income—first case
	(1)	This section applies to a member for a financial year if:
	(a)	no payments that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act because of paragraph (a) of the definition of eligible termination payment in subsection 27A(1) of that Act were made to or for the member in the financial year; or
	(b)	one or more such payments were so made but the total of the reduced amounts of the payments (other than payments that were rolled over before 1 July 1997) was equal to or greater than the amount specified in subsection 5(2) of the Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997 as altered under section 7 of that Act for the financial year.
	(2)	The reduced amount of an eligible termination payment is the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment the amount of any post‑June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.
	(3)	The adjusted taxable income of the member for the financial year is the sum of:
	(a)	the member’s taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year less any amounts included in the member’s assessable income of that year of income:
	(i)	that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act (other than amounts that were such payments because of paragraph (a) of the definition of eligible termination payment in subsection 27A(1) of that Act); or
	(ii)	that were so included under section 26AC or under subsection 26AD(2), (3) or (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in respect of a bona fide redundancy amount, an early retirement scheme amount or an invalidity amount as defined in section 159S of that Act; and
	(b)	in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996 or the following financial year—the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring subsection 271‑105(1) of Schedule 2F to the Income Tax Assessment Act; and
	(c)	in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1998 or a later financial year—the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring paragraphs 102UK(2)(b) and 102UM(2)(b) of, and subsection 271‑105(1) of Schedule 2F to, the Income Tax Assessment Act; and
	(d)	the member’s surchargeable contributions for the financial year; and
	(e)	in respect of a financial year beginning on or after 1 July 1999—if the member is an employee (within the meaning of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986) who has a reportable fringe benefits total (as defined in that Act) for the year of income comprising the financial year—the reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income.
7B  Adjusted taxable income—second case
	(1)	This section applies to a member for a financial year if:
	(a)	one or more payments that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act because of paragraph (a) of the definition of eligible termination payment in subsection 27A(1) of that Act were made to or for the member in the financial year; and
	(b)	the total of the reduced amounts of the payments (other than payments that were rolled over before 1 July 1997) was less than the amount specified in subsection 5(2) of the Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997 as altered under section 7 of that Act for the financial year.
	(2)	The reduced amount of an eligible termination payment is the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment the amount of any post‑June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.
	(3)	The adjusted taxable income of the member for the financial year is the sum of:
	(a)	the member’s taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year less any of the following amounts included in the member’s assessable income of that year of income:
	(i)	amounts that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act;
	(ii)	amounts that were so included under section 26AC or under subsection 26AD(2), (3) or (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in respect of a bona fide redundancy amount, an early retirement scheme amount or an invalidity amount as defined in section 159S of that Act; and
	(b)	in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996 or the following financial year—the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring subsection 271‑105(1) of Schedule 2F to the Income Tax Assessment Act; and
	(c)	in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1998 or a later financial year—the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring paragraphs 102UK(2)(b) and 102UM(2)(b) of, and subsection 271‑105(1) of Schedule 2F to, the Income Tax Assessment Act; and
	(d)	in respect of each eligible termination payment referred to in subsection (1)—whichever of the following amounts is appropriate:
	(i)	if the post‑20 August 1996 period is less than 365 days—the amount (excluding any cents, cent or fraction of a cent included in that amount) worked out using the formula:

	(ii)	otherwise—the amount (excluding any cents, cent or fraction of a cent included in that amount) worked out using the formula:

		where:
		ETP means:
	(a)	if no part of the payment was rolled‑over—so much of the amount of the payment as is included in the member’s taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year; or
	(b)	if any of the payment was rolled‑over—the sum of:
	(i)	so much of the part (if any) of the payment that was not rolled‑over as is included in the member’s taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year; and
	(ii)	so much of the part of the payment that was rolled‑over after 30 June 1997 as would have been included in that taxable income if that part of the payment had not been rolled‑over.
		post‑20 August 1996 period means the number of days in the period of the member’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made that occurred after 20 August 1996.
		total period means the number of days in the period of the member’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made; and
	(e)	the member’s surchargeable contributions for the financial year less any amounts included in those surchargeable contributions because of subparagraph 8(2)(c)(iii); and
	(f)	in respect of a financial year beginning on or after 1 July 1999—if the member is an employee (within the meaning of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986) who has a reportable fringe benefits total (as defined in that Act) for the year of income comprising the financial year—the reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income.
8  Surchargeable contributions
Application
	(1)	This section explains what are the surchargeable contributions of a member for a financial year and how they are to be worked out.
Member other than a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme
	(2)	If:
	(a)	there are any contributed amounts for a financial year in relation to a member other than a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme; and
	(b)	where the relevant superannuation provider is the trustee of a superannuation fund or of an approved deposit fund—the superannuation fund is a complying superannuation fund or the approved deposit fund is a complying approved deposit fund, as the case may be, for the purposes of the year of income comprising the financial year;
the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year are the sum of:
	(c)	so much of the amounts referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of contributed amounts in section 43 as:
	(i)	are taxable contributions under subparagraph 274(1)(a)(i), (b)(ii), (ba)(i) or (ba)(iv) or paragraph 274(1)(d) or (e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act; or
	(ii)	are allowed as deductions to the member under section 82AAT of that Act; or
	(iii)	subject to subsection (2A), constitute amounts accrued after 20 August 1996 that are eligible termination payments under paragraph (a) of the definition of eligible termination payment in subsection 27A(1) of that Act and are rolled‑over on or after 1 July 1997; and
	(d)	any amounts referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) or (iii) of the definition of contributed amounts in section 43.

where:
post‑20 August 1996 period means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made that occurred after 20 August 1996.
reduced amount of an eligible termination payment is the amount remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment any post‑June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.
total period means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made.
Member of defined benefits superannuation scheme
	(3)	The surchargeable contributions for a financial year of a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme are the amounts that constitute the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.
Value of benefits and expenses—financial year earlier than 1999‑2000 financial year
	(4)	The actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme for the 1996‑97 financial year or for either of the next 2 financial years is the amount worked out using the formula:

where:
annual salary means:
	(a)	if paragraph (b) does not apply—the amount that is the member’s annual salary for the financial year; or
	(b)	if another amount is taken to be the member’s annual salary for the purposes of the scheme as it applies to the member for the financial year—that other amount.
notional surchargeable contributions factor means the factor applying to the member for the financial year worked out by an eligible actuary in accordance with:
	(a)	the method set out in Superannuation Contributions Ruling SCR 97/1; or
	(b)	if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—the method so approved.
Value of benefits and expenses—1999‑2000 financial year or a later financial year
	(5)	The actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme for the 1999‑2000 financial year or a later financial year is an amount worked out using:
	(a)	the method set out in the regulations, being a method that excludes contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or
	(b)	if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—the method so approved.
Regulations
	(6)	Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (5)(a) may specify, or make provision for the Commissioner to specify in writing, different methods in relation to different superannuation schemes, different classes of superannuation schemes or different classes of members of a superannuation scheme.
Transitional provision for 1996‑97 financial year
	(7)	For the 1996‑97 financial year, a member’s surchargeable contributions are to be worked out only for the part of that financial year that started immediately after 7.30 pm by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory on 20 August 1996.
8A  Holder of surchargeable contributions of a member
Application
	(1)	This section explains who is to be regarded as the holder of the surchargeable contributions of a member for a particular financial year in respect of which surcharge is payable on those contributions.
Where there are contributed amounts and no payment of benefit has been made
	(1A)	This section is subject to section 10A.
	(2)	Subject to subsection (3), if:
	(a)	there were any contributed amounts in respect of a member for a financial year; and
	(b)	a lump sum has not been paid, and a pension or annuity has not begun to be paid, to or in respect of the member by the relevant superannuation provider;
a reference in this Act to the holder of the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year is a reference to:
	(c)	if only one superannuation provider holds the contributed amounts referred to in paragraph (a) at the time when an assessment is made of the surcharge payable on the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year—that superannuation provider; or
	(d)	otherwise—each superannuation provider who holds any of those contributed amounts at that time, to the extent to which the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year are included in the contributed amounts held by that provider.
What happens if member dies
	(3)	If:
	(a)	a superannuation provider would, apart from this subsection, be taken under subsection (2) to be the holder of surchargeable contributions of a member for the financial year; and
	(b)	the member died in the financial year;
subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the member in respect of the financial year and later financial years.
Where there are contributed amounts and a payment of benefit has been made
	(4)	If there were any contributed amounts in respect of a member for a financial year:
	(a)	that have been paid to a person other than a superannuation provider; or
	(b)	in respect of which a pension or annuity has begun to be paid;
a reference in this Act to the holder of the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year is a reference to the person to whom the amounts were paid or the pension or annuity has begun to be paid, as the case may be.
9  Surcharge threshold
Surcharge threshold for 1996‑97 financial year
	(1)	The surcharge threshold for the 1996‑97 financial year is $70,000.
Surcharge threshold for later financial year
	(2)	The surcharge threshold for a later financial year is the amount calculated using the formula:

where:
previous surcharge threshold means the surcharge threshold for the financial year immediately before the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.
indexation factor means the number calculated under subsections (4) and (5) for the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.
Rounding off of amount of surcharge threshold
	(3)	If an amount worked out for the purposes of subsection (2) is an amount of dollars and cents:
	(a)	if the number of cents is less than 50—the amount is to be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar; or
	(b)	otherwise—the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.
Indexation factor
	(4)	The indexation factor for a financial year is the number calculated, to 3 decimal places, using the formula:

where:
index number, for a quarter, means the estimate of full‑time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter published by the Australian Statistician.
current March year means the period of 12 months ending on 31 March immediately before the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.
previous March year means the period of 12 months immediately before the current March year.
Rounding up of indexation factor
	(5)	If the number calculated under subsection (4) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.001.
Change in index numbers
	(6)	If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded.
Surcharge threshold to be published
	(7)	The Commissioner must publish before, or as soon as practicable after, the start of the 1997‑98 financial year, and before the start of each later financial year, the surcharge threshold for the financial year.
Note:	For the purposes of this section, Australian Statistician means the Australian Statistician referred to in subsection 5(2) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975.
10  Liability to pay surcharge
Application
	(1)	This section identifies the person liable to pay the superannuation contributions surcharge on a member’s surchargeable contributions for a financial year.
	(1A)	This section is subject to section 10A.
Superannuation provider who holds surchargeable contributions liable to pay surcharge
	(2)	If a superannuation provider is the holder of the surchargeable contributions when an assessment of the surcharge on those contributions is made, the provider is liable to pay the surcharge.
Superannuation provider ceasing to be the holder of the contributions, or starting to pay pension or annuity, before receiving copy of assessment
	(3)	However, subsection (2) does not apply to a superannuation provider that ceases to be the holder of the contributions, or begins to pay a pension or annuity based on the contributions, before a notice of the assessment is given to it.
Contributions withdrawn or pension or annuity starts to be paid
	(4)	If:
	(a)	the contributions have been paid to a person other than a superannuation provider or a pension or annuity based on the contributions has begun to be paid; and
	(b)	no superannuation provider is liable under subsection (2) to pay the surcharge;
the following paragraphs have effect:
	(c)	if the surchargeable contributions were paid, or the pension or annuity began to be paid, to the member—the member is liable to pay the surcharge; or
	(ca)	if the surchargeable contributions were paid, or the pension or annuity began to be paid, to a person other than the member—the other person is liable to pay the surcharge; or
	(d)	otherwise—the surcharge is not payable.
10A  Payment splits or interest splits on marriage breakdown
Liability to pay surcharge
	(1)	If:
	(a)	in respect of an interest (the original interest) that a person has as a member:
	(i)	a payment split applies to a splittable payment; or
	(ii)	an interest in a superannuation fund, an approved deposit fund or an RSA is created for the non‑member spouse in relation to the original interest in circumstances prescribed by the regulations; or
	(iii)	an amount is transferred to a superannuation fund, an approved deposit fund or an RSA, in circumstances prescribed by the regulations, for the benefit of the non‑member spouse in relation to the original interest; and
	(b)	an assessment is then made that surcharge is payable on the surchargeable contributions of the member in respect of the original interest;
then:
	(c)	if a superannuation provider holds those contributions for the member—the provider is taken to be the holder of those contributions and liable to pay the surcharge; or
	(d)	otherwise—the member is taken to be the holder of those contributions and liable to pay the surcharge.
	(2)	In this section:
non‑member spouse has the same meaning as in Part VIIIB of the Family Law Act 1975.
payment split means a payment split under Part VIIIB of the Family Law Act 1975.
splittable payment has the same meaning as in Part VIIIB of the Family Law Act 1975.
11  Advance instalment of superannuation contributions surcharge
		If superannuation contributions surcharge is payable for a member for a financial year under an assessment made before 23 March 1999, an advance instalment of one‑half of the amount of the surcharge is payable on account of surcharge payable for the member for the following financial year.
Note:	In certain circumstances an advance instalment is not payable (see subsections 12(2) and (3).
12  Liability to pay advance instalment

Contributions held on 15 June in financial year by superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) provider
	(3)	If, on 15 June in the financial year, a superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) provider is the holder of the contributions, the advance instalment is not payable.
Contributions held on 15 June in financial year by any other superannuation provider
	(4)	If, on 15 June in the financial year, a superannuation provider other than a superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) provider is the holder of the contributions, the superannuation provider who was liable to pay the surcharge on the member’s surchargeable contributions for the preceding financial year is liable to pay the advance instalment.
