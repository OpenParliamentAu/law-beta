## Part 2—Liability to surcharge and advance instalments

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Superannuation contributions surcharge

Financial years to which surcharge applies

             (1)  Superannuation contributions surcharge is payable on a member’s surchargeable contributions for the financial year that began on 1 July 1996 or a later financial year that ends before 1 July 2005.

No surcharge is payable unless adjusted taxable income is greater than surcharge threshold

             (2)  Surcharge is not payable for a financial year unless the member’s adjusted taxable income for the financial year is greater than the surcharge threshold for the financial year.

No surcharge is payable by residents of external Territories

             (3)  Surcharge is not payable for a financial year if the person who would be liable to pay the surcharge is the trustee of a Territory trust, a Territory company or a Territory resident for the purposes of Division 1A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act as it applies to the year of income that comprises that financial year.

Note:          In certain other circumstances surcharge is not payable (see subsection 10(4)).

No surcharge is payable if surcharge is payable under another Act

             (4)  Surcharge is not payable on a member’s surchargeable contributions if surcharge is payable on those contributions under the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_.

##### <a id="7A"></a>7A  Adjusted taxable income—first case

             (1)  This section applies to a member for a financial year if:

                     (a)  no payments that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act because of paragraph (a) of the definition of **_eligible termination payment_** in subsection 27A(1) of that Act were made to or for the member in the financial year; or

                     (b)  one or more such payments were so made but the total of the reduced amounts of the payments (other than payments that were rolled over before 1 July 1997) was equal to or greater than the amount specified in subsection 5(2) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997_ as altered under section 7 of that Act for the financial year.

             (2)  The **_reduced amount_** of an eligible termination payment is the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment the amount of any post-June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.

             (3)  The adjusted taxable income of the member for the financial year is the sum of:

                     (a)  the member’s taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year less any amounts included in the member’s assessable income of that year of income:

                              (i)  that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act (other than amounts that were such payments because of paragraph (a) of the definition of **_eligible termination payment_** in subsection 27A(1) of that Act); or

                             (ii)  that were so included under section 26AC or under subsection 26AD(2), (3) or (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in respect of a bona fide redundancy amount, an early retirement scheme amount or an invalidity amount as defined in section 159S of that Act; and

                     (b)  in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996 or the following financial year—the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring subsection 271-105(1) of Schedule 2F to the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

                     (c)  in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1998 or a later financial year—the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring paragraphs 102UK(2)(b) and 102UM(2)(b) of, and subsection 271-105(1) of Schedule 2F to, the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

                     (d)  the member’s surchargeable contributions for the financial year, worked out ignoring subsection 8(8) of this Act and subsection 9(9) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_; and

                     (e)  in respect of a financial year beginning on or after 1 July 1999—if the member is an employee (within the meaning of the _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_) who has a reportable fringe benefits total (as defined in that Act) for the year of income comprising the financial year—the reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income.

##### <a id="7B"></a>7B  Adjusted taxable income—second case

             (1)  This section applies to a member for a financial year if:

                     (a)  one or more payments that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act because of paragraph (a) of the definition of **_eligible termination payment_** in subsection 27A(1) of that Act were made to or for the member in the financial year; and

                     (b)  the total of the reduced amounts of the payments (other than payments that were rolled over before 1 July 1997) was less than the amount specified in subsection 5(2) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997_ as altered under section 7 of that Act for the financial year.

             (2)  The **_reduced amount_** of an eligible termination payment is the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment the amount of any post-June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.

             (3)  The adjusted taxable income of the member for the financial year is the sum of:

                     (a)  the member’s taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year less any of the following amounts included in the member’s assessable income of that year of income:

                              (i)  amounts that were eligible termination payments for the purposes of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act;

                             (ii)  amounts that were so included under section 26AC or under subsection 26AD(2), (3) or (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in respect of a bona fide redundancy amount, an early retirement scheme amount or an invalidity amount as defined in section 159S of that Act; and

                     (b)  in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996 or the following financial year—the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring subsection 271-105(1) of Schedule 2F to the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

                     (c)  in respect of the financial year beginning on 1 July 1998 or a later financial year—the amount (if any) by which the amount worked out under paragraph (a) would be increased if it were instead worked out ignoring paragraphs 102UK(2)(b) and 102UM(2)(b) of, and subsection 271-105(1) of Schedule 2F to, the Income Tax Assessment Act; and

                     (d)  in respect of each eligible termination payment referred to in subsection (1)—whichever of the following amounts is appropriate:

                              (i)  if the post-20 August 1996 period is less than 365 days—the amount (excluding any cents, cent or fraction of a cent included in that amount) worked out using the formula:

                                          (i)  so much of the part (if any) of the payment that was not rolled-over as is included in the member’s taxable income of the year of income comprising the financial year; and

                                         (ii)  so much of the part of the payment that was rolled-over after 30 June 1997 as would have been included in that taxable income if that part of the payment had not been rolled-over.

                            **_post-20 August 1996 period_** means the number of days in the period of the member’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made that occurred after 20 August 1996.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Surchargeable contributions

Application

             (1)  This section explains what are the surchargeable contributions of a member for a financial year and how they are to be worked out.

                     (b)  where the relevant superannuation provider is the trustee of a superannuation fund or of an approved deposit fund—the superannuation fund is a complying superannuation fund or the approved deposit fund is a complying approved deposit fund, as the case may be, for the purposes of the year of income comprising the financial year;

the **_surchargeable contributions_** of the member for the financial year are the sum of:

                     (c)  so much of the amounts referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of **_contributed amounts_** in section 43 as:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006C00362/Html/C2517CE33559F5A0CA25719D000BD233/$FILE/image004.gif)

where:

                    <a name="post-20-august-1996-period"></a>**_post-20 August 1996 period_** means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made that occurred after 20 August 1996.

                    <a name="ruced-amount"></a>**_reduced amount_** of an eligible termination payment is the amount remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment any post-June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.

                    <a name="total-period"></a>**_total period_** means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made.

Member of defined benefits superannuation scheme

             (3)  The **_surchargeable contributions_** for a financial year of a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme are the amounts that constitute the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.

Value of benefits and expenses—financial year earlier than 1999-2000 financial year

             (4)  The **_actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of,_** a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme for the 1996-97 financial year or for either of the next 2 financial years is the amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006C00362/Html/C2517CE33559F5A0CA25719D000BD233/$FILE/image005.gif)

where:

                    <a name="annual-salari"></a>**_annual salary_** means:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—the amount that is the member’s annual salary for the financial year; or

                     (b)  if another amount is taken to be the member’s annual salary for the purposes of the scheme as it applies to the member for the financial year—that other amount.

                    <a name="notion-surcharg-contribut-factor"></a>**_notional surchargeable contributions factor_** means the factor applying to the member for the financial year worked out by an eligible actuary in accordance with:

                     (a)  the method set out in Superannuation Contributions Ruling SCR 97/1; or

                     (b)  if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_—the method so approved.

Value of benefits and expenses—1999-2000 financial year or a later financial year

             (5)  The **_actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of,_** a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme for the 1999-2000 financial year or a later financial year is an amount worked out using:

                     (a)  the method set out in the regulations, being a method that excludes Government co-contributions made under the _Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003_ and contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes Government co-contributions made under the _Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003_ and contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_—the method so approved.

Regulations

             (6)  Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (5)(a) may specify, or make provision for the Commissioner to specify in writing, different methods in relation to different superannuation schemes, different classes of superannuation schemes or different classes of members of a superannuation scheme.

Transitional provision for 1996-97 financial year

             (7)  For the 1996-97 financial year, a member’s surchargeable contributions are to be worked out only for the part of that financial year that started immediately after 7.30 pm by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory on 20 August 1996.

Reduced surchargeable contributions

             (8)  The amount of the **_surchargeable contributions_** of a member for a financial year is the amount worked out under subsection (2) or (3) (as appropriate), reduced by the amount worked out under subsection (9), if:

                     (a)  an eligible termination payment is made to the member in the financial year from the superannuation fund, approved deposit fund or RSA; and

                     (b)  the eligible termination payment has an excessive component.

             (9)  The amount of the reduction is worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Amount of the reduction_

_Step 1._   Work out the amount that would have been the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 83 component of the eligible termination payment if the amount of the excessive component of the eligible termination payment had been nil.

_Step 2._   Work out the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 83 component of the eligible termination payment.

_Step 3._   Subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 1.

_Step 4._   Divide the result of step 3 by 0.85.

_Step 5._   Subtract the result of step 3 from the result of step 4.

_Step 6._   Add the result of step 5 to the excessive component of the eligible termination payment.

_Step 7._   Identify the amount of the surchargeable contributions (apart from subsection (8)) of the member reported for the financial year by the entity that paid the eligible termination payment.

_Step 8._   Identify the lesser of the results of steps 6 and 7 (or either result if they are the same).</div>

             (1)  This section explains who is to be regarded as the holder of the surchargeable contributions of a member for a particular financial year in respect of which surcharge is payable on those contributions.

Where there are contributed amounts and no payment of benefit has been made

          (1A)  This section is subject to section 10A.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), if:

                     (a)  there were any contributed amounts in respect of a member for a financial year; and

                     (b)  a lump sum has not been paid, and a pension or annuity has not begun to be paid, to or in respect of the member by the relevant superannuation provider;

a reference in this Act to the **_holder_** of the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year is a reference to:

                     (c)  if only one superannuation provider holds the contributed amounts referred to in paragraph (a) at the time when an assessment is made of the surcharge payable on the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year—that superannuation provider; or

                     (d)  otherwise—each superannuation provider who holds any of those contributed amounts at that time, to the extent to which the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year are included in the contributed amounts held by that provider.

What happens if member dies

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a superannuation provider would, apart from this subsection, be taken under subsection (2) to be the holder of surchargeable contributions of a member for the financial year; and

                     (b)  the member died in the financial year;

subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the member in respect of the financial year and later financial years.

Where there are contributed amounts and a payment of benefit has been made

             (4)  If there were any contributed amounts in respect of a member for a financial year:

                     (a)  that have been paid to a person other than a superannuation provider; or

                     (b)  in respect of which a pension or annuity has begun to be paid;

a reference in this Act to the **_holder_** of the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year is a reference to the person to whom the amounts were paid or the pension or annuity has begun to be paid, as the case may be.

Rounding up of indexation factor

             (5)  If the number calculated under subsection (4) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.001.

Change in index numbers

             (6)  If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded.

Surcharge threshold to be published

             (7)  The Commissioner must publish before, or as soon as practicable after, the start of the 1997-98 financial year, and before the start of each later financial year (being a financial year that ends before 1 July 2005), the surcharge threshold for the financial year.

             (3)  If the financial year is the 1999-2000 financial year or a later financial year, the superannuation provider must pay to the Commissioner, not later than 7 days after the day on which the statement is given to the Commissioner under paragraph (2)(d), an amount equal to the total of the amounts of surcharge so calculated to be payable in respect of all the members.

How amounts paid are to be applied

             (4)  When an amount is paid to the Commissioner by a superannuation provider under subsection (3):

                     (a)  the Commissioner is to apply the amount in reduction of any surcharge that is assessed to be payable on the member’s surchargeable contributions for the financial year; and

                     (b)  if the amount exceeds the surcharge:

                              (i)  the excess is to be applied in reduction of any liability of the provider in respect of the member under this Act; and

                             (ii)  any amount remaining is to be paid to the provider.

Offence

             (5)  A superannuation provider who contravenes this section is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of not more than 60 penalty units.

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

Superannuation provider not required to give information about calculation of adjusted taxable income

             (6)  A member is not required to give to a superannuation provider any information relevant to the calculation of the member’s adjusted taxable income for a financial year.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Deferment of liability for surcharge payable by superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) providers

Deferment of liability for surcharge

             (1)  This section makes provision for the deferment of the liability of a superannuation (unfunded defined benefits) provider to pay surcharge on the surchargeable contributions of a member of the relevant unfunded defined benefits superannuation scheme, and for interest to accrue on the deferred amount.

Accounts to be kept

             (2)  The provider must keep a surcharge debt account for each member.

Account to be debited for surcharge

             (3)  The provider must debit the account for surcharge assessed to be payable on the member’s surchargeable contributions.

Interest to be debited

             (4)  If the member’s account is in debit at the end of a financial year, the provider must debit the account for interest on the amount by which the account is in debit, calculated at the Treasury bond rate for the last day of the financial year for bonds with a 10 year term.

Rate of interest

             (5)  The **_Treasury bond rate_** for the last day of a financial year for bonds with a 10 year term is:

                     (a)  if any Treasury bonds with that term were issued on that day—the annual yield on those bonds; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the annual yield on Treasury bonds with that term, as published by the Reserve Bank of Australia for that day.

Payment to be made when benefit becomes payable

             (6)  Subject to subsection (6A), when a lump sum, or a pension or annuity, becomes payable by a superannuation provider for the benefit of a member whose account is in debit, the provider must pay to the Commissioner, within one month after the day on which the lump sum, or the first instalment of pension or annuity, becomes payable, the amount by which the account is in debit. The payment discharges the provider’s liability for the surcharge.

          (6A)  If:

                     (a)  a payment split applies to a splittable payment in respect of an interest that a person has as a member; and

                     (b)  the splittable payment becomes payable in circumstances where the member’s surcharge account is in debit;

then the superannuation provider concerned must pay to the Commissioner, within one month after the day the splittable payment became payable, the amount by which the account is in debit (which discharges the provider’s liability for the surcharge).

Surcharge debt may be reduced

             (7)  The member may make payments to the provider for the purpose of reducing the amount by which the surcharge debt account is in debit.

             (8)  If a member makes a payment under subsection (7), the provider must:

                     (a)  credit the payment to the surcharge debt account; and

                     (b)  acknowledge receipt of the payment to the member; and

                     (c)  advise the member of the revised balance of the surcharge debt account.

             (9)  A payment received by the provider under subsection (7) must be forwarded to the Commissioner within one month of receipt.

Offences

           (10)  A body corporate that contravenes this section is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of not more than 300 penalty units.

Note:          Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

                             (ii)  any amount remaining is to be paid to the holder of the contributions.

Repayment of advance instalment if no surcharge

             (3)  If no surcharge is assessed on the contributions:

                     (b)  any amount remaining is to be paid to the holder of the contributions.

##### <a id="17A"></a>17A  Periods within which assessments may be made

General provision

             (1)  The Commissioner may, subject to this section, at any time amend an assessment of surcharge on a member’s surchargeable contributions by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner thinks necessary, even though surcharge has been paid in respect of the assessment. Such an amendment may be made on the Commissioner’s own initiative or at the request of the member or the relevant superannuation provider.

Period for making further amendment

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an assessment has been amended in any particular in a way that effected a reduction in the amount of surcharge payable; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of making the amendment, the Commissioner accepted a statement made by or on behalf of a member or a superannuation provider;

the Commissioner may, within 4 years from the date of service of the notice of the amended assessment, further amend the assessment in, or in respect of, that particular in a way that increases the amount of the surcharge payable to the extent that the Commissioner considers necessary.

Period where avoidance of surcharge

             (3)  Subject to this section, if there has been an avoidance of surcharge, the Commissioner may:

                     (a)  if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the avoidance of surcharge is due to fraud or evasion—at any time; or

                     (b)  in any other case—within 4 years from the date upon which the surcharge became due and payable under the assessment;

amend the assessment by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner thinks necessary to correct the assessment.

Period where amendment reduces surcharge

             (4)  An amendment effecting a reduction in the amount of surcharge payable under an assessment is not to be made after the end of 4 years from the date upon which the surcharge became due and payable under the assessment.

Application or request for extension of period

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the Commissioner has begun an examination of the affairs of a member or a superannuation provider; and

the Commissioner may, before the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection, apply to the Federal Court for an order extending, or request the member or provider to consent to the extension of, the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b).

Court may extend period

             (6)  If, on application made to the Federal Court of Australia in accordance with subsection (5), the Court is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable, or it was inappropriate, for the Commissioner to complete the examination within the period referred to in paragraph (5)(b) because of any action taken by the member or superannuation provider or any failure of the member or superannuation provider to take action that it would have been reasonable for the member or provider to take, the Court may make an order extending the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b) for such period as the Court considers appropriate.

Member or provider may extend period

             (7)  If a request is made to the member or superannuation provider in accordance with subsection (5), the member or provider may, by writing, consent to the extension of the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b) for such period as is specified in the instrument of consent.

Meaning of **take action**

             (8)  In subsection (6), a reference to action taken by a member or superannuation provider includes a reference to the institution by the member or provider of a proceeding before a court or tribunal.

Period for further amendment reducing surcharge

             (9)  If an assessment has, under this section, been amended in any particular, the Commissioner may, within 4 years from the date upon which surcharge became due under the amended assessment, make, in or in respect of that particular, such further amendment of the assessment as, in the Commissioner’s opinion, is necessary to effect such reduction in the amount of surcharge payable under the assessment as is just.

Case when subsection (9) does not apply

           (10)  Subsection (9) does not authorise the further amendment of an earlier further amendment of an assessment made under subsection (2).

Assessment following application by member or superannuation provider

           (11)  If:

(2)        A superannuation provider who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of not more than 60 penalty units.

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       The amount of a penalty unit is stated in section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_. If a body corporate is convicted of an offence, subsection 4B(3) of that Act allows a court to impose a fine that is not greater than 5 times the maximum fine that could be imposed by the court on an individual convicted of the same offence.

(3)        Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ applies to offences against subsection (2).

## 44  Transitional—retrospective objections

If a notice of assessment was given to a member or a superannuation provider before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent:

                     (a)  if the member or provider did not object against the assessment before that day, then, for the purpose of calculating under section 14ZW of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ the period within which the member or provider may object against the assessment, the notice is taken to have been served on that day; and

                     (b)  if the member or provider objected against the assessment before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent, the member or provider may make a further objection against the assessment and, for the purpose of calculating under section 14ZW of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ the period within which the member or provider may make the further objection against the assessment, the notice is taken to have been served on that day.

## 45  Transitional—amendments of assessments

Nothing in section 17A of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997_ prevents the amendment of an assessment for the purpose of giving effect:

                     (a)  to any amendment made by this Schedule or to item 43 or 44; or

                     (b)  to anything done under a provision of that Act as amended by this Schedule or under item 43 or 44.
