                     (b)  entitle the seafarer to be accompanied or represented by another person during the complaint process; and

                     (c)  comply with any other requirements prescribed by the regulations.

#### Subdivision C—Effect of other agreements on the work agreement

##### <a id="61AH"></a>61AH  Effect of collective agreement with the seafarers’ bargaining unit

             (1)  This section applies while a collective agreement made under section 11A between the owner of the ship and the seafarers’ bargaining unit for the ship is in force.

             (2)  The work agreement referred to in section 45A of the Navigation Act, to the extent that the work agreement applies to the seafarer while he or she is working on board the ship when it is used to engage in international trading, is taken to include the terms and conditions of the collective agreement.

Note:          It does not matter whether the work agreement was made before or after the collective agreement was made.

             (3)  However, a term or condition of the collective agreement that is included in the work agreement because of subsection (2) has no effect to the extent that it is less beneficial to the seafarer than another term or condition of the work agreement.

##### <a id="61AI"></a>61AI  Effect of other agreements

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  on or after the commencement of this section, the owner of the ship makes an agreement with another person or persons about the terms and conditions of employment or engagement of one or more seafarers working on board the ship when it is used to engage in international trading; and

                     (c)  the agreement is not a collective agreement made under section 11A.

             (2)  If the work agreement referred to in section 45A of the Navigation Act incorporates any of the terms or conditions of the agreement referred to in paragraph (1)(a), then those terms or conditions have no effect to the extent that they apply to the seafarer while he or she is working on board the ship when it is used to engage in international trading.

#### Subdivision D—Enforcement of work agreement in relation to wages and annual leave

##### <a id="61AJ"></a>61AJ  Wages to be paid

             (4)  If, after the Minister makes a determination under subsection (2), the ITF template agreement changes, then as soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of that:

                     (a)  the Minister must, by legislative instrument, revoke the determination made under subsection (2); and

Relevant court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty

             (3)  If the relevant court is satisfied that the person has contravened the civil penalty provision, the relevant court may order the person to pay such pecuniary penalty for the contravention as the relevant court determines to be appropriate.

Note:          Subsection (5) sets out the maximum penalty that the relevant court may order the person to pay.

             (4)  An order under subsection (3) is a **_civil penalty order_**.

Determining pecuniary penalty

##### <a id="61BB"></a>61BB  Civil enforcement of penalty

             (1)  A pecuniary penalty is a debt payable to the Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth.

             (2)  The Authority may enforce a civil penalty order as if it were an order made in civil proceedings against the person to recover a debt due by the person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.

##### <a id="61BC"></a>61BC  Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

             (1)  If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Division against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.

             (2)  However, the person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this Division in relation to the same conduct.

##### <a id="61BD"></a>61BD  Multiple contraventions

             (1)  A relevant court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if proceedings for the contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or are part of, a series of contraventions of the same or a similar character.

             (2)  However, the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered for each of the contraventions.

##### <a id="61BE"></a>61BE  Proceedings may be heard together

                   A relevant court may direct that 2 or more proceedings for civil penalty orders are to be heard together.

#### Subdivision B—Civil proceedings and criminal proceedings

##### <a id="61BH"></a>61BH  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

                   A relevant court may not make a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### <a id="61BI"></a>61BI  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

             (1)  Proceedings for a civil penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

                     (a)  criminal proceedings are commenced or have already been commenced against the person for an offence; and

                     (b)  the offence is constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  The proceedings for the order (the **_civil proceedings_**) may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the civil proceedings are dismissed.

##### <a id="61BJ"></a>61BJ  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

                   Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as conduct that would constitute a contravention of a civil penalty provision, regardless of whether a civil penalty order has been made against the person in relation to the contravention.

##### <a id="61BK"></a>61BK  Evidence given in civil proceedings not admissible in criminal proceedings

             (1)  Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if:

                     (a)  the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a civil penalty order against the individual for an alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

                     (b)  the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

             (2)  However, subsection (1) does not apply to criminal proceedings in relation to the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the civil penalty order.

#### Subdivision C—Miscellaneous

                     (e)  conspire with others to effect a contravention of a civil penalty provision.

Note:          Section 61BN (which provides that a person’s state of mind does not need to be proven in relation to a civil penalty provision) does not apply to this subsection.

             (2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) in relation to a civil penalty provision is taken to have contravened the provision.

##### <a id="61BM"></a>61BM  Mistake of fact

             (1)  A person is not liable to have a civil penalty order made against the person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if:

                     (a)  at or before the time of the conduct constituting the contravention, the person:

                              (i)  considered whether or not facts existed; and

                             (ii)  was under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts; and

                     (b)  had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted a contravention of the civil penalty provision.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be regarded as having considered whether or not facts existed if:

                     (a)  the person had considered, on a previous occasion, whether those facts existed in the circumstances surrounding that occasion; and

                     (b)  the person honestly and reasonably believed that the circumstances surrounding the present occasion were the same, or substantially the same, as those surrounding the previous occasion.

             (3)  A person who wishes to rely on a matter in subsection (1) or (2) in proceedings for a civil penalty order bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of section 61BM (mistake of fact).

##### <a id="61BO"></a>61BO  Civil penalty provisions contravened by employees, agents or officers

                   If an element of a civil penalty provision is done by an employee, agent or officer of a body corporate acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, the element must also be attributed to the body corporate.

##### <a id="61BP"></a>61BP  Continuing contraventions of civil penalty provisions

             (1)  If an act or thing is required under a civil penalty provision to be done:

                     (a)  within a particular period; or

                     (b)  before a particular time;

then the obligation to do that act or thing continues until the act or thing is done (even if the period has expired or the time has passed).

                     (a)  within a particular period; or

             (2)  The infringement notice must be given within 12 months after the day the contravention is alleged to have taken place.

             (3)  A single infringement notice must relate only to a single contravention of a single civil penalty provision unless subsection (4) applies.

             (4)  The Authority may give a person a single infringement notice relating to multiple contraventions of a single provision if:

                     (a)  the provision requires the person to do a thing within a particular period or before a particular time; and

(1)       The amendments made by Part 1 of this Schedule apply on and after commencement in relation to:

                     (a)  ships that are registered immediately before commencement; and

## 99  Transitioning the Register, registration and certificates

(1)       The register known as the Australian Register of Ships that was in existence under section 56 of the Registration Act immediately before commencement continues in existence (and may be dealt with) as if it were the Australian General Shipping Register referred to in subsection 56(1) of that Act (as amended by this Schedule).

(2)       If, immediately before commencement, a ship is registered in the Australian Register of Ships under section 18 of the Registration Act, then the registration of the ship continues in effect (and may be dealt with) as if the ship were registered in the Australian General Shipping Register under section 15E of that Act (as amended by this Schedule).

(3)       A reference to “the Australian Register of Ships” in:

                     (a)  a registration certificate granted before commencement under section 19 or 21 of the Registration Act; or

                     (b)  a provisional registration certificate granted before commencement under section 21, 22 or 22A of the Registration Act;

then the application is taken to have been made in accordance with section 15 of that Act (as amended by this Schedule).

## 101  Saving of regulations relating to registration

Regulations relating to applications for registration

(1)       Despite the repeal of section 15 of the Registration Act  by item 24 of this Schedule, regulations that:

                     (a)  were made for the purposes of that section; and

                     (b)  were in force immediately before commencement;

continue in force (and may be dealt with) as if they had been made for the purposes of section 15 of that Act (as amended by this Schedule).

Regulations relating to entry of particulars in the Register

(2)       Despite the repeal of section 18 of the Registration Act  by item 29 of this Schedule, regulations that:

                     (a)  were made for the purposes of that section; and

                     (b)  were in force immediately before commencement;

continue in force (and may be dealt with) as if they had been made for the purposes of section 15E of that Act (as amended by this Schedule).

                     (b)  were in force immediately before commencement;

continue in force (and may be dealt with) as if they had been made for the purposes of subsection 83(5) of that Act (as amended by this Schedule).

## 103  Saving of other regulations

Despite the amendment of sections 37, 47A, 58 and 65 and subsection 83(2) of the Registration Act by this Schedule, regulations that:

                     (a)  were made for the purposes of those provisions; and

                     (b)  were in force immediately before commencement;

continue in force (and may be dealt with) as if they had been made for the purposes of those provisions of that Act (as amended by this Schedule).

## 104  Transitioning references to “the Register” in regulations

A reference to “the Register” in regulations that:

                     (a)  were made for the purposes of a provision of the Registration Act; and
