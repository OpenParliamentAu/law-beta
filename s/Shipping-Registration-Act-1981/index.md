             (2)  Every caveat shall state the name and address of the caveator and shall contain a sufficient description to identify the ship or the share in the ship in which the caveator claims an interest and the interest claimed by the caveator and shall be signed by the caveator or by his or her solicitor or agent.

                     (b)  a dealing by a person as the mortgagee under a mortgage of a ship or a share in a ship, being a mortgage to the entry of which the caveator has consented or in respect of which the caveat has lapsed.

                   A person who lodges a caveat with the Registrar without reasonable cause is liable to pay to a person who has sustained damage thereby such compensation as is just and the compensation is recoverable in an action in a court of competent jurisdiction by the person who has sustained damage from the person who lodged the caveat.

the Registrar may, by notice in writing served on the registered agent or any owner of the ship, require him or her to furnish to the Registrar, within a specified period (not being less than 30 days) after the date of service of the notice, such information and documents relating to the ship as are specified in the notice.

          (2A)  If the Authority is of the opinion that the failure of a person to comply with a notice served upon him or her under subsection (1) or any information or document furnished to him or her by the Registrar justifies the giving of directions under this subsection, the Authority may, by notice in writing, give the Registrar such directions as it thinks fit with respect to the closure of the registration relating to the ship or with respect to any entry or amendment of an entry to be made in the Register.

             (3)  The Registrar shall comply with a direction given under subsection (2A) and, where the Authority directs the closure of the registration relating to a ship:

                     (a)  if the Authority states in the direction that it is of the opinion that the ship has been lost (whether actually or constructively), taken by an enemy, burnt or broken up—the Registrar shall make an entry in the Register of that statement, and the registration of the ship shall thereupon be deemed to be closed except so far as it relates to any unsatisfied mortgage of the ship; or

## Part VII—Transitional provisions

##### <a id="84"></a>84  Interpretation

                   In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears, **_commencing date_** means the date fixed under section 2.

##### <a id="85"></a>85  Additional operation of Part

                   Without prejudice to its effect apart from this section, this Part also has, by force of this section, the effect it would have if a reference in section 86 to a ship entitled to be registered were a reference to a ship other than a ship entitled to be registered.

##### <a id="86"></a>86  Ships registered in Australia under previous law deemed registered under this Act

             (1)  Every ship entitled to be registered that was, immediately before the commencing date, registered in accordance with the previous law at a port in Australia shall be deemed, on and from that date, to be registered under this Act.

             (2)  Any entry or record that, immediately before the commencing date, appeared in a register book kept at a port in Australia under the previous law in relation to a ship referred to in subsection (1) shall be deemed to be an entry or record in the Register in relation to that ship and to have been made on the date on which, and at the time when, it was made under the previous law.

##### <a id="87"></a>87  Transfer of registration from foreign ports of ships entitled to be registered

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), where a ship entitled to be registered was, immediately before the commencing date, registered in a foreign country, or at a port in a foreign country, under provisions of a law of that country corresponding with provisions of the previous law, or under provisions determined by the Registrar to be provisions that so correspond to an extent sufficient for the purposes of this section, the ship:

                     (a)  in the case of a ship permitted to be registered—may; or

                     (b)  in the case of a ship required to be registered—shall;

within 6 months after the commencing date, be registered under this Act by way of a transfer of the registration to the Register.

             (2)  An application for the registration of a ship under this section shall be made in accordance with the regulations.

             (3)  A ship shall not be registered under this section unless the person responsible for the maintenance of the foreign register concerned:

                              (i)  all the particulars entered in the foreign register in relation to the ship;

                             (ii)  the names of all the persons appearing in the foreign register to be interested in the ship, either as owners or mortgagees; and

                            (iii)  any instrument or other document relating to the ship, or a certified copy of such an instrument or document, made in accordance with a provision of the law of that foreign country corresponding with a provision of the previous law, being an instrument or document kept by the first-mentioned person; and

                     (b)  consents to the closing of the registration of the ship in that register.

             (4)  Until the expiration of 6 months after the commencing date, subsections 12(3) and (4) do not apply in relation to a ship to which subsection (1) applies, being a ship required to be registered, or in relation to the owner of such a ship.

             (5)  In this section, **_foreign register_** means the register book or books, or other similar documents or collections of documents, kept in accordance with provisions of a law of a foreign country relating to the registration of ships corresponding with the provisions of the previous law relating to the keeping of register books under the previous law.

##### <a id="88"></a>88  Instruments etc. made under previous law or corresponding foreign law continue in force

             (1)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4):

                     (a)  any instrument or other document made in accordance with a provision of the previous law and in effect immediately before the commencing date; and

                     (b)  any endorsement, memorandum or other note made in accordance with a provision of the previous law on any such instrument or document and in effect immediately before the commencing date;

has effect on and after that date as if it had been made in accordance with the corresponding provision of this Act.

has effect on and after that date as if it had been made in accordance with the corresponding provision of this Act.

             (3)  Where any instrument or other document referred to in subsection (1) or (2) is lodged with, or received by, the Registrar for the purposes of this Act and the Registrar is of the opinion that:

                     (a)  the instrument or document does not sufficiently comply with the requirements of this Act; or

                     (b)  it would be inappropriate to accept the instrument or document for the purposes of this Act;

he or she may refuse to accept the instrument or document for the purposes of this Act.

             (4)  Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to a certificate of mortgage or certificate of sale granted under section 39 of the previous law or under a corresponding provision of the law of a foreign country.

##### <a id="89"></a>89  Applications under previous law

                   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, where:

                     (a)  before the commencing date, an application was made under the previous law, but not finally dealt with; and

                     (b)  the Registrar is satisfied that the requirements of this Act relating to an application of the same kind are substantially similar to the requirements of the previous law;

the Registrar shall treat that application as if it had been made under this Act.

##### <a id="90"></a>90  Certificates of registry may be recalled

                   For the purpose of the issue of a registration certificate under this Act in respect of a ship deemed to be registered by virtue of section 86, the Registrar may recall the certificate of registry issued under the previous law in respect of the ship.

##### <a id="91"></a>91  Registers kept under previous law in Australia incorporated with Register

                   Each register book kept by a registrar of British ships at a port in Australia under the previous law shall be deemed to be part of the Register to be kept in pursuance of this Act, and any documents retained by such a registrar that are associated with the register book kept by him or her shall be retained by the Registrar and kept at the Registration Office.

##### <a id="92"></a>92  Verification of particulars—Registers kept under previous law etc.

             (1)  The Registrar may, by notice in writing served on the registered agent of a ship deemed to be registered by virtue of section 86, or, if there is no registered agent entered in the register in relation to that ship, the registered owner of that ship require him or her:

                     (a)  to verify, in such manner as is specified in the notice, any matter or particular appearing in the Register by virtue of section 91; or

                     (b)  to furnish such information and documents relating to the ship and its owner as are specified in the notice, being information and documents of the kind required in connection with, or in support of, an application for registration;

or to do both, within a specified period (not being less than 30 days) after the date of the notice.

             (2)  If the person on whom a notice in respect of a ship is served under subsection (1) fails to verify a matter or particular, or to furnish any information or documents, in accordance with the notice, the Authority may, by notice in writing given to the Registrar, unless it has information that leads it to believe that the ship may still be entitled to be registered, direct that the registration relating to the ship be closed and, upon receipt of such a notice by the Registrar, section 66 applies as if the ship had ceased to be entitled to be registered and the notice were a notice under subsection 66(1) stating that fact.

             (3)  Where, in relation to a ship, no entry or amendment of an entry has been made in the Register for such period as is prescribed for the purposes of this subsection, the Registrar may, by notice published in the _Gazette_ and specifying the name of the ship, the official number of the ship and the full name and address of the registered owner, state that, unless the Registrar is contacted within 30 days by the registered owner, by the registered agent (if any) or by another person having knowledge of the whereabouts of either the ship or of the registered owner or registered agent, the Registrar shall inform the Authority of the fact that a notice has been published under this subsection and that no such contact has been made.

             (4)  Where the Registrar informs the Authority that he or she has published a notice under subsection (3) and that he or she has not been contacted as required by that notice, the Authority may, by notice given to the Registrar, unless it has other information that leads it to believe that the ship may still be entitled to be registered, direct that the registration relating to the ship be closed and, upon receipt of such a notice by the Registrar, section 66 applies as if the ship had ceased to be entitled to be registered and the notice given by the Authority were a notice under subsection 66(1) stating that fact.

##### <a id="93"></a>93  Ships deemed to be registered to cease to be registered if not entitled to be registered

             (1)  At any time after the expiration of the period of 6 months commencing on the commencing date, the Registrar shall, if he or she has reason to suspect that a ship deemed to be registered on the commencing date was not, on that date, entitled to be registered, serve notice of that fact on the owner and mortgagee or mortgagees (if any) of the ship, drawing attention to the provisions of this section.

             (2)  If, within a period of 3 months commencing on the last day on which the notice was served, evidence to the satisfaction of the Registrar that the ship is entitled to be registered is not produced, the Registrar shall, on the expiration of that period, cause the registration of that ship to be closed.

                     (b)  where notice is to be served on 2 or more persons:

                              (i)  if notice is served on those persons on the same day—that day; or

                    <a name="mortgage"></a>**_mortgagee_** includes a mortgagee deemed to be registered by virtue of this Part.

##### <a id="94"></a>94  Registrar may defer registration etc.

             (3)  Where, in relation to a ship, any document has been produced for lodgment, or lodged, during the period referred to in subsection (1), and the Registrar has deferred the making of a record or entry in the Register, or the doing of any other thing, relating to the document during that period, then, for the purpose of making a record or entry in the Register, or doing any other thing, relating to the document after the expiration of that period:

                     (a)  in the case of a document produced for lodgment, if the Registrar considers that the document is in a form satisfactory for lodgment—the document shall be deemed to have been lodged on the date on which, and at the time when, it was so produced; and

                     (b)  in the case of a document lodged—the record or entry made in the Register, or the thing done, relating to the document shall be deemed to have been made or done on the date on which, and at the time when, it was lodged.
