                              (i)  the primary beneficiary dies within 10 years after the commencement day of the income stream; and

Determination that income stream not asset-test exempt

             (4)  The Secretary may determine that an income stream that meets the requirements of subsection (2) is not an asset-test exempt income stream if the Secretary is satisfied that the person who has purchased the income stream has commuted an asset-test exempt income stream within 6 months after its commencement day on at least 3 occasions since the person first received a social security payment.

Determination that income stream is asset-test exempt

             (5)  The Secretary may determine, in writing, that an income stream that does not meet the requirements of subsection (2) is an asset-test exempt income stream for the purposes of this Act.

Definitions

             (1)  In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

                    <a name="relev-awot"></a>**_relevant AWOTE_**, in relation to a calendar year, means the amount that, under the heading “Trend Estimates” in the document entitled “Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia” last published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics before 1 January in that year, is specified as being the full-time adult ordinary time earnings for Australia for the quarter to which the document relates.

                    <a name="season-work"></a>**_seasonal work_** means:

                     (a)  work that, because of its nature or of factors peculiar to the industry in which it is performed, is available, at approximately the same time or times every year, for part or parts only of the year; or

Secretary’s determination—seasonal work

             (2)  The Secretary may determine in writing that a specified kind of work that is intermittent is seasonal work for the purposes of this Act. The determination is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

Seasonal work preclusion periods

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person is not a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  the person has made a claim for newstart allowance, widow allowance, mature age allowance under Part 2.12B or youth allowance; and

                     (c)  the person was engaged in seasonal work at any time during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the person lodged the claim;

the person’s **_seasonal work preclusion period_** in relation to the claim is the period consisting of the number of weeks worked out under subsection (5) that starts on the day on which the claim was lodged.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a person is a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  the person has made a claim for newstart allowance, mature age allowance under Part 2.12B, partner allowance, parenting payment or youth allowance; and

                     (c)  the person, or the person’s partner, or both, were engaged in seasonal work at any time during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the person lodged the claim;

the person’s **_seasonal work preclusion period_** in relation to the claim is the period consisting of the number of weeks worked out under subsection (6), (7) or (8) that starts on the day on which the claim was lodged.

             (5)  If the person is not a member of a couple, the number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period is worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Identify each period of continuous seasonal work by the person that ended during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the claim was lodged. If the person has performed seasonal work during 2 periods that are less than 14 days apart, the periods of work and the intervening period are taken to be one continuous period during which the person has performed seasonal work.

_Step 2._ If a period identified in Step 1 has already been taken into account when working out a seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a previous claim by the person (whether for the same or a different allowance or payment), disregard the period. Each remaining period is called a **_relevant period of seasonal work_**.

_Step 3._ Work out the amount of seasonal work income earned by the person during each of the person’s relevant periods of seasonal work, disregarding any income by way of a lump sum that was earned during that period but was not paid to the person before the day on which the claim was lodged.

_Step 4._   Add together the amounts worked out in Step 3\. The result is called the person’s **_seasonal work earnings_**.

_Step 5._Divide the person’s seasonal work earnings by the amount of the relevant AWOTE for the calendar year in which the claim was lodged. The result is called the person’s **_AWOTE weeks_** and represents the number of weeks (including any part of a week) that a person paid at a rate equal to the relevant AWOTE for that calendar year would have to work to earn an amount equal to the person’s seasonal work earnings.

_Step 6._ Work out the number of weeks in the person’s relevant periods of seasonal work by dividing the total number of days included in those periods by 7\. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person’s **_seasonal work weeks_**.

_Step 6A._ If there is a period between one relevant period of seasonal work and another, or between a relevant period of seasonal work and the day on which the claim was lodged, work out the number of weeks in the period (the **_intervening period_**). This is done by dividing the total number of days in the intervening period by 7.

_Step 6B._ If there is more than one intervening period, add together the number of weeks worked out for each intervening period. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person’s **_intervening weeks_**.

_Step 6C_. Add together the number of seasonal work weeks worked out under Step 6 and the number of intervening weeks (if any) worked out under Step 6B. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person’s **_self-supported weeks_**.

_Step 7._   Subtract the person’s self-supported weeks from the person’s AWOTE weeks. The result (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number) is the **_number of weeks in the person’s_** **_seasonal work preclusion period_**. If the result is a negative number, the number of weeks in the period is taken to be nil.</div>

Note 1:       For **_relevant AWOTE_** see subsection (1).

Note 2:       For **_seasonal work_** see subsection (1).

Note 3:       For **_seasonal work income_** see subsection (1).

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the person is a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  the person was engaged in seasonal work at any time during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the person lodged the claim (the **_relevant period_**); and

                     (c)  the person’s partner was not engaged in seasonal work at any time during the relevant period; 

the number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period is worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Identify each period of continuous seasonal work by the person that ended during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the claim was lodged. If the person has performed seasonal work during 2 periods that are less than 14 days apart, the periods of work and the intervening period are taken to be one continuous period during which the person has performed seasonal work.

_Step 2._ If a period identified in Step 1 has already been taken into account when working out a seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a previous claim by the person (whether for the same or a different allowance or payment), disregard the period. Each remaining period is called a **_relevant period of seasonal work_**.

_Step 3._ Work out the amount of seasonal work income earned by the person during each of the person’s relevant periods of seasonal work, disregarding any income by way of a lump sum that was earned during that period but was not paid to the person before the day on which the claim was lodged.

_Step 4._   Add together the amounts worked out in Step 3\. The result is called the person’s **_seasonal work earnings_**.

_Step 5._   This step does not apply in the case of a person who has made a claim for parenting payment; in such a case, go directly to Step 6\. In any other case, work out the total amount of income from personal exertion earned by the person’s partner during the person’s relevant periods of seasonal work. Add the amount obtained to the person’s seasonal work earnings. The result is called the **_couple’s combined earnings_**.

_Step 6._ Divide:

               (a)     in the case of a person who has made a claim for parenting payment—the person’s seasonal work earnings; or

               (b)     in any other case—the couple’s combined earnings;

              by twice the amount of the relevant AWOTE for the calendar year in which the claim was lodged. The result is called the couple’s **_AWOTE weeks_** and represents the number of weeks (including any part of a week) that 2 persons, each paid at a rate equal to the relevant AWOTE for that calendar year, would have to work to earn together an amount equal to (if paragraph (a) applies) the person’s seasonal work earnings or (if paragraph (b) applies) the couple’s combined earnings.

_Step 7._ Work out the number of weeks in the person’s relevant periods of seasonal work by dividing the total number of days included in those periods by 7\. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person’s **_seasonal work weeks_**.

_Step 7A._ If there is a period between one relevant period of seasonal work and another, or between a relevant period of seasonal work and the day on which the claim was lodged, work out the number of weeks in the period (the **_intervening period_**). This is done by dividing the total number of days in the intervening period by 7.

_Step 7B._ If there is more than one intervening period, add together the number of weeks worked out for each intervening period. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person’s **_intervening weeks_**.

_Step 7C._ Add together the number of seasonal work weeks worked out under Step 7 and the number of intervening weeks (if any) worked out under Step 7B. The result (including any part of a week) is called the person’s **_self-supported weeks_**.

_Step 8._   Subtract the person’s self-supported weeks from the couple’s AWOTE weeks. The result (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number) is the **_number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period_**. If the result is a negative number, the number of weeks in the period is taken to be nil.</div>

Note 1:       For **_relevant AWOTE_** see subsection (1).

Note 2:       For **_seasonal work_** see subsection (1).

Note 3:       For **_seasonal work income_** see subsection (1).

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  the person is a member of a couple; and 

                     (b)  the person was not engaged in seasonal work at any time during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the person lodged the claim (the **_relevant period_**); and

                     (c)  the person’s partner was engaged in seasonal work at any time during the relevant period; 

the number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period is worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Identify each period of continuous seasonal work by the partner that ended during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the claim was lodged. If the partner has performed seasonal work during 2 periods that are less than 14 days apart, the periods of work and the intervening period are taken to be one continuous period during which the partner has performed seasonal work.

_Step 2._ If a period identified in Step 1 has already been taken into account when working out a seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a previous claim by the person (whether for the same or a different allowance or payment), disregard the period. Each remaining period is called a **_relevant period of seasonal work_**.

_Step 3._ Work out the total amount of income from personal exertion earned by the person during the partner’s relevant periods of seasonal work. The result is called the **_person’s earnings_**.

_Step 4._ Steps 4, 5 and 6 do not apply in the case of a person who has made a claim for parenting payment; in such a case, go directly to Step 7\. In any other case, work out the amount of seasonal work income earned by the partner during each of the partner’s relevant periods of seasonal work, disregarding any income by way of a lump sum that was earned during that period but was not paid to the partner before the day on which the claim was lodged.

_Step 5._   Add together the amounts worked out in Step 4\. The result is called the partner’s **_seasonal work earnings_**.

_Step 6._ Add the partner’s seasonal work earnings and the person’s earnings. The result is called the **_couple’s combined earnings_**.

_Step 7._ Divide:

               (a)     in the case of a person who has made a claim for parenting payment—the person’s earnings; or

               (b)     in any other case—the couple’s combined earnings;

              by twice the amount of the relevant AWOTE for the calendar year in which the claim was lodged. The result is called the couple’s **_AWOTE weeks_** and represents the number of weeks (including any part of a week) that 2 persons, each paid at a rate equal to the relevant AWOTE for that calendar year, would have to work to earn together an amount equal to (if paragraph (a) applies) the person’s earnings or (if paragraph (b) applies) the couple’s combined earnings.

_Step 8._ Work out the number of weeks in the partner’s relevant periods of seasonal work by dividing the total number of days included in those periods by 7\. The result (including any part of a week) is called the partner’s **_seasonal work weeks_**.

_Step 8A._ If there is a period between one relevant period of seasonal work and another, or between a relevant period of seasonal work and the day on which the claim was lodged, work out the number of weeks in the period (the **_intervening period_**). This is done by dividing the total number of days in the intervening period by 7.

_Step 8B._ If there is more than one intervening period, add together the number of weeks worked out for each intervening period. The result (including any part of a week) is called the partner’s **_intervening weeks_**.

_Step 8C._ Add together the number of seasonal work weeks worked out under Step 8 and the number of intervening weeks (if any) worked out under Step 8B. The result (including any part of a week) is called the partner’s **_self-supported weeks_**.

_Step 9._   Subtract the partner’s self-supported weeks from the couple’s AWOTE weeks. The result (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number) is the **_number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period_**. If the result is a negative number, the number of weeks in the period is taken to be nil.</div>

Note 1:       For **_relevant AWOTE_** see subsection (1).

Note 2:       For **_seasonal work_** see subsection (1).

Note 3:       For **_seasonal work income_** see subsection (1).

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  the person is a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  both the person and the person’s partner have engaged in seasonal work during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the claim was lodged;

the number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period is worked out as follows:

<div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 5pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 2cm; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0cm; PADDING-TOP: 5pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out what would be the number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period if subsection (6) applied to the person.

_Step 2._   Work out what would be the number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period if subsection (7) applied to the person.

_Step 3._ Compare the number of weeks in each period. The **_number of weeks in the person’s seasonal work preclusion period_** is equal to the number of weeks in the longer of the 2 periods.</div>

Subject to a seasonal work preclusion period

           (11)  If a person’s seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a claim consists of a number of weeks that is greater than nil, then, except as otherwise provided under this Act, the person is **_subject to that period_** for the purposes of this Act. 

Seasonal work non-benefit periods

           (12)  If:

                     (a)  a person is a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  the person has made a claim for parenting payment; and 

                     (c)  the person, or the person’s partner, or both, were engaged in seasonal work at any time during the 6 months immediately before the day on which the person lodged the claim;

the person’s **_seasonal work non-benefit period_** in relation to the claim is the period that would be the person’s seasonal work preclusion period in relation to a claim for newstart allowance, if the person had lodged such a claim on the day on which the claim for parenting payment was lodged and the claim for newstart allowance had been granted.

Subject to a seasonal work non-benefit period

           (13)  If a person’s seasonal work non-benefit period in relation to a claim consists of a number of weeks that is greater than nil, then, except as otherwise provided under this Act, the person is **_subject to that period_** for the purposes of this Act.

## 3  Subsection 19C(1)
