##### <a id="3"></a>3  Schedule(s)

                   Each Act that is specified in a Schedule to this Act is amended or repealed as set out in the applicable items in the Schedule concerned, and any other item in a Schedule to this Act has effect according to its terms.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Entitlements from 1 July 2008

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the **_lost payments_**) under an Act that is amended by Schedule 1, 2, 3 or 5 to this Act if the relevant Schedule had commenced on 1 July 2008; and

                     (b)  because the Schedule did not commence until after 1 July 2008, the person is not entitled to the payment or payments; and

                     (c)  the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the **_replacement payments_**) to compensate the person for the lost payments;

the Finance Minister must make a determination, in accordance with subsection (4), to fully compensate the person.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the **_lost payments_**) under the _Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991_ if the first amendment of the Trust Deed under that Act that is made after the commencement of this section had commenced on 1 July 2008; and

                     (b)  because that amendment did not commence until after 1 July 2008, the person is not entitled to the payment or payments; and

                     (c)  the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the **_replacement payments_**) to compensate the person for the lost payments;

the Finance Minister must make a determination, in accordance with subsection (4), to fully compensate the person.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the **_lost payments_**) under the _Superannuation Act 1990_ if the first amendment of the Trust Deed under that Act that is made after the commencement of this section had commenced on 1 July 2008; and

                     (b)  because that amendment did not commence until after 1 July 2008, the person is not entitled to the payment or payments; and

                     (c)  the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the **_replacement payments_**) to compensate the person for the lost payments;

             (5)  An application must be in writing in the form approved by the Finance Minister.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, a determination of the Finance Minister that a person is entitled to one or more replacement payments does not affect the entitlements of any other person under an Act amended by Schedule 1, 2, 3 or 5 to this Act, the _Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991_ or the _Superannuation Act 1990_.

             (7)  Replacement payments are to be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.

then:
