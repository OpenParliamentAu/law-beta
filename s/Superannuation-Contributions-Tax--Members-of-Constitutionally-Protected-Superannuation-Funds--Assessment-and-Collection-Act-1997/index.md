##### <a id="6"></a>6  Simplified outline of Act

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Act.

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(a)   If there are surchargeable

contributions for a member for the 1996-97 financial year or a later

financial year (being a financial year that ends before 1 July 2005), the Commissioner will calculate the member’s adjusted taxable income for the

financial year.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(b)   If the amount calculated is

greater than the surcharge threshold amount, the Commissioner will calculate

the rate of surcharge and the amount of the surcharge payable on the

period after 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996 are subject to surcharge.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(c)   For a defined benefits

superannuation scheme, the surcharge is payable on an amount calculated to be

the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the

administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member

for the financial year.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(d)   If, after the assessment of

surcharge, the member’s adjusted taxable income is found to be different from

the amount that was previously calculated or the surchargeable contributions

are found to be different from the amount on which the assessment was based,

the Commissioner may amend the assessment.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(e)   The member is liable to pay

the surcharge on the member’s surchargeable contributions for a financial year,

but the surcharge is not payable before benefits become payable.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt;page-break-after:avoid">(f)   If

liability for surcharge is increased as a result of an amendment of an

assessment, interest is payable on the additional surcharge.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(g)   A member may object against

an assessment of surcharge in the way set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ for objecting against assessments of income tax.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">(h)   A late payment penalty

applies if surcharge is not paid on time.</li>

No surcharge is payable by residents of external Territories

             (3)  Surcharge is not payable for a financial year if the person who would be liable to pay the surcharge is a Territory resident for the purposes of Division 1A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act as it applies to the year of income that comprises that financial year.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Surchargeable contributions

Application

             (1)  This section explains what are the surchargeable contributions of a member for a financial year and how they are to be worked out.

Member other than a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  there are any contributed amounts for a financial year in relation to a member other than a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme; and

                     (b)  the constitutionally protected superannuation fund is a complying superannuation fund for the purposes of the year of income comprising the financial year;

the **_surchargeable contributions_** of the member for the financial year are the sum of:

                     (c)  so much of the amounts referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of **_contributed amounts_** in section 38 as:

                              (i)  are taxable contributions under subparagraph 274(1)(a)(i), (b)(ii), (ba)(i) or (ba)(iv) or paragraph 274(1)(d) or (e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act; or

                             (ii)  are allowed as deductions to the member under section 82AAT of that Act; or

                            (iii)  subject to subsection (3), constitute amounts accrued after 20 August 1996 that are eligible termination payments under paragraph (a) of the definition of **_eligible termination payment_** in subsection 27A(1) of that Act and are rolled-over on or after 1 July 1997; and

                     (d)  any amounts referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) or (iii) of the definition of **_contributed amount_** in section 38.

             (3)  If an eligible termination payment within the meaning of subparagraph (2)(c)(iii) has been made or is made to or for a taxpayer after 20 August 1996, surcharge is payable only on the part of the reduced amount of the eligible termination payment that is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00110/Html/SupContTaxMembConstProtSupFundsAssColl1997_WD02_image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name="post-20-august-1996-period"></a>**_post-20 August 1996 period_** means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made that occurred after 20 August 1996.

                    <a name="ruced-amount"></a>**_reduced amount_** of an eligible termination payment is the amount remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment any post-June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.

                    <a name="total-period"></a>**_total period_** means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made.

Member of defined benefits superannuation scheme

             (4)  The **_surchargeable contributions_** for a financial year of a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme are the amounts that constitute the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.

Value of benefits and expenses—financial year earlier than 1999-2000 financial year

             (5)  The **_actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of,_** a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme for the 1996-97 financial year or for either of the next 2 financial years is the amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00110/Html/SupContTaxMembConstProtSupFundsAssColl1997_WD02_image003.gif)

where:

                    <a name="annual-salari"></a>**_annual salary_** means:

                     (a)  if paragraph (b) does not apply—the amount that is the member’s annual salary for the financial year; or

                     (b)  if another amount is taken to be the member’s annual salary for the purposes of the scheme as it applies to the member for the financial year—that other amount.

                    <a name="notion-surcharg-contribut-factor"></a>**_notional surchargeable contributions factor_** means the factor applying to the member for the financial year worked out by an eligible actuary in accordance with:

                     (a)  the method set out in Superannuation Contributions Ruling SCR 97/1; or

                     (b)  if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_—the method so approved.

Value of benefits and expenses—1999-2000 financial year or a later financial year

             (6)  The **_actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of,_** a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme for the 1999-2000 financial year or a later financial year is an amount worked out using:

                     (a)  the method set out in the regulations, being a method that excludes Government co-contributions made under the _Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003_ and contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes Government co-contributions made under the _Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003_ and contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_—the method so approved.

Regulations

             (7)  Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (6)(a) may specify, or make provision for the Commissioner to specify in writing, different methods in relation to different superannuation schemes, different classes of superannuation schemes or different classes of members of a superannuation scheme.

Transitional provision for 1996-97 financial year

             (8)  For the 1996-97 financial year, a member’s surchargeable contributions are to be worked out only for the part of that financial year that started immediately after 7.30 pm by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory on 20 August 1996.

Reduced surchargeable contributions

             (9)  The amount of the **_surchargeable contributions_** of a member for a financial year is the amount worked out under subsection (2) or (4) (as appropriate), reduced by the amount worked out under subsection (10), if:

                     (a)  an eligible termination payment is made to the member in the financial year from the constitutionally protected superannuation fund; and

                     (b)  the eligible termination payment has an excessive component.

           (10)  The amount of the reduction is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Amount of the reduction_

_Step 1._   Work out the amount that would have been the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 83 component of the eligible termination payment if the amount of the excessive component of the eligible termination payment had been nil.

_Step 2._   Work out the taxed element of the retained amount of the post-June 83 component of the eligible termination payment.

_Step 3._   Subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 1.

_Step 4._   Divide the result of step 3 by 0.85.

_Step 5._   Subtract the result of step 3 from the result of step 4.

_Step 6._   Add the result of step 5 to the excessive component of the eligible termination payment.

_Step 7._   Identify the amount of the surchargeable contributions (apart from subsection (9)) of the member reported for the financial year by the entity that paid the eligible termination payment.

_Step 8._   Identify the lesser of the results of steps 6 and 7 (or either result if they are the same).

             (4)  The **_indexation factor_** for a financial year is the number, calculated to 3 decimal places, using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00110/Html/SupContTaxMembConstProtSupFundsAssColl1997_WD02_image005.gif)

where:

                    <a name="previou-march-year"></a>**_previous March year_** means the period of 12 months immediately before the current March year.

Rounding up of indexation factor

             (5)  If the number calculated under subsection (4) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.001.

Change in index numbers

             (6)  If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  When surcharge will become payable

Explanation of section

             (1)  This section makes provision for the deferment of the liability of a member of a constitutionally protected superannuation fund to pay surcharge, and for interest to accrue on the deferred amount.

Accounts to be kept

             (2)  The Commissioner is to keep a surcharge debt account for each member of a constitutionally protected superannuation fund.

Account to be debited for surcharge

             (3)  The Commissioner is to debit the account for surcharge assessed to be payable on the member’s surchargeable contributions.

Interest to be debited

             (4)  If the member’s account is in debit at the end of a financial year, the Commissioner is to debit the account for interest on the amount by which the account is in debit, calculated at the Treasury bond rate for the last day of the financial year for bonds with a 10 year term.

Rate of interest

             (5)  The **_Treasury bond rate_** for the last day of a financial year for bonds with a 10 year term is:

                     (a)  if any Treasury bonds with that term were issued on that day—the annual yield on those bonds; or

                     (b)  otherwise—the annual yield on Treasury bonds with that term, as published by the Reserve Bank of Australia for that day.

Payment to be made when benefit becomes payable

             (6)  Subject to subsection (6AA), when a superannuation benefit (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) becomes payable by a superannuation provider for the benefit of a member whose surcharge debt account is in debit, the member is liable to pay to the Commissioner the lesser of:

                     (a)  the amount by which the account is in debit; or

                     (b)  the total of the following amounts:

                              (i)  15% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued between 20 August 1996 and 1 July 2003;

                             (ii)  14.5% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued in the 2003-2004 financial year;

                            (iii)  12.5% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued in the 2004-2005 financial year.

       (6AA)  If:

                     (a)  a payment split applies to a splittable payment in respect of an interest that a person has as a member; and

                     (b)  the splittable payment becomes payable in circumstances where the member’s surcharge account is in debit;

then the member is liable to pay to the Commissioner the lesser of:

                     (c)  the amount by which the account is in debit; and

                     (d)  the total of the following amounts:

                             (ii)  14.5% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits that would have been payable to the member but for the payment split and that accrued in the 2003-2004 financial year;

                            (iii)  12.5% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits that would have been payable to the member but for the payment split and that accrued in the 2004-2005 financial year.

Payment to be made if fund ceases to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund

          (6A)  If a superannuation fund ceases to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund at a time when a member’s surcharge debt account is in debit, the member is liable to pay to the Commissioner the lesser of:

                     (a)  the amount by which the account is in debit; or

                     (b)  the total of the following amounts:

                              (i)  15% of the employer-financed component of any part of the value of the age retirement benefits of the member when the fund ceased to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund that accrued between 20 August 1996 and 1 July 2003;

                             (ii)  14.5% of the employer-financed component of any part of the value of the age retirement benefits of the member when the fund ceased to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund that accrued in the 2003-2004 financial year;

                            (iii)  12.5% of the employer-financed component of any part of the value of the age retirement benefits of the member when the fund ceased to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund that accrued in the 2004-2005 financial year.

             (7)  If a member becomes liable to pay an amount to the Commissioner under subsection (6), (6AA) or (6A), the Commissioner must give the member a notice stating that the member is liable to pay the amount. The notice must contain the date on which it is issued.

             (8)  The amount is payable within 3 months after the date of issue of the notice and the notice is to state that the amount is so payable. Payment of the amount results in a nil balance in the account.

Note:          For provisions about collection and recovery of superannuation contributions surcharge and other related amounts, see Part 4-15 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

                     (b)  a superannuation benefit (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) is not payable by the superannuation provider for the benefit of the person because the person has become:

                     (c)  notify the member of the revised balance of the surcharge debt account.

General provision

             (1)  The Commissioner may, subject to this section, at any time amend an assessment of surcharge on a member’s surchargeable contributions by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner thinks necessary, even though surcharge has been paid in respect of the assessment. Such an amendment may be made on the Commissioner’s own initiative or at the request of the member.

Period for making further amendment

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an assessment has been amended in any particular in a way that effected a reduction in the amount of surcharge payable; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of making the amendment, the Commissioner accepted a statement made by or on behalf of a member;

             (3)  Subject to this section, if there has been an avoidance of surcharge, the Commissioner may:

                     (a)  if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the avoidance of surcharge is due to fraud or evasion—at any time; or

                     (b)  in any other case—within 4 years from the date upon which the surcharge became due and payable under the assessment;

amend the assessment by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner thinks necessary to correct the assessment.

Period where amendment reduces surcharge

the Commissioner may, before the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection, apply to the Federal Court for an order extending, or request the member to consent to the extension of, the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b).

Court may extend period

             (6)  If, on application made to the Federal Court of Australia in accordance with subsection (5), the Court is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable, or it was inappropriate, for the Commissioner to complete the examination within the period referred to in paragraph (5)(b) because of any action taken by the member or any failure of the member to take action that it would have been reasonable for the member to take, the Court may make an order extending the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b) for such period as the Court considers appropriate.

Member or provider may extend period

             (7)  If a request is made to the member in accordance with subsection (5), the member may, by writing, consent to the extension of the period within which the Commissioner may amend the assessment under paragraph (3)(b) for such period as is specified in the instrument of consent.

                     (d)  after the assessment was made:

                     (a)  under an assessment of surcharge on a member’s surchargeable contributions for a financial year, the rate of surcharge that applies to the member on particular surchargeable contributions for the financial year was assessed to be nil because paragraph 5(4)(e) of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Imposition Act 1997_ applied to the member; and

_Superannuation Contributions and Termination Payments Taxes Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (No. 131, 1999)_

## Schedule 2  

## 25  Transitional—superannuation providers to give corrective statements

If a superannuation provider has, before the commencement of this item, given a statement to the Commissioner under section 12 of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_ that did not comply with the requirements that would have applied if the amendments made by items of this Schedule that are taken to have commenced on 5 June 1997 had been in force, the provider must give to the Commissioner not later than a date fixed by the Minister by notice published in the _Gazette_, in substitution for the first-mentioned statement, a further statement that complies with those requirements.

If a notice of assessment was given to a member before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent:

                     (a)  if the member did not object against the assessment before that day, then, for the purpose of calculating under section 14ZW of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ the period within which the member may object against the assessment, the notice is taken to have been served on that day; and

                     (b)  if the member objected against the assessment before the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent, the member may make a further objection against the assessment and, for the purpose of calculating under section 14ZW of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ the period within which the member may make the further objection against the assessment, the notice is taken to have been served on that day.

## 27  Transitional—amendments of assessments

Nothing in section 15A of the _Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997_ prevents the amendment of an assessment for the purpose of giving effect:

                     (a)  to any amendment made by this Schedule or to item 25 or 26; or

                     (b)  to anything done under a provision of that Act as amended by this Schedule or under item 25 or 26.

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998-99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998-99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998-99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997-98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
