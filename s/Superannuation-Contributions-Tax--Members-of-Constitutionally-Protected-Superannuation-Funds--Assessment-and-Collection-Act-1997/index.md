An Act relating to the assessment and collection of superannuation contributions tax on members of constitutionally protected superannuation funds, and for related purposes
Part 1—Preliminary
  
1  Short title [see Note 1]
		This Act may be cited as the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Act 1997.
2  Commencement [see Note 1]
		This Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.
3  Act to bind Crown
	(1)	This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, of each of the States, of the Australian Capital Territory, of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island.
	(2)	Nothing in this Act permits the Crown to be prosecuted for an offence.
4  Extension to Norfolk Island
		This Act extends to Norfolk Island.
5  Object of Act
		The object of this Act is to provide for the assessment and collection of the superannuation contributions surcharge payable on surchargeable contributions for high‑income members of constitutionally protected superannuation funds.
6  Simplified outline of Act
		The following is a simplified outline of this Act.
(a)	If there are surchargeable contributions for a member for the 1996‑97 financial year or a later financial year, the Commissioner will calculate the member’s adjusted taxable income for the financial year.
(b)	If the amount calculated is greater than the surcharge threshold amount, the Commissioner will calculate the rate of surcharge and the amount of the surcharge payable on the surchargeable contributions. Only surchargeable contributions calculated for a period after 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996 are subject to surcharge.
(c)	For a defined benefits superannuation scheme, the surcharge is payable on an amount calculated to be the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.
(d)	If, after the assessment of surcharge, the member’s adjusted taxable income is found to be different from the amount that was previously calculated or the surchargeable contributions are found to be different from the amount on which the assessment was based, the Commissioner may amend the assessment.
(e)	The member is liable to pay the surcharge on the member’s surchargeable contributions for a financial year, but the surcharge is not payable before benefits become payable.
(f)	If liability for surcharge is increased as a result of an amendment of an assessment, interest is payable on the additional surcharge.
(g)	A member may object against an assessment of surcharge in the way set out in Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 for objecting against assessments of income tax.
(h)	A late payment penalty applies if surcharge is not paid on time.
7  Exclusion of certain members
		This Act does not apply to a person who is a member because he or she is a judge of a court of a State at the commencement of this Act.

Part 2—Liability to surcharge
  
8  Superannuation contributions surcharge
Financial years to which surcharge applies
	(1)	Superannuation contributions surcharge is payable on a member’s surchargeable contributions for the financial year that began on 1 July 1996 or a later financial year.
No surcharge is payable unless adjusted taxable income is greater than surcharge threshold
	(2)	Surcharge is not payable for a financial year unless the member’s adjusted taxable income for the financial year is greater than the surcharge threshold for the financial year.
No surcharge is payable by residents of external Territories
	(3)	Surcharge is not payable for a financial year if the person who would be liable to pay the surcharge is a Territory resident for the purposes of Division 1A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act as it applies to the year of income that comprises that financial year.
9  Surchargeable contributions
Application
	(1)	This section explains what are the surchargeable contributions of a member for a financial year and how they are to be worked out.
Member other than a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme
	(2)	If:
	(a)	there are any contributed amounts for a financial year in relation to a member other than a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme; and
	(b)	the constitutionally protected superannuation fund is a complying superannuation fund for the purposes of the year of income comprising the financial year;
the surchargeable contributions of the member for the financial year are the sum of:
	(c)	so much of the amounts referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) of the definition of contributed amounts in section 38 as:
	(i)	are taxable contributions under subparagraph 274(1)(a)(i), (b)(ii), (ba)(i) or (ba)(iv) or paragraph 274(1)(d) or (e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act; or
	(ii)	are allowed as deductions to the member under section 82AAT of that Act; or
	(iii)	subject to subsection (3), constitute amounts accrued after 20 August 1996 that are eligible termination payments under paragraph (a) of the definition of eligible termination payment in subsection 27A(1) of that Act and are rolled‑over on or after 1 July 1997; and
	(d)	any amounts referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) or (iii) of the definition of contributed amount in section 38.
	(3)	If an eligible termination payment within the meaning of subparagraph (2)(c)(iii) has been made or is made to or for a taxpayer after 20 August 1996, surcharge is payable only on the part of the reduced amount of the eligible termination payment that is worked out using the formula:

where:
post‑20 August 1996 period means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made that occurred after 20 August 1996.
reduced amount of an eligible termination payment is the amount remaining after deducting from the amount of the payment any post‑June 1994 invalidity component or CGT exempt component of the payment or any part of the payment that was made from an employee share acquisition scheme.
total period means the number of days in the period of the taxpayer’s employment for which the eligible termination payment was made.
Member of defined benefits superannuation scheme
	(4)	The surchargeable contributions for a financial year of a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme are the amounts that constitute the actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, the member for the financial year.
Value of benefits and expenses—financial year earlier than 1999‑2000 financial year
	(5)	The actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme for the 1996‑97 financial year or for either of the next 2 financial years is the amount worked out using the formula:

where:
annual salary means:
	(a)	if paragraph (b) does not apply—the amount that is the member’s annual salary for the financial year; or
	(b)	if another amount is taken to be the member’s annual salary for the purposes of the scheme as it applies to the member for the financial year—that other amount.
notional surchargeable contributions factor means the factor applying to the member for the financial year worked out by an eligible actuary in accordance with:
	(a)	the method set out in Superannuation Contributions Ruling SCR 97/1; or
	(b)	if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—the method so approved.
Value of benefits and expenses—1999‑2000 financial year or a later financial year
	(6)	The actuarial value of the benefits that accrued to, and the value of the administration expenses and risk benefits provided in respect of, a member of a defined benefits superannuation scheme for the 1999‑2000 financial year or a later financial year is an amount worked out using:
	(a)	the method set out in the regulations, being a method that excludes contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or
	(b)	if the Commissioner approves in writing another method as being appropriate in relation to the member for the financial year, being a method that excludes contributions made by the member for which the member is not entitled to an income tax deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act or under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—the method so approved.
Regulations
	(7)	Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (6)(a) may specify, or make provision for the Commissioner to specify in writing, different methods in relation to different superannuation schemes, different classes of superannuation schemes or different classes of members of a superannuation scheme.
Transitional provision for 1996‑97 financial year
	(8)	For the 1996‑97 financial year, a member’s surchargeable contributions are to be worked out only for the part of that financial year that started immediately after 7.30 pm by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory on 20 August 1996.
10  Surcharge threshold
Surcharge threshold for 1996‑97 financial year
	(1)	The surcharge threshold for the 1996‑97 financial year is $70,000.
Surcharge threshold for later financial year
	(2)	The surcharge threshold for a later financial year is the amount calculated using the formula:

where:
previous surcharge threshold means the surcharge threshold for the financial year immediately before the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.
indexation factor means the number calculated under subsections (4) and (5) for the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.
Rounding off of amount of surcharge threshold
	(3)	If an amount worked out for the purposes of subsection (2) is an amount of dollars and cents:
	(a)	if the number of cents is less than 50—the amount is to be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar; or
	(b)	otherwise—the amount is to be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.
Indexation factor
	(4)	The indexation factor for a financial year is the number, calculated to 3 decimal places, using the formula:

where:
index number, for a quarter, means the estimate of full‑time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings for the middle month of the quarter published by the Australian Statistician.
current March year means the period of 12 months ending on 31 March immediately before the financial year for which the surcharge threshold is being calculated.
previous March year means the period of 12 months immediately before the current March year.
Rounding up of indexation factor
	(5)	If the number calculated under subsection (4) for a financial year would, if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, end with a number greater than 4, the number so calculated is increased by 0.001.
Change in index numbers
	(6)	If at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the Australian Statistician has published or publishes an index number for a quarter in substitution for an index number previously published for the quarter, the publication of the later index number is to be disregarded.
Surcharge threshold to be published
	(7)	The Commissioner must publish before, or as soon as practicable after, the start of the 1997‑98 financial year, and before the start of each later financial year, the surcharge threshold for the financial year.
Note:	For the purposes of this section, Australian Statistician means the Australian Statistician referred to in subsection 5(2) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975.
11  Member liable to pay surcharge
	(1)	The superannuation contributions surcharge on a member’s surchargeable contributions for a financial year is payable by the member.
No surcharge payable if member dies
	(2)	However, surcharge is not payable on surchargeable contributions for a member for a financial year in which the member dies or a later financial year.

Accounts to be kept
	(2)	The Commissioner is to keep a surcharge debt account for each member of a constitutionally protected superannuation fund.
Account to be debited for surcharge
	(3)	The Commissioner is to debit the account for surcharge assessed to be payable on the member’s surchargeable contributions.
Interest to be debited
	(4)	If the member’s account is in debit at the end of a financial year, the Commissioner is to debit the account for interest on the amount by which the account is in debit, calculated at the Treasury bond rate for the last day of the financial year for bonds with a 10 year term.
Rate of interest
	(5)	The Treasury bond rate for the last day of a financial year for bonds with a 10 year term is:
	(a)	if any Treasury bonds with that term were issued on that day—the annual yield on those bonds; or

	(6AA)	If:
	(a)	a payment split applies to a splittable payment in respect of an interest that a person has as a member; and
	(b)	the splittable payment becomes payable in circumstances where the member’s surcharge account is in debit;
then the member is liable to pay to the Commissioner the lesser of:
	(c)	the amount by which the account is in debit; and
	(d)	15% of the employer‑financed component of that part of the benefits that would have been payable to the member but for the payment split and that accrued after 20 August 1996.
Payment to be made if fund ceases to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund
	(6A)	If a superannuation fund ceases to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund at a time when a member’s surcharge debt account is in debit, the member is liable to pay to the Commissioner the lesser of:
	(a)	the amount by which the account is in debit; or
	(b)	15% of the employer‑financed component of that part of the value of the age retirement benefits of the member at the time when the fund ceased to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund that accrued after 20 August 1996.
	(7)	If a member becomes liable to pay an amount to the Commissioner under subsection (6), (6AA) or (6A), the Commissioner must give the member a notice stating that the member is liable to pay the amount. The notice must contain the date on which it is issued.
	(8)	The amount is payable within 3 months after the date of issue of the notice and the notice is to state that the amount is so payable. Payment of the amount results in a nil balance in the account.
Note:	For provisions about collection and recovery of superannuation contributions surcharge and other related amounts, see Part 4‑15 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.
Person may direct superannuation provider to pay amount to Commissioner
	(8A)	If:
	(a)	a person is liable to pay an amount to the Commissioner under subsection (6) or (6AA); and

	(ii)	a member of an approved deposit fund; or
	(iii)	the holder of an RSA; or
	(iv)	the purchaser of an annuity from a life assurance company or from a registered organisation;

General provision
	(1)	The Commissioner may, subject to this section, at any time amend an assessment of surcharge on a member’s surchargeable contributions by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner thinks necessary, even though surcharge has been paid in respect of the assessment. Such an amendment may be made on the Commissioner’s own initiative or at the request of the member.
Period for making further amendment
	(2)	If:
	(a)	an assessment has been amended in any particular in a way that effected a reduction in the amount of surcharge payable; and

Period where avoidance of surcharge
	(3)	Subject to this section, if there has been an avoidance of surcharge, the Commissioner may:
