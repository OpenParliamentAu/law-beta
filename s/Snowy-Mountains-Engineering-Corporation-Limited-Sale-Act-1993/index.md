## Part 4—Transitional and saving provisions

### Division 1—Transitional and saving provisions in relation to long service leave

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Interpretation

             (1)  Unless the contrary intention appears, expressions used in this Division that are also used in the Long Service Leave Act have the same respective meanings as in that Act.

             (2)  In this Division:

                    <a name="combin-servic-period"></a>**_combined service period_**, in relation to an employee, means the total of:

                     (a)  the period that is, immediately before the sale day, the employee’s period of service for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act; and

                     (b)  the period starting on the sale day during which the employee continues to be an employee of SMEC.

                    <a name="employe"></a>**_employee_** includes a person employed in a full-time or a part-time capacity.

                    <a name="law"></a>**_law_** means:

                     (a)  a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or

                     (b)  regulations or any other instrument (other than an award, determination or industrial agreement) made under such a law.

                    <a name="post-sale-long-servic-leav-right"></a>**_post-sale long service leave rights_**, in relation to an employee, means any long service leave rights an employee acquires under an award, determination, industrial agreement or law (other than this Act) on or after the sale day.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Long service leave for employees with less than 10 years service

             (1)  This section provides that, in certain circumstances, SMEC may grant long service leave to an employee whose period of service for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act was less than 10 years.

             (2)  This section applies in relation to a person who was an employee of SMEC immediately before the sale day if, at that time, the employee’s period of service for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act was less than 10 years.

             (3)  This section does not apply in relation to an employee who stops being an employee of SMEC by dying. Section 12 covers those employees.

             (4)  If, from and after the sale day, the employee continues to be employed by SMEC until his or her combined service period is at least 10 years, SMEC may grant the employee long service leave on full salary for a period up to the employee’s long service leave credit under subsection 13(1).

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the employee is to stop being an employee of SMEC on or after reaching the minimum retiring age, or because of retrenchment; and

                     (b)  the employee’s combined service period at the time when he or she is to stop being an employee of SMEC is at least one year;

SMEC may grant the employee long service leave on full salary for a period up to the employee’s long service leave credit under subsection 13(1).

             (6)  If a period of long service leave may be granted to an employee under subsection (4) or (5), SMEC may, if the employee asks in writing, grant the employee long service leave on half salary for a period not exceeding twice that first-mentioned period.

             (7)  Long service leave granted in the circumstances set out in subsection (5) is to be taken so as to end immediately before the employee stops being an employee.

             (8)  For the purposes of this section, the rate of salary to be used in working out the full salary of an employee is the rate that would be applicable to the employee under section 20 of the Long Service Leave Act if:

                     (a)  that section applied to the employee; and

                     (b)  for the expression “section 16 or 17” in that section there were substituted the expression “section 10 of the _Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited_<st1:city style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">_Sale_</st1:place></st1:city>_Act 1993_”.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Payments in lieu of long service leave for employees with less than 10 years service

             (1)  This section provides that, in certain circumstances, SMEC must pay an amount in respect of long service leave to an employee who has not used all of his or her long service leave credit by taking long service leave under section 10.

             (2)  This section applies in relation to a person who was an employee of SMEC immediately before the sale day if, at that time, the employee’s period of service for the purposes of the Long Service Leave Act was less than 10 years.

             (3)  This section does not apply in relation to an employee who stops being an employee of SMEC by dying. Section 12 covers those employees.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (7), if the employee stops being an employee of SMEC on or after the day on which his or her combined service period reache<st1:personname style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">s 1</st1:personname>0 years, SMEC must pay him or her an amount equal to full salary in respect of his or her long service leave credit under subsection 13(2).

             (5)  Subject to subsection (7), if:

                     (a)  the employee stops being an employee of SMEC, on or after reaching the minimum retiring age, or because of retrenchment; and

                     (b)  at that time, the employee’s combined service period is at least one year;

SMEC must pay him or her an amount equal to full salary in respect of his or her long service leave credit under subsection 13(2).

             (6)  Subject to subsection (7), if:

                     (a)  the employee stops being an employee of SMEC; and

                     (b)  SMEC is satisfied that the employee left SMEC because of ill health that justified his or her so leaving; and

                     (c)  when the employee left, his or her combined service period was at least one year;

SMEC must pay him or her an amount equal to full salary in respect of his or her long service leave credit under subsection 13(2).

             (7)  An employee may, by written notice given to SMEC before the employee stops being an employee of SMEC:

                     (a)  ask SMEC not to make a payment to the employee under this section; or
