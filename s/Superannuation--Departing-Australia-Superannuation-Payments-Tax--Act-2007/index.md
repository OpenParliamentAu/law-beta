##### <a id="4"></a>4  Imposition of tax

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Amount of tax

             (1)  The amount of the tax is as follows:

                     (a)  for the tax free component of the departing Australia superannuation payment—nil;

                     (b)  for the element taxed in the fund of the taxable component of the departing Australia superannuation payment—35%;

                     (c)  for the element untaxed in the fund of the taxable component of the departing Australia superannuation payment—45%.

             (2)  However, if the departing Australia superannuation payment is a roll‑over superannuation benefit paid under section 20H of the _Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999_, the amount of the tax for the element untaxed in the fund of the taxable component of the payment is:

                     (a)  for the amount (if any) of the element that is not an excess untaxed roll‑over amount—45%; and

                     (b)  for the amount (if any) of the element that is an excess untaxed roll‑over amount—nil.

Note:          The tax for the excess untaxed roll‑over amount is set at nil to avoid double taxation of that amount, which is also subject to tax under the _Superannuation (Excess Untaxed Roll‑over Amounts Tax) Act 2007_.
