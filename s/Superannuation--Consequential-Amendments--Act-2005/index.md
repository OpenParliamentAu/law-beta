## 3  CGT roll-over—transfer of PSS Fund assets to pooled superannuation trust

Object

(1)        The object of this item is to provide for a CGT roll-over so as to facilitate the exercise by the Board of its powers under:

                     (a)  section 22 of the _Superannuation Act 1990_ in relation to the PSS Fund; and

                     (b)  section 20 of the _Superannuation Act 2005_ in relation to the PSSAP Fund;

to set up and/or operate a pooled superannuation trust that is used for investing the assets of the PSS Fund and the assets of the PSSAP Fund.

Roll-over

(2)        There is a roll-over if:

                     (a)  one or more CGT events happen because the Board ceases to hold all of the CGT assets of the PSS Fund; and

                     (b)  because of the cessation, CGT assets (the **_identical assets_**) that, together, are identical to all the CGT assets of the PSS Fund just before the happening of the CGT events start to be held by the trustee (the **_transferee trustee_**) of a pooled superannuation trust (whether or not all the identical assets were assets of the PSS Fund just before the CGT events); and

                     (c)  the cessation is part of a scheme under which CGT assets of the PSS Fund are replaced with units in the pooled superannuation trust.

_Note:       The transferee trustee may be the Board—see subsection 960-100(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

(3)        A capital gain or capital loss the Board makes from each of the CGT events is disregarded.

(4)        For the transferee trustee, the first element of the cost base of each of the identical assets the transferee trustee holds is the cost base of the corresponding asset for the Board at the time of the relevant CGT event.

(5)        For the transferee trustee, the first element of the reduced cost base of each of the identical assets the transferee trustee holds is the reduced cost base of the corresponding asset for the Board at the time of the relevant CGT event.

(6)        For the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, a roll-over covered by this item is taken to be a same-asset roll-over.

Interpretation

(7)        An expression used in this item and in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has the same meaning in this item as it has in that Act.

(8)        In this item:

**_Board_** has the same meaning as in the _Superannuation Act 1990_.
