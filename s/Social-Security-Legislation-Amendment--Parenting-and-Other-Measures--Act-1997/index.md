##### <a id="500A"></a>500A  Qualification for parenting payment—temporary absences from Australia

             (1)  Subject to subsection (3), for the purposes of paragraph 500(1)(c), a person satisfies the requirements of this section if the person:

                     (a)  is temporarily absent from Australia; and

                     (b)  has not been absent from Australia for more than 26 weeks.

             (3)  If:

                     (b)  when the claim was lodged, the claimant was unemployed;

the claimant is not qualified for parenting payment unless the Secretary is satisfied that the claimant’s unemployment is not due to the fact that the claimant is, or has been, engaged in industrial action or a series of industrial actions.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1) and without limiting that subsection, a claimant is taken not to be, or not to have been, engaged in industrial action or a series of industrial actions if the Secretary is satisfied that the claimant’s unemployment is due to the fact that other persons are, or have been, engaged in industrial action or in a series of industrial actions, and that:

                     (a)  if industrial action is still being engaged in:

                              (i)  those persons, or some of those persons, are members of a trade union that is involved in the industrial action, or have been such members at any time since industrial action started; and

                             (ii)  the claimant was not a member of that trade union at any time while industrial action was being engaged in.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not prevent a person from being qualified for parenting payment on a PP (partnered) payday that occurs after the relevant industrial action or series of industrial actions has stopped.

Note:          For **_industrial action_**, **_trade union_** and **_unemployment_** see section 16 and for **_PP (partnered) payday_** see section 18.

                            (iv)  if the adult has ever been a member of a couple—the child was being maintained by the adult immediately before the adult ceased to be a member of the couple; or

                             (v)  the child has been wholly or substantially in the care of the adult for a period of at least 12 months immediately before the day on which the adult claims parenting payment and is, in the Secretary’s opinion, likely to remain wholly or substantially in the adult’s care permanently or indefinitely.

##### <a id="500U"></a>500U  Multiple entitlement exclusion—person ceases to be member of a couple

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person is receiving a non-benefit PP (partnered); and

                     (b)  the person is also receiving a social security pension other than:

                              (i)  a wife pension; or

                             (ii)  a carer payment for caring for the person’s partner; or

                            (iii)  a mature age partner allowance; and

                     (c)  the person ceases to be a member of a couple;

parenting payment is not payable to the person.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person is receiving a non-benefit PP (partnered); and

                     (b)  the person is also receiving:

                              (i)  a wife pension; or

                             (ii)  a mature age partner allowance; and

                     (c)  the person’s partner dies;

parenting payment is not payable to the person.

                     (a)  a person is receiving a non-benefit PP (partnered); and

                     (b)  the person is also receiving a carer payment for caring for the person’s partner; and

                     (c)  the person’s partner dies; and

                     (d)  the person is qualified for payments under Subdivision B of Division 9 of Part 2.5;

parenting payment is not payable to the person.

Note 1:       For **_non-benefit PP (partnered)_** see section 18.

Note 2:       A person who is a member of a couple may receive both a social security pension and a non-benefit PP (partnered). If the person were to cease to be a member of a couple, the rate of parenting payment would be changed to the pension PP (single) rate. The person’s other social security pension would then cease to be payable due to the pension multiple entitlement exclusion provisions (see for example the combined effect of subsection 103(2) and section 136). Section 500U operates to stop the payment of parenting payment in the situations specified in subsections 500U(1), (2) and (3). As a result, the person’s other pension continues to be payable.

                   If subsection 500U(1) applies to a person, parenting payment stops being payable and the person continues to receive a pension referred to in paragraph 500U(1)(b) (eg. disability support pension) (the rate of that pension will be reassessed at the single rate). If the person would prefer to receive pension PP (single), the person could lodge a claim for parenting payment, which, if granted, would result in the person’s current pension ceasing to be payable. 

                   If subsections 500U(2) or (3) apply to a person, parenting payment stops being payable and the person continues to receive wife pension or mature age partner allowance or carer payment for caring for the person’s partner during the 14 week bereavement period. Parenting payment at the pension PP (single) rate may become payable immediately after the end of the bereavement period. A claim for parenting payment would be required at the end of the bereavement period if the person is receiving mature age partner allowance, but would not be required if the person is receiving wife pension or carer payment. If the person would prefer to receive pension PP (single) during the bereavement period, the person could choose not to receive wife pension (see subsection 188(2)) or mature age partner allowance (see subsection 660XKJ(2)) or carer payment (see subsection 237(2)) during the bereavement period, and lodge a claim for parenting payment instead.

             (1)  This section applies to a person who is a member of a couple.

             (2)  Parenting payment is not payable to a person if:

                     (a)  a period of non-payment of newstart allowance has been applied to the person under paragraph 608(1)(j); or

                     (b)  an activity test breach rate reduction period or an administrative breach rate reduction period for newstart allowance has been applied to the person under section 644AA or 644B; or

* * *

**Lump Sum Calculator**

This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum:

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the amount that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner’s payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

               (a)     the deceased partner had not died; and

               (b)     if, immediately before the partner’s death, the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple—they were not such a couple.

                   Note:             For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8).

_Step 2._   Work out the amount that would have been payable to the deceased partner on the deceased partner’s payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday if:

               (a)     the deceased partner had not died; and

               (b)     if, immediately before the partner’s death, the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple—they were not such a couple.

                   Note:             For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8).

_Step 3._   Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

_Step 4._   Work out the amount of pension PP (single) that would, if section 514D did not apply, have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner’s payday immediately before the first available bereavement adjustment payday: the result is called the **_surviving partner’s individual rate_**.

_Step 5._   Take the surviving partner’s individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_deceased partner’s instalment component_**.

_Step 6._   Work out the number of the deceased partner’s paydays in the bereavement lump sum period.

_Step 7._   Multiply the deceased partner’s instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable to the surviving partner under this section.

##### <a id="514E"></a>514E  Effect of death of surviving partner

                   If:

                     (a)  a surviving partner is qualified for payments under this Subdivision in relation to the death of the deceased partner; and

                     (b)  the surviving partner dies within the bereavement period; and

                     (c)  the Secretary does not become aware of the death of the deceased partner before the surviving partner dies;

there is payable, as a lump sum, to any person that the Secretary thinks appropriate, an amount worked out using the following Lump Sum Calculator:

* * *

**Lump Sum Calculator**

This is how to work out the amount of the lump sum:

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the amount that would have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner’s payday immediately after the day on which the surviving partner died if:

               (a)     neither the surviving partner nor the deceased partner had died; and

               (b)     if, immediately before the deceased partner’s death, the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple—they were not such a couple.

                   Note:             For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8).

_Step 2._   Work out the amount that would have been payable to the deceased partner on the deceased partner’s payday immediately after the day on which the surviving partner died if:

               (a)     neither the surviving partner nor the deceased partner had died; and

               (b)     if, immediately before the deceased partner’s death, the couple were an illness separated couple or a respite care couple—they were not such a couple.

                   Note:             For **_illness separated couple_** and **_respite care couple_** see subsections 4(7) and (8).

_Step 3._   Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2: the result is called the **_combined rate_**.

_Step 4._   Work out the amount of pension PP (single) that would, if section 514D did not apply, have been payable to the surviving partner on the surviving partner’s payday immediately after the day on which the surviving partner died if the surviving partner had not died: the result is called the **_surviving partner’s individual rate_**.

_Step 5._   Take the surviving partner’s individual rate away from the combined rate: the result is called the **_deceased partner’s instalment component_**.

_Step 6._   Work out the number of the deceased partner’s paydays in the period that commences on the day after the surviving partner dies and ends on the day on which the bereavement period ends.

_Step 7._   Multiply the deceased partner’s instalment component by the number obtained in Step 6: the result is the amount of the lump sum payable under this section.

  1068A-A1  The rate of pension PP (single) is an annual rate (fortnightly amounts are provided for information only).

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the person’s **_maximum basic rate_**using Module B below.

_Step 2._   Work out the amount per year (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using Module C below.

_Step 3._   Work out the amount per year (if any) for rent assistance using Module D below.

_Step 4._   Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 1, 2 and 3: the result is called the **_maximum_**_payment rate_.

_Step 5._   Apply the ordinary income test using Module E below to work out the income reduction.

_Step 6._   Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the _provisional payment rate_.

_Step 7._ The rate of pension PP (single) is the difference between:

               (a)     the provisional payment rate; and

               (b)     any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A);

              plus any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module F).

* * *

Note 1:       If a person’s rate is reduced under Step 6, the order in which the reduction is to be made against the components of the maximum payment rate is laid down by section 1207 (maximum basic rate first, then rent assistance, then pharmaceutical allowance).

Note 2:       In some circumstances a person may also be qualified for a pharmaceutical allowance under Part 2.22.

Note 3:       An amount of remote area allowance is to be added under Step 7 only if the person’s provisional payment rate under Step 6 is greater than nil.

#### Module B—Maximum basic rate

Maximum basic rate

  1068A-B1  A person’s maximum basic rate is $9,042.80 per year ($347.80 per fortnight).

Note:          The maximum basic rate is indexed 6 monthly in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

#### Module C—Pharmaceutical allowance

Qualification for pharmaceutical allowance

  1068A-C1  Subject to points 1068A-C2, 1068A-C3 and 1068A-C5, an additional amount by way of pharmaceutical allowance is to be added to a person’s maximum basic rate if: 

                     (a)  the person is an Australian resident; and

                     (b)  the person is in Australia.

No pharmaceutical allowance if person receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 

  1068A-C2  Pharmaceutical allowance is not to be added to a person’s maximum basic rate if the person is receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.

Note:          A person can receive both:

(a)           a disability pension under the VEA; and

(b)           a payment under this Act;

                   and pharmaceutical allowance might be built into the disability pension rate.

No pharmaceutical allowance before advance payment period ends

  1068A-C3  Pharmaceutical allowance is not to be added to a person’s maximum basic rate if:

                     (a)  the person has received an advance pharmaceutical allowance under:

                              (i)  Part 2.23 of this Act; or

                             (ii)  Division 2 of Part VIIA of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act; and

                     (b)  the person’s advance payment period has not ended.

Note:          For **_advance payment period_** see point 1068A-C4.

Advance payment period

 1068A-C4(1)  A person’s advance payment period starts on the day on which the advance pharmaceutical allowance is paid to the person.

             (2)  The period ends after the number of paydays worked out using the following formula have passed:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image005.gif)

where:

                    <a name="amount-advanc"></a>**_amount of advance_** is the amount of the advance paid to the person.

                    <a name="pharmaceut-allow-rate"></a>**_pharmaceutical allowance rate_** is the yearly amount of pharmaceutical allowance which would be added to the person’s maximum basic rate in working out the person’s rate of pension PP (single) on the day on which the advance is paid if pharmaceutical allowance were to be added to the person’s maximum basic rate on that day.

No pharmaceutical allowance if annual limit reached

  1068A-C5  Pharmaceutical allowance is not to be added to a person’s maximum basic rate if:

                     (a)  the person has received an advance pharmaceutical allowance during the current calendar year; and 

                     (b)  the total amount paid to the person for that year by way of: 

                              (i)  pharmaceutical allowance; and

                             (ii)  advance pharmaceutical allowance;

equals the total amount of pharmaceutical allowance that would have been paid to the person during that year if the person had not received any advance pharmaceutical allowance.

Note 1:       For the amount paid to a person by way of pharmaceutical allowance see subsections 19A(2) to (7).

Note 2:       The annual limit is affected by the following:

(a)         how long during the calendar year the person was on pension or benefit;

(b)      the rate of pharmaceutical allowance the person attracts at various times depending on the person’s family situation.

VEA payments taken into account

  1068A-C6  In points 1068A-C4 and 1068A-C5:

                    <a name="advanc-pharmaceut-allow"></a>**_advance pharmaceutical allowance_** includes advance pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.

                    <a name="pharmaceut-allow"></a>**_pharmaceutical allowance_** includes pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.

Amount of pharmaceutical allowance

  1068A-C7  The amount of pharmaceutical allowance is $140.40 per year ($5.40 per fortnight).

Note:          The annual amount is adjusted annually in line with CPI increases (see section 1206A).

#### Module D—Rent assistance

Qualification for rent assistance

  1068A-D1  An additional amount to help cover the cost of rent is to be added to a person’s maximum basic rate if:

                     (a)  the person is not an ineligible homeowner; and

                     (b)  the person is not an aged care resident; and

                     (c)  the person pays, or is liable to pay, rent (other than Government rent); and

                     (d)  the rent is payable at a rate of more than $1,861.60 per year ($71.60 per fortnight); and

                     (e)  the person is in Australia; and

                      (f)  if the person is receiving family payment in respect of a dependent child who is an FP child—the standard family payment rate of the person does not exceed the minimum family payment rate of the person.

Note 1:       For **_rent_**, **_Government rent_** and **_ineligible homeowner_** see section 13.

Note 2:       The amount in paragraph (d) is indexed 6 monthly in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

Annual rent affects rate of rent assistance

  1068A-D2The rate of rent assistance depends on the annual rent paid or payable by the person.

Rate of rent assistance

  1068A-D3  The rate of rent assistance per fortnight is worked out using Table D. Calculate Rate A for the person using the formula in Column 2\. This will be the person’s rate of rent assistance but only up to the person’s maximum rent assistance rate. If the person is not  a single person sharing accommodation, the person’s maximum rent assistance rate is Rate B in Column 3 of the table. If the person is a single person sharing accommodation, the person’s maximum rent assistance rate is two-thirds of Rate B.

Annual rent

  1068A-D4  Annual rent is the annual rent paid or payable by the person.

#### Module E—Ordinary income test

Effect of income on maximum payment rate

  1068A-E1  This is how to work out the effect of a person’s ordinary income on the person’s maximum payment rate:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the amount of the person’s ordinary income on a yearly basis.

_Step 2._   Work out the person’s ordinary income free area (see points 1068A-E14 to 1068A-E18 below).

                   Note:             A person’s ordinary income free area is the amount of ordinary income that the person can have without any deduction being made from the person’s maximum payment rate.

_Step 3._   Work out whether the person’s ordinary income exceeds the person’s ordinary income free area.

_Step 4._   If the person’s ordinary income does not exceed the person’s ordinary income free area, the person’s ordinary income excess is nil.

_Step 5._   If the person’s ordinary income exceeds the person’s ordinary income free area, the person’s ordinary income excess is the person’s ordinary income less the person’s ordinary income free area.

_Step 6._   Use the person’s ordinary income excess to work out the person’s reduction for ordinary income using points 1068A-E19 and 1068A-E20 below.

* * *

Note 1:       See point 1068A-A1 (Steps 5 and 6) for the significance of the person’s reduction for ordinary income.

Note 2:       The application of the ordinary income test is affected by provisions concerning the following:

(a)           the general concept of ordinary income (sections 1072 and 1073);

(b)           business income (sections 1074 and 1075);

(c)           deemed income from financial assets (sections 1076 to 1084);

(d)           income from retirement funds and annuities (sections 1095 to 1099);

(e)           disposal of income (sections 1106 to 1112).

Roll-over of lump sum leave payments

  1068A-E2  If:

                     (a)  a person’s employment has been terminated; and

                     (b)  as a result the person is entitled to a lump sum leave payment from the person’s former employer; and

                     (c)  the person rolls over the lump sum leave payment into an approved deposit fund, a superannuation fund or a deferred annuity;

the lump sum leave payment is to be disregarded in working out the ordinary income of the person for the purposes of this Module.

Certain leave payments taken to be ordinary income—employment continuing

  1068A-E3  If:

                     (a)  a person is employed; and

                     (b)  the person is on leave for a period; and

                     (c)  the person is or was entitled to receive a leave payment (whether as a lump sum payment, as a payment that is one of a series of regular payments or otherwise) in respect of a part or all of the leave period;

the person is taken to have received ordinary income for a period (the **_income maintenance period_**) equal to the leave period to which the leave payment entitlement relates.

Certain leave payments taken to be ordinary income—employment terminated

  1068A-E4  If:

                     (a)  a person’s employment has been terminated; and

                     (b)  the person receives a leave payment (whether as a lump sum payment, as a payment that is one of a series of regular payments or otherwise);

the person is taken to have received ordinary income for a period (the **_income maintenance period_**) equal to the leave period to which the payment relates.

More than one leave payment on a day

  1068A-E5  If:

                     (a)  the person is covered by point 1068A-E4; and

                     (b)  the person receives more than one leave payment on a day;

the income maintenance period is worked out by adding the leave periods to which the payments relate.

Start of income maintenance period—employment continuing

  1068A-E6  If the person is covered by point 1068A-E3, the income maintenance period starts on the first day of the leave period to which the leave payment entitlement relates.

Start of income maintenance period—employment terminated

  1068A-E7  If the person is covered by point 1068A-E4, the income maintenance period starts, subject to point 1068A-E8, on the day the person is paid the leave payment.

Commencement of income maintenance period where there is a second leave payment—employment terminated

  1068A-E8  If a person who is covered by point 1068A-E4 is subject to an income maintenance period (the **_first period_**) and the person is paid another leave payment during that period (the **_second leave payment_**), the income maintenance period for the second leave payment commences on the day after the end of the first period.

Secretary may determine in certain circumstances that the whole or part of an income maintenance period does not apply

  1068A-E9  The Secretary may determine that the whole or any part of an income maintenance period that would, apart from this point, apply to the person does not apply to the person if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the application of the income maintenance period to the person would cause the person severe financial hardship; and

                     (b)  the circumstances that would cause the severe financial hardship were not reasonably foreseeable by the person.

When a person receives a leave payment

 1068A-E10  For the purposes of points 1068A-E2 to 1068A-E9 (inclusive), a person (the **_first person_**) is taken to receive a leave payment if the payment is made to another person:

                     (a)  at the direction of the first person or a court; or

                     (b)  on behalf of the first person; or

                     (c)  for the benefit of the first person; or

the first person waives or assigns the first person’s right to receive the payment.

Single payment in respect of different kinds of leave—employment terminated

 1068A-E11  If a person who is covered by point 1068A-E4 receives a single payment in respect of different kinds of leave, then, for the purposes of the application of points 1068A-E2 to 1068A-E10 (inclusive), each part of the payment that is in respect of a different kind of leave is taken to be a separate payment and the income maintenance period in respect of the single payment is worked out by adding the leave periods to which the separate payments relate.

Definitions

 1068A-E12  In points 1068A-E2 to 1068A-E12 (inclusive):

                    <a name="leav-payment"></a>**_leave payment_** includes a payment in respect of sick leave, annual leave, maternity leave and long service leave.

                    <a name="roll"></a><a name="roll"></a>**_roll-over_**, in relation to a lump sum leave payment, has the same meaning as **_roll-over_** in section 27D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to an eligible termination payment.

Payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments

 1068A-E13  If:

                     (a)  at the time of an event that gives rise to an entitlement of a person to compensation, the person is receiving a compensation affected payment; and

                     (b)  in relation to that entitlement, the person receives a payment of arrears of periodic compensation;

the person is taken to receive, on each day in the periodic payments period, an amount calculated by dividing the amount received by the number of days in the periodic payments period.

Note:          For **_compensation affected payment_** and **_periodic payments period_** see section 17.

How to calculate a person’s ordinary income free area

 1068A-E14  A person’s ordinary income free area is worked out using Table E. The ordinary income free area is the amount in Column 2 plus the additional amount in Column 4 for each dependent child of the person.

</tr></table>

Note 1:       For **_dependent child_** see section 5.

Note 2:       The basic free area per year is indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

No additional free area for certain prescribed student children

1068A-E15No additional free area is to be added for a dependent child who:

                     (a)  has turned 18; and

                     (b)  is a prescribed student child;

unless the person whose rate is being calculated receives child disability allowance for the child.

Reduction of additional free area for dependent children

 1068A-E16  The additional free area for a dependent child is reduced by the annual amount of any payment received by the person for or in respect of that particular child. The payments referred to in point 1068A-E17 do not result in a reduction.

Payments that do not reduce additional free area

 1068A-E17  No reduction is to be made under point 1068A-E16 for a payment:

                     (a)  under this Act; or

                     (b)  of maintenance income; or

                     (c)  under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act; or

                     (d)  under an Aboriginal study assistance scheme or the AUSTUDY scheme; or

                     (e)  under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme.

Note:          For **_Aboriginal study assistance scheme_** see subsection 23(1).

Examples of payments reducing additional free area

 1068A-E18Examples of the kinds of payments that result in a reduction under point 1068A-E16 are:

                     (a)  amounts received from State authorities or benevolent societies in respect of the boarding out of the child; or

                     (b)  amounts of superannuation or compensation paid in respect of the child; or

                     (c)  amounts (other than amounts covered by point 1068A-E17) paid in respect of the child under educational schemes; or

                     (d)  foster care allowance payments made by a State welfare authority.

Example:

Facts:         Mary is a lone parent with 2 dependent children, Jim and Susan. Mary is getting a compensation payment for Jim at the rate of $40 a month. On a yearly basis, this amounts to $480.

Result:       Point 1068A-E16 applies to Mary (see paragraph 1068A-E18(b)). As a result, the possible additional free area for Jim ($624) must be reduced by $480.

                   Mary’s ordinary income free area per year is therefore:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image007.gif)

Ordinary income excess

1068A-E19A person’s ordinary income excess is the person’s ordinary income less the person’s ordinary income free area.

Reduction for ordinary income

1068A-E20  A person’s reduction for ordinary income is:

#### Module F—Remote area allowance

Remote area allowance

  1068A-F1  An amount by way of remote area allowance is to be added to a person’s rate if:

                     (a)  either:

                              (i)  the person’s rate apart from this point is greater than nil; or

                             (ii)  apart from this point the person’s rate would be nil merely because an advance pharmaceutical allowance has been paid to the person under:

                                        (A)  Part 2.23 of this Act; or

                                        (B)  Division 2 of Part VIIA of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act; and

                     (b)  the person’s usual place of residence is situated in a remote area; and

                     (c)  the person is physically present in the remote area.

Note:          For **_remote area_** and **_physically present in the remote area_** see section 14.

Rate of remote area allowance

  1068A-F2  The rate of remote area allowance payable to a person is worked out using Table F. The rate of remote area allowance is the amount in Column 2 plus the additional corresponding amount in Column 4 for each FP child of the person.

Dependent children must be physically present in Australia

  1068A-F3  Additional allowance is not payable for an FP child unless the child is physically present in Australia.

Note:          For **_FP child_** see section 6.

##### <a id="1068B"></a>1068B  Rate of parenting payment—PP (partnered)

             (1)  If a person is a member of a couple, the person’s rate of parenting payment is the PP (partnered) rate.

             (2)   The PP (partnered) rate is worked out in accordance with the rate calculator at the end of this section.

             (3)  If the Secretary determines in writing a higher amount in substitution for an existing amount in the rate calculator at the end of this section, the higher amount is taken, from and including 20 March 1998, to be substituted for the existing amount. A determination under this subsection is a disallowable instrument.

             (4)  In subsection (3):

                    <a name="existing-amount"></a>**_existing amount_** means an amount referred to in any of the following:

                     (a)  point 1068B-B6;

  1068B-A1  The rate of PP (partnered) is a fortnightly rate. There are 2 ways of working out the rate, one for non-benefit PP (partnered) (see point 1068B-A2) and the other for benefit PP (partnered) (see point 1068B-A3). Use Module B to decide whether parenting payment is a non-benefit PP (partnered) or a benefit PP (partnered). 

Method of calculating rate—non-benefit PP (partnered)

  1068B-A2  If parenting payment is a non-benefit PP (partnered), the rate is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the person’s **_maximum basic rate_** using Module C below.

_Step 2._   Apply the income test using Module D below to work out the person’s income reduction.

                   Note:             There is no partner income reduction for the income test for non-benefit PP (partnered)—see paragraph 1068B-D23(a) and point 1068B-D24.

_Step 3._   Take the income reduction away from the person’s maximum basic rate: the result is the **_provisional payment rate_**.

_Step 4._ The rate of non-benefit PP (partnered) is the difference between the provisional payment rate and any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A).

* * *

Method of calculating rate—benefit PP (partnered)

  1068B-A3  If parenting payment is a benefit PP (partnered), the rate of parenting payment is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the person’s **_maximum basic rate_** using Module C below.

_Step 2._   Apply the income test using Module D below to work out the person’s income reduction.

_Step 3._   Take the income reduction away from the person’s maximum basic rate: the result is the **_income reduced rate_**.

                   Note:             The result may be a negative amount.

_Step 4._   Identify the higher of the following amounts:

               (a)     the remaining partner income reduction (see point 1068B-D26);

               (b)     the amount (if any) by which the person’s excess amount (worked out under Step 4 of the Method statement in point 1068B-D32) exceeds the person’s personal income reduction calculated under Step 5 of the Method statement in point 1068B-D32.

              The amount is the **_further income reduction_**.

_Step 5._   Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of rent assistance (see Module F below). Take away from the amount per fortnight of rent assistance so much of the further income reduction as does not exceed the amount per fortnight of rent assistance. The result is the **_rent assistance amount_**.

_Step 6._ Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance (see Module E below). Take away from it any amount of further income reduction not applied to reduce the rent assistance amount under Step 5: the result is the **_pharmaceutical allowance amount_**.

_Step 7._   Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 3, 5 and 6: the result is called the **_provisional payment rate_**. If the result is a negative amount the provisional payment rate is taken to be nil.

_Step 8._ The rate of benefit PP (partnered) is the difference between:

               (a)     the provisional payment rate; and

               (b)     any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A);

              plus any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see Module G).

* * *

Maximum payment rate

  1068B-A4  For the purposes of this Act, a person’s **_maximum payment rate_** of PP (partnered) is the sum of:

                     (a)  the person’s maximum basic rate (see Module C below); and

                     (b)  the amount per fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance (see Module E below); and

                     (c)  any applicable additional amount for rent (see Module F below).

#### Module B—Non-benefit and benefit PP (partnered)

Non-benefit PP (partnered) and benefit PP (partnered)

  1068B-B1  The question whether parenting payment payable to a person is a non-benefit PP (partnered) or a benefit PP (partnered) is decided as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   If point 1068B-B2 applies to the person, parenting payment is a non-benefit PP (partnered).

_Step 2._   If the value of the person’s assets exceeds the person’s assets value limit (see points 1068B-B3 to 1068B-B5), or if the person has not provided information on the value of the person’s assets, parenting payment is a non-benefit PP (partnered).

_Step 3._   If the person has not provided information on the amount of the income of the person’s partner, parenting payment is a non-benefit PP (partnered).

_Step 4._ If Step 1, 2 or 3 does not apply, work out the person’s **_hypothetical rate of PP (partnered)_** under point 1068B-B7.

_Step 5._ If the rate worked out under Step 4 is greater than nil, parenting payment is a benefit PP (partnered).

_Step 6._ If the rate worked out under Step 4 is nil, parenting payment is a non-benefit PP (partnered).

* * *

Note:          The rate of benefit PP (partnered) is calculated using the Method statement in point 1068B-A3\. That Method statement operates to protect the rate of benefit PP (partnered) from falling below that which would apply if a person were a non-benefit PP (partnered) recipient. Benefit PP (partnered) status applies to a person whose income reduction calculated without this protection would not preclude payment of parenting payment. The hypothetical rate is calculated without any rate protection to determine if this condition is met.

Parenting payment received by certain persons taken to be non-benefit PP (partnered)

  1068B-B2  This point applies to a person if:

                     (a)  the person is receiving a social security pension or a service pension; or

                     (b)  the person is an armed services widow or an armed services widower; or

                     (c)  the person’s partner is receiving an AUSTUDY allowance that includes a dependent spouse allowance; or

                     (d)  because of the application of subsection 1164(7) or 1165(2B), the person’s rate of parenting payment is equal to the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068B-B6.

Method of working out assets value limit

  1068B-B3  A person’s assets value limit is worked out using the following table: work out which situation applies to the person; the assets value limit is the corresponding amount in the appropriate **_assets value limit_** column.

Note 1:       For **_partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit)_** and **_partnered (partner getting pension or benefit)_** see subsection 4(11).

Note 2:       For **_homeowner_** see subsection 11(4).

Note 3:       If item 1 applies to a person, the value of all the assets of the person’s partner are to be taken as being included in the value of the person’s assets (see point 1068B-B4). If item 2 applies to a person, the value of the person’s assets is only half the combined value of the person’s assets and the assets of the person’s partner (see point 1068B-B5).

Note 4:       If benefit PP (partnered) is not payable to a person because of the value of the person’s assets, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with financial hardship (see sections 1131 and 1132).

Note 5:       The assets value limits of item 2 are indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

Note 6:       The item 1 assets value limits are adjusted annually so that they are twice the corresponding item 2 limits (see subsections 1204(2) and (3)).

Partner not receiving pension or benefit

  1068B-B4  If the person is partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit):

                     (a)  the value of the person’s assets includes the value of the partner’s assets; and

                     (b)  the value of assets of a particular kind of the person includes the assets of that kind of the partner.

Note:          For **_partnered (partner getting neither pension nor benefit)_** see subsection 4(11).

Partner receiving pension or benefit

  1068B-B5  If the person is partnered (partner getting pension or benefit):

                     (a)  the value of the person’s assets is taken to be 50% of the sum of the value of the assets of the person and the value of the assets of the person’s partner; and

                     (b)  the value of the person’s assets of a particular kind are taken to be 50% of the sum of the value of the assets of that kind of the person and the value of the assets of that kind of the person’s partner.

Note:          For **_partnered (partner getting pension or benefit)_** see subsection 4(11).

Maximum basic component of parenting payment

  1068B-B6  For the purposes of this Act, the maximum basic component of parenting payment is $65.10 per fortnight.

Note:          The amount is indexed 6 monthly in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

Method of calculating the hypothetical rate: Step 4 of Method statement in point 1068B-B1

  1068B-B7  For the purposes of Step 4 of the Method statement in point 1068B-B1, a person’s **_hypothetical rate of PP (partnered)_** is worked out as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the person’s **_maximum basic rate_** using point 1068B-C2.

_Step 2._   Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of rent assistance under Module F below as if paragraph 1068B-F1(a) were omitted.

_Step 3._   Work out the amount per fortnight (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance under Module E below as if:

               (a)     any advance payment of pharmaceutical allowance under Part 2.23 of this Act, or Division 2 of Part VIIA of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, had not been made; and

               (b)     paragraph 1068B-E1(a) were omitted.

_Step 4._ Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 1, 2 and 3: the result is called the **_maximum payment rate_**.

_Step 5._ Apply the income test, using Module D below as if points 1068B-D25 and 1068B-D32 were omitted, to work out the person’s **_income reduction_**.

_Step 6._ Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the **_provisional payment rate_**.

_Step 7._   Work out the amount of any reduction applicable under section 1168 as if subsections 1168(6) and 1168(7) were omitted.

                   Note:             Section 1168 provides for the reduction of certain compensation affected payments where periodic compensation payments are received.

_Step 8._   Take away the result obtained in Step 7 from the provisional payment rate: the result is the person’s **_hypothetical rate_**.

* * *

#### Module C—Maximum basic rate

Maximum basic rate—non-benefit PP (partnered)

  1068B-C1  If parenting payment payable to a person is a non-benefit PP (partnered), the person’s maximum basic rate is an amount equal to the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068B-B6.

Maximum basic rate—benefit PP (partnered)

  1068B-C2  If parenting payment payable to a person is a benefit PP (partnered), the person’s maximum basic rate is worked out using Table C. Work out the person’s family situation. The maximum basic rate is the corresponding amount in Column 3.

#### Module D—Income test

Effect of income on maximum payment rate

  1068B-D1  This is how to work out the effect of a person’s ordinary income, and (if applicable) the ordinary income of the person’s partner, on the person’s maximum basic rate:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out the amount of the person’s ordinary income on a fortnightly basis.

                   Note:             The amount of the person’s ordinary income is affected by points 1068B-D2 to 1068B-D21.

_Step 2_.   Work out the partner income free area using point 1068B-D22.

                   Note:             The partner income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary income the person’s partner can have without affecting the person’s rate.

_Step 3._   Use point 1068B-D23 to work out the person’s partner income excess.

_Step 4._   Use the person’s partner income excess to work out the person’s partner income reduction using points 1068B-D24 and 1068B-D25.

_Step 5._   Work out whether the person’s ordinary income exceeds the person’s ordinary income free area (see point 1068B-D27).

                   Note:             A person’s ordinary income free area is the maximum amount of ordinary income the person can have without affecting the person’s rate.

_Step 6._   If the person’s ordinary income does not exceed the person’s ordinary income free area, the person’s ordinary income excess is nil.

_Step 7._   If the person’s ordinary income exceeds the person’s ordinary income free area, the person’s ordinary income excess is the person’s ordinary income less the person’s ordinary income free area.

_Step 8._   Use the person’s ordinary income excess to work out the person’s **_ordinary income reduction_** using points 1068B-D29 to 1068B-D32.

_Step 9._   Add the person’s ordinary income reduction and partner income reduction: the result is the person’s income reduction referred to in Step 2 of the Method statement in points 1068B-A2 and 1068B-A3.

* * *

Note 1:        For **_ordinary income_** see section 8.

Note 2:       See points 1068B-A2 (Step 3) and 1068B-A3 (Step 3) for the significance of the person’s income reduction.

Note 3:       The application of the ordinary income test is affected by provisions concerning the following:

(a)           the general concept of ordinary income (sections 1072 and 1073);

(b)           business income (sections 1074 and 1075);

(c)           deemed income from financial assets (sections 1076 to 1084);

(d)           income from retirement funds and annuities (sections 1095 to 1099);

(e)           disposal of income (sections 1106 to 1112).

Ordinary income of members of certain couples

  1068B-D2  If a person’s partner is receiving a social security pension or a service pension, the person’s ordinary income is taken to be one half of the sum of:

                     (a)  the amount that would be the person’s ordinary income if he or she were not a member of a couple; and

                     (b)  the amount that would be the ordinary income of the person’s partner if the partner were not a member of a couple.

Note:          Point 1068B-D32 limits the extent to which this way of working out a person’s ordinary income can reduce the person’s rate of parenting payment.

Ordinary income of pensioners and armed services widows

1068B-D3  For the purposes of this Module, the ordinary income of the person whose rate is being calculated is taken to include:

                     (a)  any payment to the person of a social security pension or a service pension other than any part of such a payment by way of rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance or remote area allowance; and

                     (b)  if the person is an armed services widow—any payment to the person of a social security benefit other than any part of such a payment by way of rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance or remote area allowance.

Friendly society amounts

  1068B-D4  The ordinary income of a person to whose partner a sickness allowance is payable is not to include any amount received by the person from an approved friendly society in respect of the incapacity because of which the partner is qualified for the sickness allowance.

Note:          For **_approved friendly society_** see subsection 23(1).

Ordinary income includes certain periodical payments from relatives

  1068B-D5  Subject to point 1068B-D6, in this Module, a person’s ordinary income includes a periodical payment or benefit by way of gift or allowance from the father, mother, son, daughter, brother or sister of the person.

Note:          Point 1068B-D5 reverses paragraph 8(8)(z) which excludes these amounts.

Board and lodging

  1068B-D6  A person’s ordinary income is not to include a payment to the person for board or lodging provided by the person to the person’s father, mother, son, daughter, brother or sister.

Termination payments

  1068B-D7  Subject to points 1068B-D8 to 1068B-D18 (inclusive), if:

                     (a)  a person’s employment has been terminated; and

                     (b)  as a result, the person is entitled to a lump sum payment from the person’s former employer;

the person is taken to have received the lump sum payment on the day on which the person’s employment was terminated.

Roll-over of lump sum leave payments

  1068B-D8  If:

                     (a)  a person’s employment has been terminated; and

                     (b)  as a result, the person is entitled to a lump sum leave payment from the person’s former employer; and

                     (c)  the person rolls over the lump sum leave payment into an approved deposit fund, a superannuation fund or a deferred annuity;

the lump sum leave payment is to be disregarded in working out the ordinary income of the person for the purposes of this Module.

Certain leave payments taken to be ordinary income—employment continuing

  1068B-D9  If:

                     (a)  a person is employed; and

                     (b)  the person is on leave for a period; and

                     (c)  the person is or was entitled to receive a leave payment (whether as a lump sum payment, as a payment that is one of a series of regular payments or otherwise) in respect of a part or all of the leave period;

the person is taken to have received ordinary income for a period (the **_income maintenance period_**) equal to the leave period to which the leave payment entitlement relates.

Certain leave payments taken to be ordinary income—employment terminated

 1068B-D10  If:

                     (a)  a person’s employment has been terminated; and

                     (b)  the person receives a leave payment (whether as a lump sum payment, as a payment that is one of a series of regular payments or otherwise);

the person is taken to have received ordinary income for a period (the **_income maintenance period_**) equal to the leave period to which the payment relates.

More than one leave payment on a day

 1068B-D11  If:

                     (a)  the person is covered by point 1068B-D10; and

                     (b)  the person receives more than one leave payment on a day;

the income maintenance period is worked out by adding the leave periods to which the payments relate.

Start of income maintenance period—employment continuing

 1068B-D12  If the person is covered by point 1068B-D9, the income maintenance period starts on the first day of the leave period to which the leave payment entitlement relates.

Start of income maintenance period—employment terminated

 1068B-D13  If the person is covered by point 1068B-D10, the income maintenance period starts, subject to point 1068B-D14, on the day the person is paid the leave payment.

Commencement of income maintenance period where there is a second leave payment—employment terminated

 1068B-D14  If a person who is covered by point 1068B-D10 is subject to an income maintenance period (the **_first period_**) and the person is paid another leave payment during that period (the **_second leave payment_**), the income maintenance period for the second leave payment commences the day after the end of the first period.

Secretary may determine in certain circumstances that the whole or part of an income maintenance period does not apply

 1068B-D15  The Secretary may determine that the whole or any part of an income maintenance period that would, apart from this point, apply to the person does not apply to the person if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the application of the income maintenance period to the person would cause the person severe financial hardship; and

                     (b)  the circumstances that would cause the severe financial hardship were not reasonably foreseeable by the person.

When a person receives a leave payment

 1068B-D16  For the purposes of points 1068B-D8 to 1068B-D15 (inclusive), a person (the **_first person_**) is taken to receive a leave payment if the payment is made to another person:

                     (a)  at the direction of the first person or a court; or

                     (b)  on behalf of the first person; or

                     (c)  for the benefit of the first person; or

the first person waives or assigns the first person’s right to receive the payment.

Single payment in respect of different kinds of leave—employment terminated

 1068B-D17  If a person who is covered by point 1068B-D10 receives a single payment in respect of different kinds of leave, then, for the purposes of the application of points 1068B-D8 to 1068B-D16 (inclusive), each part of the payment that is in respect of a different kind of leave is taken to be a separate payment and the income maintenance period in respect of the single payment is worked out by adding the leave periods to which the separate payments relate.

Definitions

 1068B-D18  In points 1068B-D8 to 1068B-D18 (inclusive):

                    <a name="leav-payment"></a>**_leave payment_** includes a payment in respect of sick leave, annual leave, maternity leave and long service leave.

                    <a name="roll"></a><a name="roll"></a>**_roll-over_**, in relation to a lump sum leave payment, has the same meaning as **_roll-over_** in section 27D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to an eligible termination payment.

Period over which ordinary income taken into account

 1068B-D19  Subject to points 1068B-D8 to 1068B-D18 (inclusive), a person’s ordinary income is to be taken into account over such period, not exceeding 52 weeks, as the Secretary determines.

Note:          This point, in conjunction with point 1068B-D20, enables the Secretary to determine the person’s fortnightly income amount that best represents the person’s income situation.

Example 1: Barbara has a casual job. She regularly works 8 hours in one fortnight and 12 in the next. This provides her with income of $80 and $120 in the respective fortnights. The Secretary determines that each income amount will be spread over a period of two fortnights, resulting in a fortnightly income under point 1068B-D20 of $100.

Example 2: Barbara’s partner, Ian, is a commission based salesperson. In the last year he has received 7 payments at irregular intervals, totalling $13,000\. The Secretary determines that each income amount will be spread over a period of 52 weeks, resulting in a fortnightly income under point 1068B-D20 of $500.

Fortnightly rate of ordinary income

 1068B-D20  For the purposes of this Module, the person’s ordinary income for such a period is to be reduced to a fortnightly rate rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents downwards).

Payment of arrears of periodic compensation payments

 1068B-D21  If:

                     (a)  at the time of an event that gives rise to an entitlement of a person to compensation, the person is receiving a compensation affected payment; and

                     (b)  in relation to that entitlement, the person receives a payment of arrears of periodic compensation;

the person is taken to receive, on each day in the periodic payments period, an amount calculated by dividing the amount received by the number of days in the periodic payments period.

Note:          For **_compensation affected payment_** and **_periodic payments period_** see section 17.

Partner income free area

 1068B-D22  The partner income free area for a person is:

                     (a)  if the person is not receiving a social security benefit or a youth training allowance—the amount of income of the person (rounded up to the nearest dollar) beyond which newstart allowance would not be payable to the person if the person were qualified for a newstart allowance; or

                     (b)  if the person is receiving a social security benefit or a youth training allowance—the amount of income of the person (rounded up to the nearest dollar) beyond which that benefit or allowance would not be payable to the person.

Partner income excess

 1068B-D23  If:

                     (a)  the person’s parenting payment is a benefit PP (partnered); and

                     (b)  the person’s partner is not receiving a social security pension or a service pension; and

                     (c)  the partner’s ordinary income exceeds the partner income free area for the partner;

the person’s partner income excess is the amount by which the partner’s ordinary income exceeds the partner income free area. Otherwise, the person’s partner income excess is nil.

Partner income reduction

 1068B-D24  Subject to point 1068B-D25, if a person has a partner income excess, the person’s partner income reduction is an amount equal to 70% of the part of the partner’s ordinary income that exceeds the partner income free area.

Limit on partner income reduction

 1068B-D25  If the person’s maximum basic rate less the amount that, apart from this point, would be the person’s partner income reduction does not exceed the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068B-B6, the person’s partner income reduction is taken to be the difference between:

                     (a)  the person’s maximum basic rate; and

                     (b)  the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068B-B6.

Remaining partner income reduction

 1068B-D26  If the person’s partner income reduction is worked out under point 1068B-D25, the person’s remaining partner income reduction (referred to in Step 4 of the Method statement in point 1068B-A3) is taken to be the difference between:

                     (a)  the amount worked out under point 1068B-D24; and

                     (b)  the amount worked out under point 1068B-D25.

Example:

Facts:         Assume the following:

(a)           Barbara’s partner, Benny, has an ordinary income of $840;

(b)           the partner income free area for Benny under point 1068B-D22 is $498;

(c)           Barbara’s parenting payment is a benefit parenting payment;

(d)           Barbara’s maximum basic rate is $290.10;

(e)           Barbara’s maximum basic component under point 1068B-B6 is $65.10.

Result:       Benny’s ordinary income exceeds the partner income free area. He therefore has a partner income excess under point 1068B-D23 of:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image009.gif)

                   Barbara’s partner income reduction under point 1068D-D24 is therefore:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image010.gif)

                   However, under point 1068B-D25, her partner income reduction cannot exceed the difference between her maximum basic rate and the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068A-B6\. This difference is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image011.gif)

                   Therefore, Barbara’s partner income reduction is $225\. Under point 1068B-D26, her remaining partner income reduction is the difference between the point 1068B-D24 amount and the point 1068B-D25 amount. This difference is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image012.gif)

Ordinary income free area

 1068B-D27  A person’s ordinary income free area is $60.

Ordinary income excess

 1068B-D28  If a person’s ordinary income exceeds the person’s ordinary income free area:

                     (a)  the person has an ordinary income excess; and

                     (b)  the person’s ordinary income excess is the amount by which the person’s ordinary income exceeds the person’s ordinary income free area.

Ordinary income reduction

 1068B-D29  If a person has an ordinary income excess, the person’s ordinary income reduction is the sum of:

                     (a)  the person’s lower range reduction (see point 1068B-D30); and

                     (b)  the person’s upper range reduction (if any) (see point 1068B-D31).

Note:          The ordinary income reduction worked out under this point may be altered under point 1068B-D32.

Lower range reduction

 1068B-D30  The person’s lower range reduction is an amount equal to 50% of the part of the person’s ordinary income excess that does not exceed $80.

Upper range reduction

 1068B-D31  The person’s upper range reduction is an amount equal to 70% of the part (if any) of the person’s ordinary income excess that exceeds $80.

Example:

Facts:         Further to the Example at the end of point 1068B-D26 assume Barbara’s ordinary income is $130\. Her partner Benny is not receiving a social security pension or a service pension.

Result:       Barbara’s ordinary income free area under point 1068B-D27 is $60.

                   Her ordinary income exceeds her ordinary income free area. She therefore has an ordinary income excess under point 1068B-D28 of:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image013.gif)

                   Because her ordinary income excess does not exceed $80:

(a)           her lower range reduction under point 1068B-D30 is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image014.gif)

(b)           there is no upper range reduction under point 1068B-D31.

                   Her ordinary income reduction under point 1068B-D29 is therefore $35.

Alteration of ordinary income reduction for members of certain couples

 1068B-D32  If the person’s partner is receiving a social security pension or a service pension, use the following Method statement to determine whether the person’s ordinary income reduction, as worked out under point 1068B-D29, should be altered:

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._   Work out whether the person’s ordinary income reduction would, apart from this point, have the effect of reducing the person’s maximum basic rate to an amount that is less than the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068B-B6.

                   Note:             Point 1068B-D2 will apply to working out the person’s ordinary income. There will be no partner income excess (see point 1068B-D23).

_Step 2._   If it would not reduce the person’s maximum basic rate to that extent, the person’s ordinary income reduction is not altered under this point.

_Step 3._   If it would reduce the person’s maximum basic rate to that extent, work out:

               (a)     the person’s excess amount under Step 4; and

               (b)     the person’s personal income reduction under Step 5.

_Step 4._   The person’s **_excess amount_** is the amount by which the person’s ordinary income reduction would, apart from this point, reduce the person’s maximum basic rate below the maximum basic component of parenting payment.

_Step 5._   The person’s **_personal income reduction_** is the amount that would have been the person’s ordinary income reduction under this Module if:

               (a)     the person’s parenting payment were a non-benefit PP (partnered); and

               (b)     point 1068B-D2 did not apply (that is, if the income of the person’s partner were not taken into account in working out the person’s ordinary income).

_Step 6._   If Step 3 applies, the person’s ordinary income reduction is the sum of:

               (a)     the difference between the person’s maximum basic rate and the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068B-B6; and

               (b)     whichever is the lesser of the person’s excess amount and the person’s personal income reduction.

* * *

Example:

Facts:         Margaret is receiving benefit PP (partnered). Her partner Reg has an ordinary income of $800\. He is receiving a social security pension. Margaret’s ordinary income is $80\. Assume that Margaret’s maximum basic rate under point 1068B-C2 is $290.10 and that the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068B-B6 is $65.10.

Result:       Margaret’s ordinary income is calculated under point 1068B-D2\. (As Reg is receiving a social security pension, Margaret has no partner income excess under point 1068B-D23). Her ordinary income is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image015.gif)

                   Margaret’s ordinary income free area under point 1068B-D27 is $60\. Her ordinary income exceeds her ordinary income free area. She therefore has an ordinary income excess of:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image016.gif)

                   Because her ordinary income excess exceeds $80:

(a)           her lower range reduction under point 1068B-D30 is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image017.gif)

(b)           her upper range reduction under point 1068B-D31 is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image018.gif)

                   Disregarding point 1068B-D32, her ordinary income reduction under point 1068B-D29 is therefore:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image019.gif)

                   The application of this ordinary income reduction to Margaret’s maximum basic rate yields a result of:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image020.gif)

                   This is less than the maximum basic component of parenting payment under point 1068B-B6 ($65.10). The excess amount under Step 4 of the Method statement in point 1068B-D32 is therefore:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image021.gif)

                   Margaret’s personal income reduction is now worked out under Step 5 of the Method statement in point 1068B-D32 as if point 1068B-D2 does not apply and as if Margaret’s parenting payment were a non-benefit PP (partnered). Her ordinary income excess worked out on this basis is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image022.gif)

                   Because this figure does not exceed $80:

(a)           her lower range reduction under point 1068B-D30 is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image023.gif)

(b)           there is no upper range reduction under point 1068B-D31.

                   Her personal income reduction under point 1068B-D29 is therefore $10.

                   Margaret’s personal income reduction ($10) is less than her excess amount ($25). Therefore under Step 6 of the Method statement in point 1068B-D32, Margaret’s ordinary income reduction is $235, being the sum of:

(a)           the difference between her maximum basic rate and the maximum basic component of parenting payment, that is:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image024.gif)

(b)           her personal income reduction of $10.

                   Margaret’s rate of benefit PP (partnered) is therefore:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image025.gif)

#### Module E—Pharmaceutical allowance

Qualification for pharmaceutical allowance

  1068B-E1  Subject to points 1068B-E2, 1068B-E3, 1068B-E4 and 1068B-E6, an additional amount by way of pharmaceutical allowance is to be included in a person’s provisional payment rate in point 1068B-A3 if:

                     (a)  the person’s parenting payment is a benefit PP (partnered); and

                     (b)  the person is an Australian resident, or has a qualifying residence exemption for parenting payment; and

                     (c)  the person is in Australia; and

                     (d)  the person has turned 60; and

                     (e)  the person has been receiving income support payments in respect of a continuous period of at least 9 months (whether or not the kind of payment received has changed over the period and whether the period or any part of it occurred before or after the commencement of this paragraph).

Note 1:       For **_income support payment_** see subsection 23(1).

Note 2:       For the determination of the continuous period in respect of which a person received income support payments see section 38B.

Note 3:       For **_Australian resident_** and **_qualifying residence exemption_** see section 7.

No pharmaceutical allowance if person receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act

  1068B-E2  A person is not qualified to receive pharmaceutical allowance if the person is receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.

Note:          A person can receive both:

(a)           a disability pension under the VEA; and

(b)           a payment under this Act;

                   and pharmaceutical allowance might be built into the disability pension rate.

No pharmaceutical allowance if partner receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and not a service pensioner

  1068B-E3  A person is not qualified to receive pharmaceutical allowance if:

                     (a)  the person’s partner is receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act; and

                     (b)  the person’s partner is not receiving a service pension.

Note:          If paragraphs (a) and (b) apply to the person’s partner, the partner is receiving pharmaceutical allowance under the VEA at the higher rate (rather than the person and the person’s partner each receiving pharmaceutical allowance at the lower rate).

No pharmaceutical allowance before advance payment period ends

  1068B-E4  Pharmaceutical allowance is not to be included in a person’s provisional payment rate if:

                     (a)  the person has received an advance pharmaceutical allowance under:

                              (i)  Part 2.23 of this Act; or

                             (ii)  Division 2 of Part VIIA of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act; and

                     (b)  the person’s advance payment period has not ended.

Note:          For **_advance payment period_** see point 1068B-E5.

Advance payment period

 1068B-E5(1)  A person’s advance payment period starts on the day on which the advance pharmaceutical allowance is paid to the person.

             (2)  The period ends after the number of paydays worked out using the following formula have passed:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2010C00284/Html/SocialSecLegAmendParentingOtherMea1997_image005.gif)

where:

                    <a name="amount-advanc"></a>**_amount of advance_** is the amount of the advance paid to the person.

                    <a name="pharmaceut-allow-rate"></a>**_pharmaceutical allowance rate_** is the fortnightly amount of pharmaceutical allowance which would be included in the person’s provisional payment rate in point 1068B-A3 in working out the PP (partnered) instalment for the day on which the advance is paid if parenting payment were payable to the person and pharmaceutical allowance were to be included in the person’s provisional payment rate in point 1068B-A3 on that day.

Note:          The person may have commenced receiving parenting payment after  having been a pension recipient and have received an advance while a pension recipient.

No pharmaceutical allowance if annual limit reached

  1068B-E6  Pharmaceutical allowance is not to be included in a person’s provisional payment rate if:

                     (a)  the person has received an advance pharmaceutical allowance during the current calendar year; and

                     (b)  the total amount paid to the person for that year by way of:

                              (i)  pharmaceutical allowance; and

                             (ii)  advance pharmaceutical allowance;

equals the total amount of pharmaceutical allowance that would have been paid to the person during that year if the person had not received any advance pharmaceutical allowance.

Note 1:       For the amount **_paid_** to a person by way of pharmaceutical allowance see subsections 19A(2) to (7).

Note 2:       The annual limit is affected by:

(a)           how long during the calendar year the person was on pension or benefit; and

(b)           whether the person’s rate of pharmaceutical allowance varies during the calendar year.

VEA payments taken into account

  1068B-E7  In points 1068B-E5 and 1068B-E6:

                    <a name="advanc-pharmaceut-allow"></a>**_advance pharmaceutical allowance_** includes advance pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.

                    <a name="pharmaceut-allow"></a>**_pharmaceutical allowance_** includes pharmaceutical allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.

Amount of pharmaceutical allowance

  1068B-E8  The amount of pharmaceutical allowance is the amount per fortnight worked out using Table E.

#### Module F—Rent assistance

Rent assistance

   1068B-F1  An amount to help cover the cost of rent is to be included in a person’s provisional payment rate in the Method statement in point 1068B-A3 for a period if:

                     (a)  the person’s parenting payment is a benefit PP (partnered); and

                     (b)  the person is not an ineligible homeowner; and

                     (c)  the person is not an aged care resident; and

                     (d)  the person pays, or is liable to pay, rent (other than Government rent) in respect of the period; and

                     (e)  the rent is payable at a rate of more than the rent threshold rate; and

                      (f)  the person is in Australia throughout the period; and

                     (g)  the person’s partner is not receiving a rent increased pension; and

                     (h)  if the person or the person’s partner is receiving family payment in respect of a dependent child who is an FP child—the standard family payment rate of the person or partner does not exceed the minimum family payment rate of the person or partner, as the case may be.

Note 1:       For **_rent_**, **_Government rent_** and **_ineligible homeowner_** see section 13.

Partner with rent increased pension

   1068B-F3  A person has a partner with a **_rent increased pension_**, for the purposes of point 1068B-F1, if:

                     (a)  the partner is living with the person in their home; and

                     (b)  the partner is receiving a social security or service pension; and

                     (c)  the rate of pension is increased to take account of rent.

Factors affecting rate of rent assistance

   1068B-F4  The rate of rent assistance depends on:

                     (a)  the fortnightly rent paid or payable by the person; and

                     (b)  whether or not the person has a partner who has a rent increased benefit.

Partner with rent increased benefit

   1068B-F5  A person’s partner has a **_rent increased benefit_** for the purposes of this Module if:

                     (a)  the partner is living with the person in their home; and

                     (b)  the partner:

                              (i)  is receiving a social security benefit or a youth training allowance whose rate is increased to take account of rent; or

                             (ii)  would be receiving such a benefit but for the application of the income test under Module H of Benefit Rate Calculator A, Module G of the Sickness Allowance Rate Calculator, Module G of Benefit Rate Calculator B or Module D of this Rate Calculator; or

                            (iii)  would be receiving a youth training allowance but for the application of the income test under Module G of Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the _Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973_.

Note:          For the treatment of rent paid by a member of a couple see points 1068B-F8 and 1068B-F9.

Rate of rent assistance

   1068B-F6  The rate of rent assistance per fortnight is worked out using Table F-2\. Work out the person’s family situation and calculate Rate A for the person using the corresponding formula in Column 3\. This will be the person’s rate of rent assistance but only up to the person’s maximum rent assistance rate. The person’s maximum rent assistance rate is Rate B for the person, which is the amount in Column 4 that corresponds to the person’s family situation.

this section applies to the person as if the person had not disposed of the assets.

             (9)  If the sum of the rate of pension PP (single) that would, apart from this subsection, be payable to a person and the annual rate of ordinary income of the person exceeds the maximum payment rate, the rate so payable is to be reduced by the amount per year of the excess.
