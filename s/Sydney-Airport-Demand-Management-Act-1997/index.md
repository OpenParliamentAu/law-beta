##### <a id="4"></a>4  Overview

             (1)  This Act provides for the limitation of * aircraft movements at <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place> (otherwise than during * curfew periods).

             (2)  Part 2 sets the * maximum movement limit, and provides for monitoring of compliance with that limit. The * Slot Management Scheme, which provides for the allocation of slots permitting aircraft movements, is required to be consistent with this limit.

             (3)  Part 3 prohibits, and sets out penalties for, unauthorised * aircraft movements. These are movements that are not authorised by a slot allocated under the * Slot Management Scheme and are not otherwise exempt.

             (4)  Part 4 deals with the contents, development and amendment of the * Slot Management Scheme. It also deals with the powers of the Minister and the * Compliance Committee to give directions or make recommendations in relation to slot allocations.

             (5)  Part 5 deals with the contents, development and amendment of the * Compliance Scheme.

             (6)  Parts 6 and 7 deal, respectively, with the appointment etc. of the * Slot Manager and the * Compliance Committee.

             (7)  Part 8 deals with miscellaneous matters.

             (8)  Schedule 1 contains definitions (see also section 3).

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Consequential amendment of the _Airports Act 1996_

                   The _Airports Act 1996_ is amended as set out in Schedule 2.

##### <a id="5A"></a>5A  Part IIIA of the _Trade Practices Act 1974_ to be subject to this Act

                   Part IIIA of the _Trade Practices Act 1974_ has effect subject to this Act.

## Part 2—The maximum aircraft movement limit at <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename><span class="CharPartText">Sydney</span></st1:placename><span class="CharPartText"> </span><st1:placename><span class="CharPartText">Airport</span></st1:placename></st1:place>

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Maximum movement limit

             (1)  There are to be no more than 80 * aircraft movements at <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place> in any regulated hour. This limit is known as the **_maximum movement limit_**.

Note:          The Minister may determine a lower limit—see section 7.

             (2)  A **_regulated hour_** is a period of 60 minutes starting:

                     (a)  on the hour (being one of the 24 hours of a day); or

                     (b)  at 15 minutes past the hour; or

                     (c)  at 30 minutes past the hour; or

                     (d)  at 45 minutes past the hour.

             (3)  However, a period is not a **_regulated hour_** if it starts during, or less than 60 minutes before, a * curfew period.

Note:          * Aircraft movements during * curfew periods are regulated under the <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>_Sydney_</st1:placename><st1:placename>_Airport_</st1:placename></st1:place>_Curfew Act 1995_.

             (4)  In applying the limit imposed by this section, * aircraft movements that are permitted by Division 5 of Part 3 are not to be counted.

             (5)  The purpose of this section is to set the maximum movement limit for the purposes of the * Slot Management Scheme and other provisions of this Act. It does not operate to create rights or obligations except as provided in other provisions of this Act.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Minister’s power to determine a lower maximum movement limit

             (1)  The Minister may, in writing, determine that subsection 6(1) is to have effect as if a lower number of * aircraft movements were specified in it.

Note:          See section 8 for consultation requirements.

             (2)  A determination under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (3)  While a determination under subsection (1) is in force, subsection 6(1) has effect as if the lower number of * aircraft movements were specified in it.

             (4)  A determination under subsection (1):

                     (a)  comes into force on the first day after the end of the period during which it can be disallowed by a House of the Parliament, or on a later day specified in the determination; and

                     (b)  remains in force until the end of the period (if any) specified in the determination, or until the Minister revokes the determination.

If the determination is disallowed, it does not come into force.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Consultation about determination of lower maximum movement limit

             (1)  Before making a determination under subsection 7(1), the Minister must cause to be published in the _Gazette_ a notice:

                     (a)  stating that the Minister is considering making the determination specified in the notice; and

                     (b)  inviting persons covered by any of the following subparagraphs to give the Minister a written submission about the proposed determination within 30 days after the publication of the notice:

                              (i)  the operator of <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place>;

                             (ii)  a person specified in the regulations for the purposes of this subparagraph, being a person who represents the interests of all of the aircraft operators who use Sydney Airport to operate scheduled air services;

                            (iii)  * Airservices <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>;

                            (iv)  the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

             (2)  If a person gives the Minister a written submission in accordance with the notice, the Minister must have due regard to the submission in making the determination.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not, by implication, limit the matters to which the Minister may have regard.

             (4)  This section does not apply to a determination that the Minister proposes to make if the consultation requirements in Part 3 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 1997_ apply to the making of the determination.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Airservices Australia to monitor compliance with maximum movement limit and to report to Minister

Airservices <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s monitoring role

             (1)  * Airservices Australia is to monitor compliance with the * maximum movement limit, and (subject to subsection (5)) is to give the Minister a written report, within 28 days of the end of each quarter, on the extent of infringements (if any) of the limit in the quarter.

             (2)  A **_quarter_** is a period of 3 months starting on any of the following dates in a year:

                     (a)  1 January;

                     (b)  1 April;

                     (c)  1 July;

                     (d)  1 October.

             (3)  The Minister must cause a copy of each report under subsection (1) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the Minister receives the report.

             (4)  * Airservices <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s obligations under this section are limited to monitoring compliance with the * maximum movement limit and reporting to the Minister on the extent of infringements. This monitoring and reporting role does not authorise or require Airservices <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> to take any action to enforce compliance with the limit.

What happens if this section commences during a quarter

             (5)  If this section commences during a quarter (but not on the first day of the quarter):

                     (a)  no report is to be made at the end of the quarter; but

                     (b)  the report made at the end of the next quarter is also to include the information about infringements that occurred in the previous quarter.

What happens if Airservices <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> ceases to provide air traffic services at <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place>

             (6)  If * Airservices <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> ceases to provide air traffic services at <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place>, this section ceases to apply to Airservices <st1:country-region><st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

             (7)  The Minister may enter into an arrangement with another person who does, or is to, provide air traffic services at Sydney Airport under which the person will perform a monitoring role similar to the role that * Airservices Australia performed under this section. Reports received by the Minister under the arrangement are to be tabled in accordance with the requirements of subsection (3).

## Part 3—Penalties for unauthorised aircraft movements

### Division 1—Situations in which penalties apply

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Aircraft movements to which this Part applies

                   This Part applies to all * aircraft movements at <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place>, other than:

                     (a)  aircraft movements that are permitted by Division 5; and

                     (b)  aircraft movements during * curfew periods.

Note:          * Aircraft movements during * curfew periods are regulated under the <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>_Sydney_</st1:placename><st1:placename>_Airport_</st1:placename></st1:place>_Curfew Act 1995_.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Meaning of _no-slot movement_ and _off-slot movement_

Meaning of **no-slot movement**

             (1)  An * aircraft movement is a **_no-slot movement_** if no slot permitting the movement on the day on which it occurs has been allocated under the * Slot Management Scheme.

Meaning of **off-slot movement**

             (2)  An * aircraft movement is an **_off-slot movement_** (subject to subsection (6)) if:

                     (a)  a slot permitting the movement on the day on which it occurs has been allocated under the * Slot Management Scheme; and

                     (b)  the circumstances in which the movement occurs are such that, according to the provisions of the * Compliance Scheme referred to in subsection 49(1), the movement is an off-slot movement.

Clarification of definitions

             (3)  If a slot permitting an * aircraft movement at a specified time on a specified day has been allocated under the * Slot Management Scheme, but the movement occurs at another time on that day:

                     (a)  the movement is not a no-slot movement; but

                     (b)  depending on the circumstances in which the movement occurs, the movement may be an off-slot movement.

Slot Manager’s power to declare that aircraft movements do not have to be in accordance with allocated slots

             (4)  The * Slot Manager may, in writing, declare, in relation to the whole or a part of a day, that * aircraft movements that occur during the period to which the declaration relates are not required to take place in accordance with their allocated slots.

             (5)  In making a declaration, the * Slot Manager must have regard to the provisions of the * Slot Management Scheme referred to in subsection 35(4).

             (6)  During the period to which a declaration relates, an * aircraft movement that would otherwise be an off-slot movement is taken not to be an off-slot movement.

Note:          The declaration has no effect on the question whether an * aircraft movement is a no-slot movement.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Prohibition on no-slot movements

                   The * operator of an aircraft must not, knowingly or recklessly, allow the aircraft to engage in an * aircraft movement to which this Part applies that is a no-slot movement.

Note:          This is a civil penalty provision—see Divisions 2 and 3 for the consequences of a contravention.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Prohibition on off-slot movements

                   The * operator of an aircraft must not, knowingly or recklessly, allow the aircraft to engage in an * aircraft movement to which this Part applies that is an off-slot movement.

Note:          This is a civil penalty provision—see Divisions 2 and 3 for the consequences of a contravention.

<o:p> </o:p>

### Division 2—Civil penalties

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Pecuniary penalties for contravention of civil penalty provisions

             (1)  If the * Federal Court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that a person (the **_operator_**) has contravened a * civil penalty provision, the Court may order the operator to pay to the * Slot Manager, on behalf of the Commonwealth, such pecuniary penalty in respect of the contravention as the Court determines to be appropriate.

             (2)  In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to the following matters:

                     (a)  the nature and extent of the contravention; and

                     (b)  the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and

                     (c)  the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

                     (d)  whether the operator has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in similar conduct.

The Court may also have regard to any other matters it considers relevant.

             (3)  The pecuniary penalty payable under subsection (1) is not to exceed:

                     (a)  for a contravention of section 12:

                              (i)  if the contravention is by a body corporate—2,000 penalty units; and

                             (ii)  if the contravention is by an individual—400 penalty units; and

                     (b)  for a contravention of section 13:

                              (i)  if the contravention is by a body corporate—1,000 penalty units; and

                             (ii)  if the contravention is by an individual—200 penalty units.

Note:          See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

             (4)  The * Federal Court may make such declarations or orders as it considers appropriate in relation to, or as a result of, the proceedings, including (but not limited to):

                     (a)  a declaration that the operator did not contravene a * civil penalty provision; and

                     (b)  a declaration that an * infringment notice that was issued to the operator should not have been issued to the operator, and is not to be counted as an infringement notice for any purpose; and

                     (c)  an order as to costs.

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Procedural matters

             (1)  The * Slot Manager may, by application, institute proceedings in the * Federal Court for the payment of a pecuniary penalty referred to in section 14.

Note:          An application by the operator under subsection 24(1) has effect as if it were an application by the * Slot Manager under this subsection.

             (2)  The proceedings must be commenced within 6 years after the contravention.

             (3)  In hearing and determining the proceedings, the * Federal Court is to apply the rules of evidence and procedure that it applies in hearing and determining civil matters.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  No criminal proceedings for contravention of civil penalty provision

                   Criminal proceedings do not lie against a person only because the person has contravened a * civil penalty provision.

<o:p> </o:p>

### Division 3—Infringement notices (alternative to proceedings for civil penalty)

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Interpretation

                   In this Division:

                    <a name="civil-contravent"></a>**_civil contravention_** means a contravention of a * civil penalty provision.

                    <a name="civil-prosecut"></a>**_civil prosecution_** means proceedings under Division 2 for the payment of a pecuniary penalty in respect of a civil contravention.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Purpose and effect of this Division

             (1)  The purpose of this Division is to create a system of infringement notices for civil contraventions as an alternative to civil prosecutions.

             (2)  This Division does not:

                     (a)  require an infringement notice to be issued to a person for a civil contravention; or

                     (b)  affect the liability of a person to civil prosecution in respect of a civil contravention if an infringement notice is not issued to the person for the contravention; or

                     (c)  prevent the issue of 2 or more infringement notices to a person for a civil contravention; or

                     (d)  affect the liability of a person to civil prosecution for a civil contravention if the person does not comply with an infringement notice issued for the contravention; or

                     (e)  limit or otherwise affect the pecuniary penalty that may be imposed by a court on a person as a result of a civil prosecution.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Issue of infringement notices

             (1)  If the * Compliance Committee:

                     (a)  reasonably believes that a person has committed a civil contravention; and

                     (b)  considers, having regard to the provisions of the * Compliance Scheme referred to in paragraph 49(2)(a), that it is appropriate to issue an infringement notice;

the Compliance Committee may direct the * Slot Manager to issue an infringement notice to the person for the contravention.

             (2)  The * Slot Manager must issue an infringement notice in accordance with the direction.

Note:          The person may apply to the * Federal Court for a determination of the question whether there has been a civil contravention—see section 24.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Infringement notice penalty

             (1)  The penalty payable under an * infringement notice for a civil contravention is the fine specified in the notice.

             (2)  The fine specified is to be at the rate that, under the provisions of the * Compliance Scheme referred to in subsection 49(3), is the appropriate rate of fine for the contravention.

             (3)  The * Compliance Scheme may specify different rates of fine to be payable according to the number of civil contraventions a person has committed, or has committed in a specified period, and according to whether a person is a body corporate or an individual. These are the only grounds on which the Compliance Scheme may specify different rates of fine as being appropriate.

             (4)  A rate of fine specified in the * Compliance Scheme as being appropriate for a civil contravention by a person must not be more than one-fifth of the maximum pecuniary penalty that the * Federal Court could order the person to pay under Division 2 in respect of that contravention (see subsection 14(3)).

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Infringement notice penalty is payable to the Slot Manager on behalf of Commonwealth

                   The penalty payable under an * infringement notice is payable to the * Slot Manager, on behalf of the Commonwealth.

                     (a)  an extension must not be for longer than 28 days;

                     (b)  only one extension may be given;

                     (c)  an extension may be given before or after the end of the initial time for payment of the penalty.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Contents of infringement notice

                             (ii)  in any other way stated in the notice; and

                     (b)  if the person pays the penalty within 28 days after the day on which the notice is issued, or any longer time allowed in writing by the * Slot Manager, the person will not be liable to a civil prosecution in court for the civil contravention, unless the notice is withdrawn; and

                     (c)  if a civil prosecution is brought against the person for the civil contravention, the person may be ordered to pay a civil penalty up to the appropriate limit specified in subsection 14(3) and may be ordered to pay the costs of the civil prosecution proceedings; and

             (2)  If the operator makes an application under subsection (1):

                     (a)  the application has effect as if it were instead an application made by the * Slot Manager, in accordance with section 15, for the payment of a pecuniary penalty referred to in section 14 in respect of the contravention; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of the resulting proceedings in the * Federal Court under section 14, the Slot Manager is the applicant and the operator is the respondent.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Withdrawal of infringement notice

             (1)  The * Compliance Committee may direct the * Slot Manager to withdraw an * infringement notice that has been issued to a person if the Compliance Committee considers, having regard to the provisions of the * Compliance Scheme referred to in paragraph 49(2)(b), that it is appropriate to withdraw the infringement notice.

             (2)  The * Slot Manager must withdraw the notice in accordance with the direction.

             (3)  If the person has already paid the penalty stated in the notice, the * Slot Manager must refund it.

## Part 4—The Slot Management Scheme

### Division 1—Framework within which Scheme to be developed and to operate

##### <a id="33"></a>33  The Scheme and its basic purpose

             (1)  There is to be a scheme, known as the Slot Management Scheme, for <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place>.

             (2)  The basic purpose of the Scheme is to provide a system for the allocation of permissions for * aircraft movements at <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place>, within the * maximum movement limit.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  The concept of a slot

             (1)  A permission for an * aircraft movement is known as a **_slot_**. A slot allocated under the Slot Management Scheme will permit a specified aircraft movement at a specified time on a specified day.

             (2)  A slot allocated under the Scheme is not transferable (except in accordance with provisions in the Scheme about swapping slots) and does not create rights or obligations that are enforceable against any person.

             (3)  Other laws may impose requirements or restrictions on or in relation to * aircraft movements. The allocation of a slot for an aircraft movement under the Scheme in no way affects the application of such other requirements or restrictions to, or in relation to, the aircraft movement.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Contents of Scheme

             (1)  The Slot Management Scheme must provide a system for the allocation of slots for aircraft movements at <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>Sydney</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airport</st1:placename></st1:place> (other than movements during * curfew periods). In addition to allocation, the Scheme may deal with associated matters such as the variation, suspension, cancellation, surrender or swapping of allocated slots, and the conditions that may be imposed on slots.

          (1A)  The Scheme may deal with the allocation of slots for specified categories of aircraft movements.

             (2)  The Scheme must be consistent with the * maximum movement limit.

             (3)  The Scheme may provide for the authorisation of other persons to exercise powers of the * Slot Manager relating to the allocation of slots, or to slots that have been allocated.

             (4)  The Scheme must set out guidelines relating to the exercise of the * Slot Manager’s power under subsection 11(4) to make declarations that * aircraft movements are not required to take place in accordance with their allocated slots.

             (5)  The Scheme must set out guidelines relating to the exercise of the * Slot Manager’s power under section 31 to grant dispensations including, in particular:

                     (a)  what constitutes exceptional circumstances for the purposes of that section; and

                     (b)  the conditions to which dispensations should be subject.

             (6)  The Scheme may contain a mechanism for the reconsideration of decisions made under the Scheme, or of decisions made by the * Slot Manager for the purposes of this Act.

             (7)  The Scheme may contain other provisions relating to the performance of the * Slot Manager’s functions.

             (8)  The Scheme must be consistent with the additional requirements (if any) specified in the regulations. Any such requirements must be consistent with the * maximum movement limit.

             (9)  The Scheme must be consistent with the additional requirements (if any) specified in determinations in force under section 36.

           (10)  The Scheme must be consistent with any requirements of the <st1:place style="BACKGROUND-POSITION: left bottom; BACKGROUND-IMAGE: url(res://ietag.dll/#34/#1001); BACKGROUND-REPEAT: repeat-x"><st1:placename>_Sydney_</st1:placename><st1:placename>_Airport_</st1:placename></st1:place>_Curfew Act 1995_ that relate to * aircraft movements before or after * curfew periods.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Minister’s power to determine additional requirements

             (1)  The Minister may, in writing, determine additional requirements with which the Slot Management Scheme must be consistent. Any such requirements must be consistent with the * maximum movement limit.

             (2)  Before making a determination under subsection (1), the Minister must consult the * Slot Manager about the proposed determination. This requirement does not apply to the Minister making a determination before the Slot Manager has been appointed.

             (3)  A determination under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Consequence of Scheme not being consistent with section 35

                   Inconsistency with section 35 does not affect the validity of the Slot Management Scheme. However, if the Minister becomes aware that the Scheme is inconsistent with that section, the Minister is to take action under Division 2 to have the Scheme amended, as soon as possible, so that it is consistent with that section.

<o:p> </o:p>
