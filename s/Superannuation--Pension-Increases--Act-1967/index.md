pension, being an increase equal to:

                     (c)  in the case of a widow whose husband elected that section 26 of the _Superannuation Act 1922‑1959_ should not apply to him and did not revoke that election—one‑half of the increase in pension to which her husband would have been entitled under subsection (1) of this section; or

                     (d)  in any other case—five‑eighths of the increase in pension to which her husband would have been entitled under subsection (1) of this section.

             (4)  The increases in pensions provided for by this section do not apply to or in relation to:

                     (a)  a pension that became payable under section 57 of the _Superannuation Act 1922_ or of that Act as amended, not being a pension for which contributions were made to a State Fund as defined by section 101 of the _Superannuation Act 1922‑1967_; or

                     (b)  a pension that became payable under section 53 or section 58 of the _Superannuation Act 1922_ or of that Act as amended.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Payment of pension increases
