             (2)  An international passenger aircraft may take off from, or land at, Sydney Airport between 11 pm and midnight, or may land at Sydney Airport between 5 am and 6 am, if:

                     (a)  the take-off or landing is covered by a timetable approved under the Air Navigation Regulations; and

                     (b)  if the take-off or landing is after the time on the day specified under subsection (3)—the take-off or landing has been approved under subsection (4); and

## Table A

### Application, saving or transitional provisions

_Transport and Regional Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 (No. 143, 2001)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Application of Amendments

             (1)  Each amendment made by this Act applies to acts and omissions that take place after the amendment commences.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, if an act or omission is alleged to have taken place between 2 dates, one before and one on or after the day on which a particular amendment commences, the act or omission is alleged to have taken place before the amendment commences.

* * *

_Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003 (No. 140, 2003)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Transitional provisions

             (1)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament; and

                     (b)  is expressed to require that instrument to be published as a statutory rule under the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_;

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in paragraph 6(b) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this  Act  of the _Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903_.

             (2)  If legislation introduced into the Parliament before the commencing day but commencing on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament; and

                     (b)  is expressed to declare that instrument to be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_;

any instrument so made is taken to be an instrument referred to in subparagraph 6(d)(i) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ despite the repeal by this Act of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (3)  If legislation that is in force immediately before the commencing day or that is introduced into the Parliament before that day but that commences on or after that day:

                     (a)  authorised or authorises an instrument to be made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament that adversely affects the rights of a person, or results in the imposition of liabilities on a person; and

                     (b)  provided or provides that the instrument has effect, to the extent that it adversely affects those rights or results in the imposition of those liabilities, despite subsection 48(2) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, before the date of its notification in the _Gazette_;

that legislation is to be construed, on and after the commencing day or the day of its commencement, whichever last occurs, as if it had provided instead that the instrument, to the extent that it adversely affects those rights or results in the imposition of those liabilities, has effect, despite subsection 12(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_, before its registration under that Act.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  legislation (the **_enabling legislation_**) in force immediately before the commencing day:

                              (i)  authorises the making of an instrument; and

                             (ii)  does not declare such an instrument to be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ but nonetheless makes provision for its disallowance by the application, with or without modification, of the provisions of Part XII of that Act; and
