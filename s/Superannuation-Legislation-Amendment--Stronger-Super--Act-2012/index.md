### Division 1—Data and payment regulations and standards relating to RSAs

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Object of Part

             (1)  The object of this Part is to further the interests of holders of RSAs by improving the productivity of the retirement savings account system.

             (2)  The Part does this by providing for a system of standards relating to payments and information connected with the operation of RSAs.

##### <a id="45A"></a>45A  Alternative constitutional basis

                   Without limiting its effect apart from this section, this Part also has the effect it would have if each reference to an employer were, by express provision, confined to an employer that is a corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies.

##### <a id="45B"></a>45B  Data and payment regulations and standards relating to RSAs

             (1)  The regulations may make provision for and in relation to data and payment matters relating to RSAs, to be complied with by:

                     (a)  RSA providers; and

                     (b)  employers in their dealings with RSA providers.

             (2)  The regulations may prescribe different requirements for different classes of RSA or employer.

             (3)  The Commissioner of Taxation may, by legislative instrument, determine standards (**_data and payment standards relating to RSAs_**) relating to data and payment matters relating to RSAs, applicable to:

                     (a)  RSA providers; and

                     (b)  employers in their dealings with RSAs.

Note:          For variation and revocation, see subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (4)  The data and payment standards relating to RSAs may specify different requirements for different classes of RSA or employer.

             (5)  A **_data and payment matter relating to RSAs_** is a matter relating to the manner in which payments and information of a kind mentioned in subsection (6):

                     (a)  relating to:

                              (i)  a holder of an RSA; or

                             (ii)  an employee for whose benefit a contribution to an RSA is to be made by an employer; and

                     (b)  connected with the operation of the RSA;

are dealt with.

             (6)  The kinds of payments and information are:

                     (a)  transactions, including payments, contributions, roll‑over superannuation benefits (within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_), allocations, transfers and refunds; and

                     (b)  reports; and

                     (c)  records, including registrations; and

                     (d)  unique identifiers for use with such transactions, reports and records; and

                     (e)  any other kind of payment or information that is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph; and

                      (f)  to avoid doubt, any payment or information of a kind mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (e) and made or provided by the Commissioner of Taxation.

Adoption of other instruments

             (7)  The regulations or standards may make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, any matter contained in any other instrument or writing:

                     (a)  as in force or existing at a particular time; or

                     (b)  as in force or existing from time to time.

             (8)  Subsection (7) has effect despite anything in subsection 14(2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

Consultations in preparing data and payment standards relating to RSAs

             (9)  The Commissioner of Taxation must consult with APRA in preparing the data and payment standards relating to RSAs.

Note:          For further consultation requirements, see section 17 of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

           (10)  A failure to comply with subsection (9) does not affect the validity or enforceability of the data and payment standards relating to RSAs.

##### <a id="45C"></a>45C  Relationship between standards and other law

             (1)  A data and payment standard relating to RSAs may elaborate or supplement any aspect of regulations made under this Part.

             (2)  However, a data and payment standard relating to RSAs is of no effect to the extent that it conflicts with this Act or regulations made under this Act.

                     (h)  state that payment of the amount is not an admission of guilt or liability; and

                      (i)  state that the person may apply to the Regulator to have the period in which to pay the amount extended; and

##### <a id="45K"></a>45K  Extension of time to pay amount

             (1)  A person to whom an infringement notice has been given may apply to the Regulator for an extension of the period referred to in paragraph 45J(1)(g).

             (3)  If the Regulator extends that period, a reference in this Division, or in a notice or other instrument under this Division, to the period referred to in paragraph 45J(1)(g) is taken to be a reference to that period so extended.

             (4)  If the Regulator does not extend that period, a reference in this Division, or in a notice or other instrument under this Division, to the period referred to in paragraph 45J(1)(g) is taken to be a reference to the period that ends on the later of the following days:

                     (a)  the day that is the last day of the period referred to in paragraph 45J(1)(g);

                     (b)  the day that is 7 days after the day the person was given notice of the Regulator’s decision not to extend.

             (5)  The Regulator may extend the period more than once under subsection (2).

Withdrawal of notice

             (2)  The Regulator may withdraw an infringement notice given to a person (whether or not the person has made written representations seeking the withdrawal).

             (3)  When deciding whether or not to withdraw an infringement notice (the **_relevant infringement notice_**), the Regulator:

                     (a)  must take into account any written representations seeking the withdrawal that were given by the person to the Regulator; and

                     (b)  may take into account the following:

                              (i)  whether a court has previously imposed a penalty on the person for a contravention of an offence of strict liability in Division 2;

                             (ii)  the circumstances of the alleged contravention;

                            (iii)  whether the person has paid an amount, stated in an earlier infringement notice, for a contravention of an offence of strict liability in Division 2 if the contravention is constituted by conduct that is the same, or substantially the same, as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention in the relevant infringement notice;

                            (iv)  any other matter the Regulator considers relevant.

Notice of withdrawal

             (4)  Notice of the withdrawal of the infringement notice must be given to the person. The withdrawal notice must state:

                     (a)  the Regulator withdraws the infringement notice; and

                     (b)  the person has already paid the amount stated in the notice;

the Commonwealth must refund to the person an amount equal to the amount paid.

##### <a id="45M"></a>45M  Effect of payment of amount

             (1)  If the person to whom an infringement notice for an alleged contravention of a provision is given pays the amount stated in the notice before the end of the period referred to in paragraph 45J(1)(g):

                     (a)  any liability of the person for the alleged contravention is discharged; and

                     (b)  the person may not be prosecuted in a court for the alleged contravention; and

                     (c)  the person is not regarded as having been convicted of the alleged offence; and

                     (d)  the person is not regarded as having admitted guilt or liability for the alleged contravention.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the notice has been withdrawn.

##### <a id="45N"></a>45N  Effect of this Division

                   This Division does not:

                     (b)  affect the liability of a person for an alleged contravention of an offence of strict liability in Division 2 if:

                              (i)  the person does not comply with an infringement notice given to the person for the contravention; or

                             (ii)  an infringement notice is not given to the person for the contravention; or

                            (iii)  an infringement notice is given to the person for the contravention and is subsequently withdrawn; or

                     (c)  prevent the giving of 2 or more infringement notices to a person for an alleged contravention of an offence of strict liability in Division 2; or

                     (d)  limit a court’s discretion to determine the amount of a penalty to be imposed on a person who is found to have contravened an offence of strict liability in Division 2.

### Division 4—Correction and rectification of information
