EXAMPLE OF HOW DEEMED INCOME OF A PERSON WHO IS NOT A MEMBER OF A COUPLE IS WORKED OUT
(using rates in force on 1 July 1996)

_Facts_:

Elaine, a single pensioner, has $36,500 worth of financial assets. $1,500 is in a cheque account not earning any interest. $25,000 is earning 6% in interest and $10,000 is earning 8% in interest. The below threshold rate is 5%. The above threshold rate is 7%.

_Application_: 

Step 1.       Elaine's deposit concession money amounts to $1,500 (see section 1079) which earns no interest. Under this Step, $1,500 is multiplied by 0%, giving a nil amount. 

Step 2.       Elaine's deeming threshold is $30,000 (see subsection 1081(1)). Her deposit concession money totals $1,500\. The difference is $28,500\. 

Step 3.       The amount of $28,500 is multiplied by the below threshold rate (5%):

EXAMPLE OF HOW DEEMED INCOME OF A MEMBER OF A NON-PENSIONER COUPLE IS WORKED  OUT
(using rates in force on 1 July 1996)

_Facts:_

Kerry, who is married and receiving newstart allowance, has $1,200

worth of financial assets. Her spouse, Robert, is not receiving a

pension. Kerry has a cheque account containing $200 on which no

interest is paid. The remaining $1,000 is held in a savings account on

which interest is paid at 3%. The below threshold rate is 5%.

_Application:_

Step 1.       Kerry's deposit concession money amounts to $1,200

(section 1079). Of that amount, $200 earns no interest. The remaining

$1,000 earns interest at less than the below threshold rate. Amounts

are worked out as follows:

•   ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00546/Html/7F2BA68A5A201951CA25706F001BD7C6/$FILE/image007.gif)

Step 2.       As Kerry has no financial assets other than deposit concession money, the result of this Step is a zero remainder. Kerry's deeming threshold is $25,000.

Step 3.       Because of the outcome of Step 2, Steps 3 to 5 have no application, and no income is assessed under those Steps.

Step 6.       The only amount of income worked out is the amount of $30 under Step 1\. Therefore, the ordinary income Kerry is deemed to receive per year from her financial assets is $30.

             (4)  The person is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to receive one fifty-second of the amount calculated under subsection (3) as ordinary income of the person during each week.

                     (c)  the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (b)  the medical condition that wholly, or virtually wholly, causes the person's incapacity for work at the end of the period of 52 weeks referred to in section 525AG is different from, or significantly more serious than, the medical condition because of which the person was exempt, under section 525AC, from the activity test at the beginning of that period of 52 weeks; or

                     (b)  the medical condition that wholly, or virtually wholly, causes the person's incapacity for work at the end of the period of 52 weeks referred to in section 603G is different from, or significantly more serious than, the medical condition because of which the person was exempt, under section 603C, from the activity test at the beginning of that period of 52 weeks; or

Amount of credit

             (2)  The amount of the earnings credit is the amount by which that fortnightly rate of ordinary income is less than that ordinary income free area.

Meaning of fortnightly rate of ordinary income

             (3)  If subsection 1115A(1) applies in relation to the application of an ordinary income test to a person for an earnings credit accounting period, a reference in subsection (1) or (2) to the person's fortnightly rate of ordinary income for the period is taken to be a reference to: 

                     (a)  if the person is a member of a couple and the person's partner is receiving a social security pension—the rate worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00546/Html/7F2BA68A5A201951CA25706F001BD7C6/$FILE/image010.gif)

If social security benefit rate is nil—account not taken to be drawn 

1115C-D2.  If:

                     (a)  because a person earned an amount of money from remunerative work done by the person during an earnings credit accounting period, the person would, apart from this point, be taken under point 1115C-D1 to have drawn an amount on the person's earnings credit account established under section 1115B; and

                     (c)  the person later makes a claim for that pension or benefit; and

                     (d)  the Secretary is satisfied that it is reasonable for this section to apply to the person;

then, despite any other provision of this Act, the person's provisional commencement day in relation to that pension or benefit is the day on which the person made the initial claim.

##### <a id="93"></a>93  Newstart deferment periods to include unserved parts of job search deferment periods 

                   If, immediately before 20 September 1996, under a JSA automatic deferment provision or a JSA discretionary deferment provision, job search allowance was not payable to a person for a period (the **_job search deferment period_**) that did not end until on or after that day, any deferment period that is applicable to the person under the corresponding NS allowance automatic deferment provision or NS allowance discretionary deferment provision, as the case may be, is reduced by a period equal to the part of the job search deferment period that occurred before that day.

##### <a id="94"></a>94  Newstart waiting period for former job search allowees not to extend beyond former job search waiting period

                   If, immediately before 20 September 1996 (the **_commencement day_**), because of the operation of section 534 of this Act as in force immediately before the commencement day, job search allowance was not payable to a person before a day later than the commencement day, section 616 does not preclude payment of newstart allowance to the person on and after that later day.

##### <a id="95"></a>95  Approval of unpaid voluntary work

                   If an approval of an organisation was in force immediately before 20 September 1996 under section 28 of this Act as in force at that time, the approval continues in force as if it were an approval given on that day, for the purposes of section 603AA, of any full-time unpaid voluntary work carried out for that organisation.

Insert in Part 1.3:

##### <a id="38B"></a>38B  Notional continuous period of receipt of income support payments

             (1)  The object of this section is to treat a person in certain circumstances as having received an income support payment in respect of a continuous period even though the person did not actually receive such a payment during a part or parts of the period.

             (2)  A continuous period in respect of which a person has received income support payments can only start on a day on which the person is receiving such a payment and can only end on a day when the person is receiving such a payment, and the following provisions of this section have effect subject to this section.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), in determining the continuous period in respect of which a person has received income support payments, any period of not longer than 6 weeks in respect of which the person did not receive an income support payment is taken to have been a period in respect of which the person received such a payment.

             (4)  If a person is taken, because of subsection (3), to have received income support payments in respect of a continuous period of at least 12 months, then, in determining, as at a time after the end of that period of 12 months, the continuous period in respect of which the person has received income support payments, any period of not longer than 13 weeks in respect of which the person did not receive an income support payment is taken to have been a period in respect of which the person received such a payment.

             (5)  In determining for the purposes of subsection (4) the length of a period in respect of which a person did not receive an income support payment, any part of the period that occurred immediately before the end of the period of 12 months referred to in that subsection is to be taken into account.

                         Example of application of subsection(5)

_Facts:_

John receives an income support payment for 48 weeks. He is then employed for 14 weeks. After the 14 weeks he again begins to receive an income support payment. How does his break in payments affect the calculation of his continuous period of receipt of income support payments?

_Application:_

At the end of the first 4 weeks of John's employment he may be taken, under subsection 38B(3), to have received income support payments for a continuous period of 12 months because no longer than 6 weeks have elapsed since he actually received such a payment.

Therefore, as John may be taken to have accrued 12 months continuous receipt of income support payments, he may have a period, under subsection 38B(4), of not longer than 13 weeks without income support payments and still be taken to be in continuous receipt.

However, under subsection 38B(5), the period of not longer than 13 weeks allowed under subsection 38B(4) must include the period of 4 weeks that occurred immediately before, as well as the 10 weeks immediately after, John was taken to have accrued 12 months duration.

As his total period in which he did not receive income support payments was 14 weeks, it exceeds the 13 weeks allowed under subsection 38B(4). His continuous period in receipt of income support ceased, under subsection 38B(2), on the last day he received payment before he started employment.

A new period of continuous receipt of income support payments will begin when John resumes income support payments after his 14 week break.

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, a person who was receiving an income support payment is taken to have continued to receive the payment in respect of a period if:

                     (a)  for the duration of the period, the person remained qualified to receive the income support payment by the operation of the exercise of the discretion under: 

                              (i)  section 516 of this Act as in force at a time before 20 September 1996; or 

                             (ii)  section 595 of this Act or subsection 68(1) of the _Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973_ (disregard a period of employment);

                            but the person's rate of payment was reduced to nil because of the operation of: 

                            (iii)  section 1067 or 1068 of this Act; or 

                            (iv)  Module G of Schedule 1 to the _Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973_; or

                     (b)  the period was a period of non-payment that was imposed under paragraph 526(1)(j), 608(1)(j) or 771HC(1)(b) on the person in respect of the income support payment other than a period of non-payment imposed because the person was a seasonal worker. 

Note: For **_income support payment_** see subsection 23(1).

             (3)  If the Secretary determines in writing, for the purposes of column 3A or 3B of an item in the Table at the end of subsection (2), a higher amount in substitution for an amount (the existing amount) set out in that column of that item, the higher amount is taken, from and including 1 July 1996, to be substituted for the existing amount. A determination under this subsection is a disallowable instrument.

Note 1:       For **_member of a couple_**, **_partnered (partner getting neither pension nor allowance)_** and **_partnered (partner getting pension or allowance)_** see section 4.

Note 2:       For **_homeowner_** see section 11.

Note 3:       If item 2 applies to a person, the value of all the assets of the person's partner is to be taken as being included in the value of the person's assets (see subsection 660YCK(1))—this is why the assets value limit is so high. If, on the other hand, item 3 applies to a person, the value of the person's assets is only _half_ the combined value of the person's assets and the assets of the person's partner (see subsection 660YCK(2)).

Note 4:       If a mature age allowance is not payable to a person because of the value of the person's assets, the person may be able to take advantage of provisions dealing with financial hardship (see sections 1131 and 1132).

Note 5:       The assets value limits of items 1 and 3 in column 3A and item 3 in column 3B are indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194).

Note 6:       The assets value limit of item 1 in column 3B is adjusted annually (see subsection 1204(1)).

Note 7:       The assets value limits of item 2 are adjusted annually so that they are twice the corresponding item 3 limits (see subsections 1204(2) and (3)).

EXAMPLE OF HOW DEEMED INCOME OF A PERSON WHO IS NOT A MEMBER OF A COUPLE IS WORKED OUT
(using rates in force on 1 July 1996)

_Facts:_

Elaine, a single pensioner, has $36,500 worth of financial assets. $1,500 is in a cheque account not earning any interest. $25,000 is earning 6% in interest and $10,000 is earning 8% in interest. The below threshold rate is 5%. The above threshold rate is 7%.

_Application:_

Step 1        Elaine's deposit concession money amounts to $1,500 (see section 46F) which earns no interest. Under this Step, $1,500 is multiplied by 0%, giving a nil amount.

Step 2.       Elaine's deeming threshold is $30,000 (see subsection 46H(1)). Her deposit concession money totals $1,500\. The difference is

$28,500.

Step 3.       The amount of $28,500 is multiplied by the below threshold rate (5%):
