             (6)  For the purposes of this Act, an incapacity for work, or an impairment, of an employee is taken to have resulted from a disease, or an aggravation of a disease, if, apart from that disease or aggravation, as the case may be:

             (3)  For the purposes of this Act, if an employee who is attending a Seafarers Engagement Centre suffers an injury, the employee’s normal weekly earnings are an amount equal to the amount specified in a certified agreement for the purposes of this subsection.

             (6)  If the amount per week payable to employees in a class to which the employee belonged when the injury happened is later increased or reduced as a result of:

                     (a)  the operation of a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory; or

                     (b)  the making, alteration or operation of an award, determination, collective agreement, pre-reform certified agreement or the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, or the doing of any other act or thing under such a law;

the normal weekly earnings of the employee before the injury, as worked out under the preceding subsections, must be increased or reduced by the same percentage as that by which that amount per week was so increased or reduced, as the case may be.

             (1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken to have been wholly or partly dependent on an employee at the date of the employee’s death if the person would have been so dependent apart from an incapacity of the employee that resulted from an injury.

                     (a)  the employee’s spouse; or

                     (b)  a prescribed child of the employee;

is taken to be a person who was wholly dependent on the employee at that date.

             (4)  In determining, for the purposes of this Act, whether a child is or was dependent on an employee, the following are not to be taken into account:

                     (c)  relationships traced through relationships referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Persons caring for prescribed children
