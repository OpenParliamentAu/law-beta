                   The Tribunal must, in carrying out its functions or exercising its powers under this Act, pursue the objectives of providing mechanisms for:

                     (a)  the conciliation of complaints; and

                     (b)  if a complaint cannot be resolved by conciliation—the review of the decision or conduct to which the complaint relates;

that are fair, economical, informal and quick.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Functions

             (1)  The functions of the Tribunal are:

                     (a)  to inquire into a complaint and to try to resolve it by conciliation; and

##### <a id="14AA"></a>14AA  Complaints may be made about discretionary or non‑discretionary decisions

             (1)  To avoid doubt, a complaint may be made under this Part about a decision whether or not the decision involved the exercise of a discretion.

             (2)  However, a decision that did not involve the exercise of a discretion is taken to have been unfair and unreasonable if the decision was contrary to law.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Complaints about decisions of trustees other than decisions to admit persons to life policy funds

             (1)  This section applies if the trustee of a fund has made a decision (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) in relation to:

                     (b)  a particular beneficiary or a particular former beneficiary of an approved deposit fund.

          (1A)  This section does not apply to a decision of a trustee in respect of which a complaint can be made to the Tribunal under section 14A.

Note:          Although a complaint is about the decision of a trustee, the Tribunal may join an insurer or other person as a party to the complaint (see subsection 18(1)). The Tribunal may then review any decision of a person joined as a party that may be relevant to the complaint.

             (3)  If a person has been given a written notice by the trustee of a fund setting out:

                     (a)  the trustee’s decision in relation to the person’s objection to the payment of a death benefit; and

                     (b)  the claim was not lodged, or is not lodged, with the trustee, within 2 years after the person permanently ceased that employment.

          (6C)  Without limiting the meaning of a decision of a trustee relating to the payment of a disability benefit in any other provision of this Act, that expression means, for the purposes of subsections (6A) and (6B), the original decision of the trustee in relation to the matter.

          (6D)  For the purposes of subsection (6C), if, as a result of a complaint about the original decision of the trustee under arrangements made under section 101 of the Supervision Act, the original decision was confirmed or varied, or another decision was substituted for the original decision:

                     (a)  the decision as so confirmed or varied, or the substituted decision, is taken to be the original decision; and

                     (a)  a complainant makes a complaint; and

                     (b)  the Tribunal is satisfied, either after having communicated with the complainant, or having made reasonable attempts to contact the complainant and having failed to do so, that the complainant does not intend to proceed with the complaint;

the Tribunal must deal with the complaint as if it had been withdrawn by the complainant under section 21.

             (2)  If the Tribunal decides to treat a complaint as withdrawn under subsection (1), the Tribunal must give notice in writing to:

                     (a)  if the Tribunal communicated with the complainant—the complainant; and

                     (b)  the other party, or each of the other parties, to the complaint;

of that decision and the reasons for that decision.

             (3)  The Tribunal may also decide to treat a complaint as if it had been withdrawn under section 21, in the following cases:

                     (a)  if the complaint has been made to the Tribunal and relates to a decision or conduct (other than a decision of a trustee, RSA provider, insurer or other decision maker to pay a disability benefit because of total and permanent disability)—more than 12 months have elapsed since the decision complained of was made or the conduct complained of was undertaken; or

             (4)  If the Tribunal decides to treat a complaint as withdrawn under subsection (3), the Tribunal must give notice in writing of that decision and of the reasons for that decision:

                     (a)  to the complainant; and

                     (b)  to the other party, or each of the other parties, to the complaint.

##### <a id="22A"></a>22A  Tribunal may refer complaint or part complaint to other complaint‑handling body

             (1)  If, in relation to a complaint or a part of a complaint, the Tribunal is satisfied that another body (other than a court) having power to deal with the complaint or that part of the complaint is prescribed for the purpose of this subsection:

                     (a)  subject to section 63, the Tribunal may refer the complaint or that part of the complaint to that body; and

                     (b)  if it does so, must inform the parties to the complaint, in writing, accordingly.

Note:          Under section 63 the consent of the complainant will normally be required before a referral takes place.

             (2)  If the Tribunal refers a complaint or a part of a complaint made to it to another body, the complaint to the Tribunal is treated, on being so referred, as having been withdrawn or as having been withdrawn to the extent that it is so referred.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Right to representation in relation to a complaint

             (1)  If a party to a complaint is a body corporate or unincorporate, the party may be represented by a responsible officer of the body.

                     (a)  a party to a complaint is not a body corporate or unincorporate; and

                     (b)  the Tribunal is satisfied that the party cannot adequately act on his or her own behalf because he or she has a disability;

the party may be represented by an agent.

             (3)  If a party to a complaint is not entitled to be represented under subsection (1) or (2), the party must, unless the Tribunal allows the party to be represented by an agent because the Tribunal considers it necessary in all the circumstances, act on his or her own behalf.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="disabl"></a>**_disability_**, in relation to a person, has the same meaning as in the _Disability Discrimination Act 1992_.
