## Part 4A—Financial supplement for tertiary students

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="12A"></a>12A  Object and explanation of this Part

             (1)  The object of this Part is to enable a tertiary student who is, or except for the ABSTUDY parental income test would be, eligible for certain benefits under the ABSTUDY scheme to obtain a repayable financial supplement by choosing to enter into a contract for that purpose with a financial corporation that participates in the Student Financial Supplement Scheme.

             (2)  The payment of financial supplement will reduce certain other benefits payable to the student under the ABSTUDY scheme. The amount of the supplement that the student is eligible to obtain depends on the total amount of those benefits that the student chooses to receive, and the student may choose to repay some of the benefits, or to receive lower benefits, in order to receive a higher supplement.

             (3)  The student is not liable to pay interest to the financial corporation in respect of financial supplement obtained, but the Commonwealth will, without cost to the student, pay a subsidy to the financial corporation that includes an amount in lieu of interest.

             (4)  However, the amount of the financial supplement that has to be repaid under a contract will be indexed on 1 June in the year next following the year in which the contract is entered into and on 1 June in each subsequent year. The amount by which supplement is increased by indexation is owed by the student to the Commonwealth and not to the financial corporation. The student is entitled, but not required, to make early repayments above a certain amount in respect of the supplement during the period of the contract. There is a discount, worked out under subsection 12ZA(7) or (7A), for repayments made before the end of that period.

             (5)  If financial supplement obtained by a student is not repaid in full before the end of the period of the contract, the obligation to repay the amount of the supplement that is still outstanding is assigned to the Commonwealth and the indexed amount is repayable by the student to the Commonwealth through the taxation system when the student’s income reaches a certain level.

##### <a id="12B"></a>12B  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears, expressions that are defined in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ have the same meanings as in that Act.

             (2)  For the purposes of the application of this Part in relation to a person at a time after the person entered or first entered into a financial supplement contract with a participating corporation, the person is called a **_student_** even though the contract period or any contract period may have ended or the person may have ceased to be a student.

##### <a id="12C"></a>12C  Which students are eligible for financial supplement

             (1)  Subject to subsection (1A), a person is an eligible student for the purposes of this Part in relation to a year or a part of a year if:

                     (a)  the person is undertaking, or proposes to undertake, at an education institution in that year or that part of that year, a prescribed course of study or instruction; and

                     (b)  either of the following subparagraphs applies:

                              (i)  the person qualifies for a prescribed benefit under the ABSTUDY scheme in respect of that year or that part of that year;

                             (ii)  the adjusted parental income in relation to the person in respect of that year or that part of that year is less than such amount as is prescribed by the regulations and, except for the parental income test applicable under the ABSTUDY scheme, the person would have qualified for a prescribed benefit under that scheme in respect of that year or that part of that year.

          (1A)  A person is not an eligible student in relation to a year, or a part of a year, that begins on or after the day on which the _Student Assistance Legislation Amendment Act 2006_ receives the Royal Assent.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person is undertaking a course of study or instruction, or a part of a course of study or instruction, offered by an education institution; and

                     (b)  for the purposes of that course or that part of that course, the person is required or allowed by that institution to attend, and attends, a place other than:

                              (i)  that institution; or

                             (ii)  a place in respect of which a determination under subsection (3) is in force;

the person is, for the purposes of this section, taken to be undertaking that course or that part of that course wholly at that institution.

             (3)  The Minister may determine in writing that subsection (2) does not apply in relation to a place, or a class of place, specified in the determination.

             (4)  A determination under subsection (3) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (5)  If a person is undertaking, or proposes to undertake, by correspondence with an education institution:

                     (a)  a course of study or instruction; or

                     (b)  a part of a course of study or instruction;

                   offered by that education institution, the person is, for the purposes of this section, taken to be undertaking that course, or that part of that course, wholly at that institution.

##### <a id="12D"></a>12D  Agreements between Commonwealth and financial corporations

             (1)  An eligible student may apply for financial supplement only to a financial corporation that has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to pay financial supplement in accordance with this Act.

             (2)  Subject to this section, if the Minister has, whether before or after the commencement of this Part, entered into, on behalf of the Commonwealth, an agreement with a financial corporation for the payment by the corporation, in the year beginning on 1 January 1993 or a subsequent year, of financial supplement to eligible students, the corporation is a participating corporation for the purposes of this Part in respect of that year.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to an agreement unless the agreement:

                     (a)  is expressed to have effect subject to this Act; and

                     (b)  provides for the payment by the Commonwealth to the financial corporation, in respect of each amount of financial supplement paid by the corporation to a student that has not been repaid, or in respect of which the rights of the corporation have been assigned to the Commonwealth, of a subsidy of such amount or amounts, or at such rate or rates, and in respect of such period or periods, as are stated in the agreement.

             (4)  Subject to subsection (5), the parties to an agreement referred to in subsection (2) (or such an agreement as previously amended) may enter into an agreement amending or terminating the first‑mentioned agreement (or that agreement as previously amended).

             (5)  The amendment or termination of an agreement does not affect any financial supplement contract that was in force immediately before the amendment or termination took effect.

             (6)  An agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and a financial corporation as mentioned in this section is not subject to any stamp duty or other tax under a law of a State or Territory.

             (7)  An officer may disclose to a participating corporation any information about a student that is relevant to the exercise or performance by the corporation of any of its rights or obligations in respect of the student under this Part.

             (8)  A participating corporation may disclose to an officer any information about a student that is relevant to the exercise or performance of any rights, powers or obligations conferred or imposed on an officer or on the Commonwealth in respect of the student under this Part.

### Division 2—Applications for financial supplement

##### <a id="12E"></a>12E  Explanation of Division

                   This Division sets out how an eligible student can, if he or she so chooses, obtain financial supplement, the amount of the financial supplement that can be obtained and the effect of payment of the financial supplement on the student’s entitlement to certain other benefits under the ABSTUDY scheme.

##### <a id="12F"></a>12F  Secretary to give student notice of entitlement

             (1)  The Secretary must:

                     (a)  decide whether a person (**_the student_**) who applies for benefits under the AUSTUDY scheme or the ABSTUDY scheme in respect of a year or a part of a year is an eligible student in respect of that year or that part of that year; and

                     (b)  give to the student written notice of the decision stating whether the student is an eligible student in respect of that year or that part of that year and, if so, stating:

                              (i)  the minimum and maximum amounts, as determined under the regulations, of the financial supplement that the student is eligible to obtain; and

                             (ii)  such other information as is required by the regulations to be included in such a notice.

          (1A)  Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a year, or a part of a year, that begins on or after the day on which the _Student Assistance Legislation Amendment Act 2006_ receives the Royal Assent.

             (2)  If the notice under subsection (1) states that the student is an eligible student, the Secretary must give to the student a form of application for the financial supplement approved by the Secretary.

             (3)  At any time, whether before or after the student has lodged an application for the financial supplement with a participating corporation under section 12G, the Secretary may review the decision and must, if the decision is revoked or varied, give to the student:

                     (a)  a notice under paragraph (1)(b) stating that the decision has been revoked or varied and, if the decision has been varied, setting out particulars of the variation; and

                     (b)  if the decision has been varied before the student lodged an application for the financial supplement—a fresh form of application.

             (4)  If a notice is given to the student as mentioned in subsection (3), any notice previously given to the student under paragraph (1)(b) before the decision was reviewed is taken to be revoked and the student is not entitled to use any previous notice in connection with an application for financial supplement under section 12G.

##### <a id="12G"></a>12G  When must a person apply for financial supplement?

             (1)  A person who receives a notice under section 12F stating that the person is an eligible student in respect of a year or part of a year, is entitled to apply for the whole or part of the financial supplement he or she is eligible to obtain in respect of the year or part of the year. To obtain financial supplement, the person must apply in accordance with this section.

             (2)  The person may obtain the financial supplement if the person applies for it while the person is an eligible student in respect of the year or part of the year, as the case requires.

             (3)  The person may also obtain the financial supplement if:

                     (a)  the person was an eligible student during the year or part of the year, as the case requires; and

                     (b)  the person applies for financial supplement before the end of the calendar year in respect of which, or a part of which, the person was eligible for financial supplement; and

                     (c)  in the opinion of the Secretary, the person:

                              (i)  had taken all reasonable steps to apply for the financial supplement while still an eligible student in respect of the year or part of the year and had been prevented from applying during the year or part of the year (as the case requires) only because of circumstances beyond his or her control; and 

                             (ii)  had taken steps to apply for financial supplement in respect of the year or part of the year as soon as practicable after ceasing to be an eligible student.

             (4)  An application for financial supplement must be made by lodging the form of application, duly completed, together with the notice issued under section 12F, at any office of a participating corporation.

             (5)  The Secretary must notify an applicant under subsection (3) and the corporation of a decision made under that subsection in respect of the applicant.

##### <a id="12GA"></a>12GA  Student may give notice to participating corporation to increase or decrease financial supplement

                   At any time after a person applies to a participating corporation for an amount of financial supplement, the person may by written notice to the corporation lodged at any office of the corporation tell the corporation that the person requires:

                     (a)  a specified lesser amount of financial supplement (not being an amount that is less than the total financial supplement already paid to the person); or

                     (b)  a specified greater amount of financial supplement (not being an amount that is greater than the maximum amount of financial supplement that the person is eligible to obtain).

##### <a id="12H"></a>12H  Effect of financial supplement on certain other benefits

             (1)  The payment of financial supplement to a person will, as mentioned in subsection 12A(2), reduce the person’s entitlement to certain other benefits under the ABSTUDY scheme in accordance with subsection (2).

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  apart from this section a person would be entitled to a prescribed benefit under the ABSTUDY scheme in respect of a year or a part of a year; and

                     (b)  an application by the person to a participating corporation for financial supplement in respect of that year or that part of that year is accepted by the corporation in accordance with section 12K;

the benefit referred to in paragraph (a) is reduced by an amount equal to one‑half of the amount of the financial supplement paid to the person.

             (3)  If, apart from this subsection, the amount by which a benefit would be reduced by subsection (2) is an amount of dollars and cents and the cents include a half of one cent, the amount is increased by a half of one cent.

### Division 3—Payment of financial supplement

##### <a id="12J"></a>12J  Explanation of Division

                   This Division sets out the legal relationship between a person who applies for financial supplement and the financial corporation that pays the financial supplement. An application for financial supplement relates only to a year or a part of a year and a separate contract between the person and the corporation therefore arises in respect of each year or part of a year for which an application for financial supplement is made.

##### <a id="12K"></a>12K  Contract between applicant for financial supplement and participating corporation

             (1)  If a person (**_the student_**) who is entitled to do so applies to a participating corporation in accordance with section 12G for the payment of financial supplement in respect of a year or a part of a year, the corporation must, as soon as practicable, accept the application by written notice to the student.

             (2)  The acceptance of the application forms a binding contract in respect of that year or that part of that year between the corporation and the student for the making of a loan by the corporation to the student in accordance with this Division of such amount of financial supplement as the student from time to time requests but not exceeding the maximum amount of financial supplement that the student is from time to time eligible to obtain and for the making, if the student so wishes, of repayments during the contract period in accordance with Division 5 in respect of the amount outstanding from time to time under the contract.

             (3)  Despite subsection (2), any amount paid to the student by the corporation in accordance with advice provided by the Commonwealth is taken to be financial supplement paid under the contract even though the student may not have been eligible to obtain that amount.

             (4)  Subsection (3) does not affect the operation of Division 4.

             (5)  In determining the extent (if any) to which it is liable to make a payment in respect of financial supplement to a student under a financial supplement contract, a participating corporation is entitled to rely on advice provided by the Commonwealth.

             (6)  Subject to this Part, the validity of a financial supplement contract is not affected merely because the student was not an eligible student when the application was accepted or ceases at a later time to be an eligible student.

             (7)  A financial supplement contract is not invalid, and is not voidable, under any other law (whether written or unwritten) in force in a State or Territory.

             (8)  Without limiting the generality of subsection (7), a financial supplement contract is not invalid merely because the student is an undischarged bankrupt when the contract is entered into, and any liability of the student to a participating corporation or the Commonwealth under or because of the contract is enforceable despite the bankruptcy.

##### <a id="12KA"></a>12KA  Cooling off period for financial supplement contract

             (1)  An eligible student under a financial supplement contract has a right to cancel the contract. However, the student may waive the right to cancel the contract (see section 12KB). If the student waives the right to cancel the contract, subsections (2) to (6) do not operate in respect of that contract.

             (2)  To exercise the right to cancel the contract, the student must give to the participating corporation written notice that the student is withdrawing his or her application for financial supplement. The notice may be lodged at any office of the corporation.

             (3)  The student’s right is exercisable at any time within the period of 14 days (the **_cooling off period_**) after the day the corporation accepts the student’s application under subsection 12K(1).

Note:          When the corporation accepts the student’s application a binding contract is formed—see subsection 12K(2).

             (4)  During the cooling off period the corporation must not make a payment to the student under the contract.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the corporation makes a payment to the student under the contract before the end of the cooling off period; or

                     (b)  the corporation makes a payment to the student after the end of the cooling off period and the student has exercised the right to cancel the contract within the cooling off period;

the payment is taken not to be a payment of financial supplement if an amount equal to the payment is repaid by the student to the corporation within 7 days after the day of the payment.

##### <a id="12KB"></a>12KB  Person may waive right to cancel contract

             (1)  An eligible student under a financial supplement contract may waive the right to cancel the contract.

             (2)  To exercise the right of waiver, the student must give to the participating corporation written notice that he or she is waiving the right to cancel the contract immediately after his or her application is accepted by the corporation under subsection 12K(1).

##### <a id="12L"></a>12L  Financial supplement contract exempt from certain laws and taxes

             (1)  A law of a State or Territory relating to the provision of credit or other financial assistance does not apply to a financial supplement contract.

             (2)  An application for the payment of financial supplement, a financial supplement contract, or an act or thing done or transaction entered into under such a contract, is not subject to taxation under any law of a State or Territory.

### Division 4—Payments under financial supplement contract to stop in certain circumstances

##### <a id="12P"></a>12P  Explanation of Division

                   This Division provides for payments in respect of financial supplement to stop if the person in receipt of the financial supplement:

                     (a)  so requests; or

                     (b)  is found to be eligible for a reduced maximum amount of financial supplement and has already been paid that amount; or

                     (c)  ceases to be, or is found never to have been, eligible for financial supplement; or

                     (d)  dies.

##### <a id="12Q"></a>12Q  Payments to stop at request of student

             (1)  A student who is a party to a financial supplement contract with a participating corporation may, by written notice to the corporation lodged at any office of the corporation, tell the corporation that he or she does not require any further payments under the contract after a day stated in the notice.

             (2)  If notice is so given to the corporation:

                     (a)  as from the end of the day stated in the notice, the corporation is discharged from liability to make further payments to the student under the contract; but

                     (b)  if, despite paragraph (a), the corporation makes any payments to the student after that day, any amounts so paid after that day or the end of 4 weeks after the notice was given to the corporation, whichever is the later:

                              (i)  are taken not to be payments of financial supplement made under the contract; and

                             (ii)  are repayable by the student to the corporation; and

                            (iii)  may be recovered by the corporation as a debt due to it by the student.

##### <a id="12QA"></a>12QA  Payments to eligible student to stop if the maximum amount of financial supplement is reduced to less than the amount already paid

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Secretary reviews the decision (the **_original decision_**) made in respect of the student under section 12F; and

                     (b)  the student remains an eligible student in respect of the year or part of the year to which the student’s financial supplement contract relates; and

                     (c)  as a result of the review the Secretary varies the original decision so that the maximum amount (the **_original amount_**) of financial supplement that the student is eligible to obtain under the financial supplement contract is reduced (the **_revised amount_**); and

                     (d)  the revised amount is less than the amount of financial supplement that the student has already been paid under the financial supplement contract;

the Secretary must give written notice to the student and to a participating corporation that must include the following:

                     (e)  the revised amount that the student is eligible to obtain;

                      (f)  the amount of financial supplement paid in excess of the revised amount;

                     (g)  a statement that the corporation must cease paying financial supplement to the student.

             (2)  If notice is given to the corporation under subsection (1), then, unless the decision of the Secretary under subsection (1) is set aside or varied:

                     (a)  as from the time the notice is given to the corporation, the corporation is discharged from liability to make further payments to the student under the contract; and

                     (b)  if, despite paragraph (a), the corporation makes payments to the student after that time, any amounts so paid after the end of 4 weeks after the notice is given to the corporation:

                              (i)  are taken not to be payments of financial supplement; and

                             (ii)  are repayable by the student to the corporation; and

                            (iii)  may be recoverable by the corporation as a debt due to it by the student.

### Division 5—Repayments of financial supplement during contract period

##### <a id="12W"></a>12W  Explanation of Division

                   This Division sets out how a student who is a party to a financial supplement contract (**_the contract_**) with a participating corporation may make repayments of financial supplement before the end of 4 years beginning on 1 June in the year next following the year in which the contract was entered into. Section 12X explains how the amount outstanding at any time under the contract (including the amount attributable to indexation, which is identified by section 12Y) is calculated. Section 12ZA explains how the discount for early repayment is calculated and applied.

##### <a id="12X"></a>12X  Calculation of amount outstanding under financial supplement contract

             (1)  Subject to this section, **_the amount outstanding_** under the contract at any time after the contract was entered into and before 1 June in the year next following the year in respect of which the contract was entered into is the amount worked out in relation to the contract, as at that time, using the formula: 

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image005.gif)

             (2)  In subsection (1):

                    <a name="discount"></a>**_discounts_** means the sum of the discounts under subsection 12ZA(7) to which the student became entitled in respect of the financial supplement before the time mentioned in subsection (1).

             (3)  Subject to the following provisions of this section, at any time during:

                     (a)  the period of 12 months beginning on 1 June in the year next following the year in respect of which a financial supplement contract was entered into; or

                     (b)  any of the following 3 periods of 12 months;

                    <a name="amount-outstanding"></a>**_the amount outstanding_** under the contract is taken to be the amount worked out in relation to the period concerned using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image006.gif)

             (4)  For the purposes of the application of the formula in subsection (3) in relation to a time (**_the relevant time_**) within a period of 12 months beginning on 1 June (**_the relevant 12 months_**):

                    <a name="previou-amount-outstanding"></a>**_previous amount outstanding_** means the amount that was outstanding under the contract immediately before the beginning of the relevant 12 months.

                    <a name="actual-repay"></a>**_actual repayments_** means the sum of the amounts actually repaid in respect of the financial supplement during the relevant 12 months but before the relevant time.

                    <a name="discount"></a>**_discounts_** means the sum of the discounts under subsection 12ZA(7) to which the student became entitled in respect of the financial supplement during the relevant 12 months but before the relevant time.

                    <a name="index-factor"></a>**_indexation factor_** means the number worked out to 3 decimal places in relation to the relevant 12 months using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image007.gif)

                    <a name="later-refer-period"></a>**_later reference period_**means the period of 12 months immediately before the relevant 12 months.

                    <a name="earlier-refer-period"></a>**_earlier reference period_** means the period of 12 months immediately before the later reference period.

             (5)  If an indexation factor worked out under subsection (4) would end with a number greater than 4 if it were worked out to 4 decimal places, the indexation factor is increased by 0.001.

          (5A)  The Minister must cause to be published in the _Gazette_ before each 1 June the indexation factor worked out under subsection (4) (as affected by subsection (5)) in relation to the period of 12 months beginning on that day.

          (5B)  An indexation factor published under subsection 12ZZB(3) before the commencement of this subsection has effect as if it were an indexation factor published under subsection (5A).

             (6)  If, apart from this subsection, an amount worked out under subsection (3) would be an amount of dollars and cents, the amount of the cents is to be disregarded.

             (7)  This section has effect subject to paragraph 12U(2)(c).

##### <a id="12Y"></a>12Y  Indexation amount

                   An indexation amount exists in relation to the contract at a particular time (**_the relevant time_**) if:

                     (a)  subsection 12X(3) applied for the purpose of working out the amount outstanding under the contract at the relevant time; and

                     (b)  the amount outstanding under the contract at the relevant time exceeds the amount worked out using the formula: 

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image002.gif)

and the amount of the excess constitutes the indexation amount in relation to the contract at the relevant time.

##### <a id="12Z"></a>12Z  Notice to student of amount outstanding in respect of financial supplement

                   If an amount is outstanding under the contract on 1 June in the year next following the year in respect of which the contract was entered into or on 1 June in any of the next 3 years, the Secretary must arrange for written notice to be given to the student stating the amount outstanding at that date.

##### <a id="12ZA"></a>12ZA  Rights of student during contract period to make repayments in respect of financial supplement

             (1)  Subject to paragraphs 12QB(2)(d), 12QC(2)(d), 12S(2)(d) and 12U(2)(c), the student is not required during the contract period to make a repayment in respect of the amount outstanding under the contract.

             (2)  Non‑payment by the student of the amount outstanding under the contract does not constitute a default under the contract for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory.

             (3)  Subject to subsection (4), the student may make to the corporation a repayment in respect of the amount outstanding under the contract at any time during the contract period.

             (4)  The student is not entitled to make a repayment under subsection (3) that is less than an amount prescribed by the regulations unless the amount repaid is equal to the amount outstanding under the contract.

             (5)  If the student purports to make a repayment under subsection (3) that exceeds the amount that, having regard to the discount to which the student would be entitled under subsection (7) or (7A) (as the case may be), would be needed to be paid in order to pay in full the amount outstanding under the contract, the excess is taken not to be a repayment in respect of the financial supplement and is to be repaid by the corporation to the student.

             (6)  If the student makes a repayment as mentioned in subsection (3), the following provisions of this section have effect in relation to the amount of that repayment (**_th_****_e amount repaid_**) except:

                     (a)  to the extent (if any) to which that repayment is taken to have been made in or towards repayment of any wrongly paid financial supplement referred to in subsection 12QB(2), 12QC(2) or 12S(2); or

                     (b)  in respect of a repayment made after the giving of a notice under section 12QB, 12QC or 12U.

             (7)  If the student makes a repayment in respect of the amount outstanding under the contract that is less than the amount outstanding under the contract, the student is entitled for the purposes of this Part, in respect of the amount outstanding under the contract, to a discount of an amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image008.gif)

          (7A)  If the student makes a repayment in respect of the amount outstanding under the contract that equals that amount, the student is entitled, for the purposes of this Act, to a discount of an amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image009.gif)

             (8)  If, apart from this subsection, an amount worked out under subsection (7) or (7A) would be an amount of dollars and cents, the amount is to be rounded to the nearest dollar (rounding 50 cents upwards).

             (9)  If no indexation amount existed in relation to the contract immediately before the repayment is made, the student is taken to have repaid to the corporation in respect of the financial supplement an amount (**_the amount notionally repaid_**) equal to the discount.

           (10)  If an indexation amount existed in relation to the contract immediately before the repayment is made:

                     (a)  if the discount is equal to or less than the indexation amount—the amount outstanding under the contract is taken to be reduced by the amount of the discount; or

                     (b)  if the discount exceeds the indexation amount:

                              (i)  the amount outstanding under the contract is taken to be reduced by the indexation amount; and

                             (ii)  the student is taken to have repaid to the corporation in respect of the financial supplement an amount (**_the amount notionally repaid_**) equal to the excess.

           (11)  The Commonwealth is liable to pay to the corporation an amount equal to the amount notionally repaid.

           (12)  If, after the making of the repayment mentioned in subsection (6), the sum of the actual repayments and the notional repayments is equal to or exceeds the principal sum:

                     (a)  the corporation’s rights in respect of the student under the contract are assigned to the Commonwealth by force of this paragraph; and

                     (b)  if the sum of the actual repayments and the notional repayments exceeds the principal sum—the corporation is liable to pay the excess to the Commonwealth.

##### <a id="12ZB"></a>12ZB  What happens at end of contract period

                   At the end of the contract period:

                     (a)  if the corporation’s rights in respect of the student under the contract have not previously been assigned to the Commonwealth, those rights are assigned to the Commonwealth by force of this paragraph; and

                     (b)  if the principal sum exceeds the sum of the actual repayments and the notional repayments, the Commonwealth is liable to pay the excess to the corporation.

##### <a id="12ZC"></a>12ZC  Notice to student

             (1)  The Secretary must, as soon as practicable after the termination date in relation to the contract, arrange for written notice to be given to the student:

                     (a)  stating that at the end of the contract period the student ceased to be indebted to the participating corporation under the contract and will not receive any discount for repayments made after that time; and

                     (b)  stating that on a date specified in the notice, being 1 June immediately following the termination date, the student incurred an FS debt or FS debts to the Commonwealth and setting out the amount of that debt or the amounts of those debts; and

             (3)  A notice given to the student under this section is given for the purpose only of providing information to the student, and an FS debt of the student to the Commonwealth is not affected by a failure to give such a notice or by any incorrect statement in such a notice.

             (1)  If the student considers that the notice given to the student under section 12ZC was not, or has ceased to be, correct in a material particular, the student may, within 14 days after the date on which the notice was given, or within such further period as the Secretary or an officer of the Department allows, give to the Secretary a written request for the notice to be corrected in respect of that particular.

             (2)  A request must set out the particular that is considered to be incorrect and the grounds on which the student considers that particular to be incorrect.

             (3)  The making of a request does not affect an FS debt of the student to the Commonwealth.

                   This Division provides for the recovery through the taxation system of a student’s outstanding indebtedness in respect of financial supplement paid to the student and not repaid before the end of 4 years beginning on 1 June in the year next following the year in which the relevant financial supplement contract was entered into. The Division uses certain technical expressions to define:

                     (a)  a student’s indebtedness in respect of a contract under which the student received financial supplement for a year or a part of a year, which is called an FS debt; and

                     (b)  a student’s total indebtedness under such contracts, which is called accumulated FS debt; and

                     (c)  the amount that a student is assessed by the Commissioner of Taxation to be liable to pay in a particular year of income in respect of that total indebtedness, which is called an FS assessment debt.

##### <a id="12ZF"></a>12ZF  FS debt and accumulated FS debt

             (1)  If, at the end of the contract period in relation to a financial supplement contract between a participating corporation and another person, there was an amount outstanding under the contract, the person incurs on 1 June immediately following the end of that period a debt (**_FS debt_**) to the Commonwealth worked out using the formula:

             (2)  If an FS debt or FS debts of a person that existed on 1 June in a year (**_the relevant date_**) are not, or do not include, an FS debt that existed on 1 June in the immediately preceding year, the person incurs on the relevant date an **_accumulated FS debt_** to the Commonwealth equal to that FS debt or the total of those FS debts.

             (3)  If an FS debt or FS debts of a person that existed on 1 June in a year (**_the later date_**) are, or include, an FS debt or FS debts that existed on 1 June in the immediately preceding year (**_the earlier date_**), the person incurs on the later date an **_accumulated FS debt_** to the Commonwealth worked out using the formula:

                     (b)  was in force immediately before that day;

is taken to be a decision under subsection (1) of this section.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Late payment charge and interest in relation to overpayment of a benefit

             (1)  This section applies if a person has been paid (whether before or after the commencement of this subsection) an amount (the **_recoverable amount_**) that is a special educational assistance scheme overpayment or a student assistance overpayment.

          (1A)  Where the whole or a part of the recoverable amount is due to the Commonwealth, the Secretary may give the person by whom the amount is due a written notice that specifies however much of the recoverable amount as is still due and draws the person’s attention to the terms of subsection (2).

             (2)  If the whole or a part of the recoverable amount is still due to the Commonwealth at the end of 3 months after the notice is given, the person is liable:

                     (a)  to pay to the Commonwealth an additional amount of $100; and

                             (ii)  at the rate ascertained under the regulations;

on so much of the recoverable amount as, from time to time, remains due.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  judgment is given by, or entered in, a court for the payment of:

                              (i)  the whole or a part of the recoverable amount; or

                     (b)  the judgment debt carries interest;

then:

                     (c)  the recoverable amount, or the part of the recoverable amount, as the case may be, does not, for the purposes of subsection (2), stop being due solely because of the giving or entering of the judgment; and

                     (d)  the interest that would, but for this subsection, be payable under this section in relation to the recoverable amount is reduced by:

                              (i)  if subparagraph (a)(i) applies—the amount of the interest on the judgment debt; or

                             (ii)  if subparagraph (a)(ii) applies—the amount worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image014.gif)

             (4)  Any amount paid to the Commonwealth by or under the authority of the person in relation to the recoverable amount is:

                     (b)  to be taken secondly to reduce any interest payable under paragraph (2)(b).

             (5)  Interest is not payable under this section in relation to the recoverable amount in relation to any period during which a decision under section 39A is in force in relation to the recoverable amount unless the decision provides that interest is to be so payable or an instalment is not paid in accordance with the decision.

             (6)  If a person has unsatisfied liabilities to the Commonwealth in relation to more than one student assistance overpayment or special educational assistance scheme overpayment, the Secretary may, for the purposes of subsection (1), treat the overpayments as if they were a single amount.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Determination that late payment interest not to be payable in relation to certain periods

             (1)  The Secretary may, in writing, determine that:

                     (a)  an additional amount otherwise payable by a person under paragraph 40(2)(a); or

                     (b)  interest otherwise payable by a person in respect of a certain period under paragraph 40(2)(b);

is not payable.

             (3)  A determination may be expressed to be subject to the person complying with specified conditions.

             (4)  The Secretary must give a copy of the determination to the person as soon as practicable after making a determination.

             (5)  Contravention of subsection (4) does not invalidate a determination.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  a determination is expressed to be subject to the person complying with specified conditions; and

                     (b)  the person contravenes a condition;

the determination ceases to have effect.

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Recovery of certain overpayments from third parties

             (2)  This section applies where:

                     (a)  the liability of a person (in this section called the **_debtor_**) to the Commonwealth in relation to a debt has not been fully satisfied; and

                     (b)  there is another person (in this section called the **_third party_**):

                              (i)  by whom any money is due, or may become due, to the debtor; or

                             (ii)  who holds, or may subsequently hold, money for the debtor; or

                            (iii)  who holds, or may subsequently hold, money for some other person for payment to the debtor; or

                            (iv)  who has authority from some other person to pay money to the debtor.

          (2A)  The first reference in paragraph (2)(b) to another person includes a reference to:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth; and

                     (b)  a State; and

                     (c)  a Territory; and

                     (d)  any authority of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory.

             (3)  The Secretary may, by written notice given to the third party, require the third party to pay to the Commonwealth:

                     (a)  a specified amount, not being an amount more than:

                              (i)  the amount then due to the Commonwealth in relation to the debt; or

                             (ii)  the amount of the money referred to in whichever of the subparagraphs of paragraph (2)(b) is applicable; or

                     (b)  a specified amount out of each payment that the third party becomes liable from time to time to make to the debtor until the total of the amounts paid to the Commonwealth under the notice equals the amount then due to the Commonwealth in relation to the debt.

             (4)  A payment required to be made by the notice is to be made within the time specified in the notice, not being a time earlier than:

                     (a)  the money concerned becomes due or is held; or

                     (b)  14 days after the notice is given.

             (5)  The third party must not contravene the notice.

                    Penalty:  Imprisonment for 1 year.

          (5A)  Subsection (5) does not apply if the party has a reasonable excuse.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5A) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (6)  The Secretary must give a copy of the notice to the debtor.

             (7)  Contravention of subsection (6) does not invalidate the notice.

             (8)  If the third party makes a payment to the Commonwealth under the notice, the payment is to be taken to have been made with the authority of the debtor and of any other person concerned.

             (9)  If the whole or a part of the debt stops being due to the Commonwealth otherwise than because of a payment made by the third party, the following provisions have effect:

                     (a)  the Secretary must notify the third party of the amount that has stopped being due;

                     (b)  if paragraph (3)(a) applies to the notice—the amount specified in the notice is to be taken to be reduced, or further reduced, as the case requires, by the amount that has stopped being due;

                     (c)  if paragraph (3)(b) applies to the notice—the reference in that paragraph to the total of the amounts paid to the Commonwealth under the notice is to be taken to be a reference to that total as increased, or further increased, as the case requires, by the amount that has stopped being due.

           (10)  If the third party, without reasonable excuse, contravenes the notice, an amount equal to:

                     (a)  so much (if any) of the amount required by the notice to be paid by the third party as the third party was able to pay to the Commonwealth but did not pay; or

                     (b)  so much of the debt as remains due to the Commonwealth from time to time;

whichever is the lesser, is a debt due by the third party to the Commonwealth.

           (11)  If:

                     (a)  the third party is indebted to the Commonwealth under subsection (10); and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth recovers the whole or a part of the third party’s debt;

the debtor’s liability to the Commonwealth in relation to the debt referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is reduced or further reduced, as the case requires, by the amount recovered from the third party.

           (12)  If, apart from this section, money is not due or payable on demand by the third party unless a condition is fulfilled, the money is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to be due or payable on demand, whether or not the condition has been fulfilled.

           (13)  If a person has unsatisfied liabilities to the Commonwealth in relation to more than one debt, the Secretary may:

                     (a)  for the purposes of this section, treat the debts as a single debt; but

                     (b)  apportion any amount recovered under this section in relation to the debts in such proportion as the Secretary considers appropriate.

           (14)  An apportionment made by the Secretary under subsection (13) must be made in writing.

##### <a id="42A"></a>42A  Recovery of amounts from financial institutions

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an amount or amounts of student assistance benefit are paid to a financial institution for the credit of an account kept with the institution; and

                     (b)  the Secretary is satisfied that the amount or the amounts were intended to be paid for the benefit of someone who was not the person or one of the persons in whose name or names the account was kept;

the Secretary may give a written notice to the institution setting out the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) and requiring the institution to pay to the Commonwealth, within a period (being a reasonable period) stated in the notice, the lesser of the following amounts:

                     (c)  an amount specified in the notice, being the amount, or the sum of the amounts, of the student assistance benefit;

                     (d)  the amount standing to the credit of the account when the notice is received by the institution.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  an amount or amounts of student assistance benefit that are intended for the benefit of a person are paid to a financial institution for the credit of an account that was kept with the institution by the person or by the person and one or more other persons; and

                     (b)  the person died before the amount or amounts were paid;

the Secretary may give a written notice to the institution setting out the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) and requiring the institution to pay to the Commonwealth, within a period (being a reasonable period) stated in the notice, the lesser of the following amounts:

                     (c)  an amount specified in the notice, being the amount, or the sum of the amounts, of the student assistance benefit;

                     (d)  the amount standing to the credit of the account when the notice is received by the institution.

                     (a)  the amount sought to be recovered from the deceased person’s account; and

                     (b)  the reasons for the recovery action.

             (4)  A financial institution must comply with a notice given to it under subsection (1) or (2).

                    Penalty:  300 penalty units.

             (5)  It is a defence to a prosecution of a financial institution for failing to comply with a notice given to it under subsection (1) or (2) if the financial institution proves that it was incapable of complying with the notice.

Note:          The defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5). See section 13.4 of the _Criminal Code_.

             (6)  If a notice is given to a financial institution under:

                     (a)  subsection (1) (amount paid to wrong account) in respect of an amount or amounts of student assistance benefit; or

                     (b)  subsection (2) (death of person in whose name the account was kept) in respect of an amount or amounts of student assistance benefit;

any amount recovered by the Commonwealth from the institution in respect of the debt reduces any debt owed to the Commonwealth by any other person in respect of the amount or amounts of student assistance benefit.

### Division 3—Non‑recovery of debts

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Secretary may write off debt

Writing off debt

             (1)  The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, write off a debt.

Class of debts

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the Secretary may write off debts that are included in a class of debts determined by the Minister by notice published in the _Gazette_.

When decision takes effect

             (3)  A decision made under subsection (1) takes effect:

                     (a)  if a day is stated in the decision as the day on which the decision takes effect—on the day so stated (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the decision is made); or

                     (b)  if a day is not so stated in the decision—on the day on which the decision is made.

Note:          If the Secretary writes off a debt, this means an administrative decision has been made that, in the present circumstances, there is no point in trying to recover the debt. In law, however, this debt still exists and may later be pursued.

##### <a id="43A"></a>43A  Power to waive Commonwealth’s right to recover debt

Secretary’s limited power to waive

             (1)  The Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, waive the Commonwealth’s right to recover the whole or a part of a debt only in the circumstances described in section 43B, 43C, 43D, 43E or 43F.

When waiver takes effect

             (2)  A waiver takes effect:

                     (a)  if a day is stated in the waiver as the day on which the waiver takes effect—on the day so stated (whether that day is before, on or after the day on which the decision to waive is made); or

                     (b)  if a day is not so stated in the waiver—on the day on which the decision to waive is made.

Note:          If the Secretary waives the Commonwealth’s right to recover all or part of a debt, the waiver is a permanent bar to recovery of that debt or that part of the debt—that debt or that part of the debt effectively ceases to exist.

##### <a id="43B"></a>43B  Waiver of debt arising from error

Administrative error

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of a debt that is attributable solely to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth if the debtor received in good faith the payment or payments that gave rise to that proportion of the debt.

Note:          Subsection (1) does not allow waiver of part of a debt that was caused partly by administrative error and partly by one or more other factors (such as error by the debtor).

Circumstances under which subsection (1) applies

             (2)  Subsection (1) only applies if:

                     (a)  the debt is not raised within a period of 6 weeks from the first payment that caused the debt; or

                     (b)  if the debt arose because a person has complied with an obligation to provide information or documents to the Department under this Act, the debt is not raised within a period of 6 weeks from the end of the period within which the person was required to comply with that obligation;

whichever is the later.

Underestimating value of property

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a debt arose because the debtor, the debtor’s partner, or the debtor’s parent or parents underestimated the value of particular property; and

                     (b)  the estimate was made in good faith; and

                     (c)  the value of the property was not able to be easily determined when the estimate was made;

the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of the debt attributable to the underestimate.

Proportion of a debt

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, a proportion of a debt may be 100% of the debt.

             (5)  In this section:

                    <a name="child"></a><a name="child"></a>**_child_**: without limiting who is a child of a person for the purposes of this section, someone is the **_child_** of a person if he or she is a child of the person within the meaning of the _Family Law Act 1975_.

                    <a name="parent"></a>**_parent_**, in relation to a person, means:

                     (a)  if the person is not an adopted child—a natural parent of the person or someone of whom the person is a child because of the definition of **_child_** in this section; or

                     (b)  if the person is an adopted child—an adoptive parent of the person.

                    <a name="partner"></a>**_partner_** has the same meaning as in the _Social Security Act 1991_.

##### <a id="43C"></a>43C  Waiver of debt relating to an offence

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a debtor has been convicted of an offence that gave rise to a proportion of a debt; and

                     (b)  the court indicated in sentencing the debtor that it imposed a longer custodial sentence on the debtor because he or she was unable or unwilling to pay the debt;

the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of the debt.

             (2)  For the purposes of this section, a proportion of a debt may be 100% of the debt.

##### <a id="43D"></a>43D  Waiver of small debt

                   The Secretary must waive the right to recover a debt if:

                     (a)  the debt is, or is likely to be, less than $50; and

                     (b)  it is not cost effective for the Commonwealth to take action to recover the debt.

##### <a id="43E"></a>43E  Waiver in relation to settlements

Settlement of civil action

             (1)  If the Commonwealth has agreed to settle a civil action against a debtor for recovery of a debt for less than the full amount of the debt, the Secretary must waive the right to recover the difference between the debt and the amount that is the subject of the settlement.

Settlement of proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

             (2)  If the Secretary has agreed to settle proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal relating to recovery of a debt on the basis that the debtor will pay less than the full amount of the debt, the Secretary must waive the right to recover the difference between the debt and the amount that is the subject of the settlement.

Waiver where at least 80% of debt recovered and debtor cannot pay more

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the Commonwealth has recovered at least 80% of the original value of a debt from a debtor; and

                     (b)  the Commonwealth and the debtor agree that the recovery is in full satisfaction of the whole of the debt; and

                     (c)  the debtor cannot repay a greater proportion of the debt;

the Secretary must waive the right to recover the remaining 20% or less of the value of the original debt.

Agreement for part‑payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

             (4)  If the Secretary and a debtor agree that the debtor’s debt will be fully satisfied if the debtor pays the Commonwealth an agreed amount less than the amount of the debt outstanding at the time of the agreement (the **_unpaid amount_**), the Secretary must waive the right to recover the difference between the unpaid amount and the agreed amount.

Limits on agreement to accept part‑payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

             (5)  The Secretary must not make an agreement described in subsection (4) unless the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the debtor cannot repay more of the debt than the agreed amount; and

                     (b)  the agreed amount is at least the present value of the unpaid amount repaid in instalments whose amount and timing are determined by the Secretary; and

                     (c)  it would take at least 12 months to recover the unpaid amount under this Part if subsection (4) did not apply.

Formula for working out present value of unpaid amount

             (6)  For the purposes of subsection (5), the **_present value of the unpaid amount_** is the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image015.gif)

where:

                    <a name="annual-repay"></a>**_annual repayment_** is the amount of the debt that the Secretary believes would be recovered under this Part in a year if subsection (4) did not apply in relation to the debt.

                    <a name="interest"></a>**_interest_** is the annual rate of interest specified by the Minister in a written notice.

                    <a name="repay-period"></a>**_repayment period_** is the number of years needed to repay the unpaid amount if repayments equal to the annual repayment were made each year.

Example:    

Facts:         Terry owed a debt of $8,000 to the Commonwealth. He has repaid $2,000 with the remaining debt being $6,000.

                   Terry, with the assistance of his mother, offers to make a single payment of $4,700 in full satisfaction, leaving $1,300 of the debt unpaid. Without Terry’s mother’s assistance, Terry can only pay fortnightly instalments amounting to $1,200 a year and, at that rate, would take 5 years to pay the remaining $6,000.

                   Assume that the Minister has specified an interest rate of 10%.

Result:        The present value of the unpaid amount of $6,000 to be repaid in 5 years at a 10% interest rate is worked out as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00587/Html/f71e4329-304c-4c99-95d4-a39ba46f5fd7_files/image016.gif)

                   As the proposed payment of $4,700 is more than the present value of the unpaid amount (which is $4,548 as shown), and as the other conditions in subsection (5) apply, the Secretary may accept Terry’s offer and make an agreement with him as described in subsection (4).

                   If the Secretary makes the agreement, the Secretary must, in accordance with subsection (4), waive the remaining $1,300 of the debt (being the difference between the unpaid amount of $6,000 and the agreed amount of $4,700).

Notice is a disallowable instrument

             (7)  A notice described in the definition of **_interest_** in subsection (6) is a disallowable instrument for the purpose of section 46A of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

##### <a id="43F"></a>43F  Waiver in special circumstances

                   The Secretary may waive the right to recover all or part of a debt if the Secretary is satisfied that:

                     (a)  the debt did not result wholly or partly from the debtor or another person knowingly:

                              (i)  making a false statement or a false representation; or

                             (ii)  failing or omitting to comply with a provision of this Act; and

                     (b)  there are special circumstances (other than financial hardship alone) that make it desirable to waive; and

                     (c)  it is more appropriate to waive than to write off the debt or part of the debt.

Note:          Section 43 allows the Secretary to write off a debt on behalf of the Commonwealth.

             (5)  Subject to subsection (6), a person is taken, for the purposes of the ABSTUDY scheme, to have given his or her tax file number to the Secretary if he or she has lodged an application for a tax file number with the Department.

             (6)  If the Commissioner for Taxation refuses to issue a tax file number to a person who has lodged an application with the Department under subsection (5), subsection (5) is taken not to have applied to that person in relation to that application.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (1A) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_).

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), a certificate by the Secretary stating that a specified amount is the amount paid to a specified person under this Act, or a current special educational assistance scheme, as a result of a specified act, failure or omission is _prima facie_ evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.

                   The _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies to an application under section 324 for review of a decision as if references in section 28 of that Act to the person who made the decision were references to the National Convener.

Note:          Section 1281 of the Social Security Act requires the SSAT to give the parties to a review copies of a statement setting out reasons, findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which the findings were based. Section 28 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ entitles an applicant for review by the AAT to ask the person who made the decision for a statement setting out the same matters. Subsection 28(4) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ provides that an applicant for review is not entitled to a statement under that section if the matters referred to in section 1281 of the Social Security Act are set out in the decision itself or in a written statement given to the applicant.

##### <a id="329"></a>329  Notice of application for review

                   The _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies to an application under section 324 for review of a decision as if the reference in subsection 29(11) of that Act to the person who made the decision were a reference to each party to a review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (other than a party making the application under section 324).

Note:          Subsection 29(11) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires notice of an application to the AAT for review of a decision to be given to the person who made the decision. The effect of this section is that any person who was a party to the review by the SSAT will be given notice of an application to the AAT for further review.

##### <a id="330"></a>330  Parties to review by the AAT

                   The _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies to an application for review under section 324 as if the reference in paragraph 30(1)(b) of that Act to the person who made the decision were a reference to each person who was a party to the review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.

Note:          Paragraph 30(1)(b) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ provides that the person who made the decision under review is a party to the proceeding before the AAT for review of the decision. The effect of this section is that each person who was a party to the review by the SSAT is automatically made a party to an application to the AAT for further review.

##### <a id="331"></a>331  Lodging documents with the AAT

Certain references in the AAT Act taken to be references to a Secretary

             (1)  The _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies to an application for review under section 324 as if references in section 37 of that Act to the person who made the decision that is the subject of an application for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal were references to the Secretary.

Compliance with obligations under paragraph 37(1)(a) of AAT Act

             (2)  If a person applies to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under section 324 for a review of a decision, the Secretary is taken to have complied with his or her obligations under paragraph 37(1)(a) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ in relation to the decision if he or she gives the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the prescribed number of copies of the statement prepared by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal under paragraph 1281(1)(a) of the Social Security Act.

Powers under section 38 of AAT Act

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not limit the Administrative Appeals Tribunal’s powers under section 38 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.

Note 1:       Subsection 37(1) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ requires a person who has made a decision that is under review by the AAT to give the AAT copies of: 

(a)     a statement setting out the findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based and giving the reasons for the decision; and 

(b)    every other document or part of a document that is in the person’s possession or under the person’s control and is considered by the person to be relevant to the review.

                   Unless subsection 331(1) provided otherwise, the obligations under section 37 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ would fall on the SSAT. Paragraph 1281(1)(a) of the Social Security Act requires the SSAT to prepare a written statement of reasons, findings and evidence for its decision and paragraph 1281(1)(b) of that Act requires the SSAT to give the Secretary, or the Secretary to the Department of Social Security, a copy of the statement. As the Secretary, or the Secretary to the Department of Social Security, as the case requires, has possession of the statement and relevant documents, he or she is the appropriate person to give them to the AAT.

Note 2:       Section 38 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ allows the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to order the person who lodged a statement under paragraph 37(1)(a) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, to lodge an additional statement containing further and better particulars.

##### <a id="332"></a>332  Power of the AAT to obtain additional statements

                   The _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies to an application for review under section 333 as if references in section 38 of that Act to the person who lodges a statement referred to in paragraph 37(1)(a) of that Act with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal were references to the National Convener.

Note:          The effect of this section is that if the AAT considers that the statement under section 1281 of the Social Security Act is not adequate, the AAT may ask the National Convener to provide an additional statement containing further and better details.

##### <a id="333"></a>333  Operation and implementation of the decision under review

Applications for review by AAT

             (1)  The _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies to an application for review under section 324 as if the references in subsection 41(4) of that Act to the person who made the decision were references to each party to the review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the **_SSAT_**).

Note:          Section 41 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ deals with the operation and implementation of a decision under review by the AAT.

Review of decisions

             (2)  The _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies to an application for review under section 324 as if the references in section 41 of that Act to the decision to which the relevant proceeding relates were references to:

                     (a)  if the SSAT affirmed the original decision—the original decision; or

                     (b)  if the SSAT varied the original decision:

                              (i)  the original decision as varied by the SSAT; and

                             (ii)  the original decision; or

                              (i)  the new decision; and

                             (ii)  the original decision; or

                     (d)  if the SSAT set aside the original decision and sent the matter back to the Secretary for reconsideration in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the SSAT:

                              (i)  any decision made as a result of that reconsideration; and

                             (ii)  the original decision.

Review by SSAT

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), the original decision is the decision that was reviewed by the SSAT.

##### <a id="334"></a>334  Power of the AAT if party fails to appear

                   The _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies to a review under section 324 as if the reference in subsection 42A(2) of that Act to the person who made the decision were references to the Secretary.

Note:          Subsection 42A(2) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ empowers the AAT to direct that, if a person fails to appear (other than the person who made the decision that is under review), that person is to cease to be a party to the proceedings before the AAT or the application for review is to be dismissed.

_Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (No. 8, 2005)_

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Saving of matters in Part 2 of Schedule 1

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a decision or action is taken or another thing is made, given or done; and

                     (b)  the thing is taken, made, given or done under a provision of a Part 2 Act that had effect immediately before the commencement of this Act;

then the thing has the corresponding effect, for the purposes of the Part 2 Act as amended by this Act, as if it had been taken, made, given or done under the Part 2 Act as so amended.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
