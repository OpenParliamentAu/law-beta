                     (a)  the asset is acquired:

                              (i)  for the benefit of a particular member of the acquiring fund; and

                             (ii)  from a trustee or investment manager of another regulated superannuation fund (the **_transferring fund_**); and

                     (b)  at the time of the acquisition:

                             (ii)  the member’s entitlements as determined under Part VIIIB of the _Family Law Act 1975_ in relation to the interests of the member’s spouse, or former spouse, in the transferring fund.

          (2C)  For the purposes of subsection (2B), the question whether the spouses, or former spouses, have separated is to be determined in the same way as it is for the purposes of section 48 of the _Family Law Act 1975_ (as affected by sections 49 and 50 of that Act).

## 3  After section 71E

Insert:

##### <a id="71EA"></a>71EA  Relationship breakdowns

Scope

             (1)  This section applies if:

                              (i)  for the benefit of a particular member of the acquiring fund; and

                             (ii)  from a trustee or investment manager of another regulated superannuation fund (the **_transferring fund_**); and

                     (b)  at the time of the acquisition:

                              (i)  the member and his or her spouse or former spouse are separated; and

                             (ii)  there is no reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed; and

                              (i)  the member’s own interests in the transferring fund; or

                             (ii)  the member’s entitlements as determined under Part VIIIB of the _Family Law Act 1975_ in relation to the interests of the member’s spouse, or former spouse, in the transferring fund.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the question whether the spouses, or former spouses, have separated is to be determined in the same way as it is for the purposes of section 48 of the _Family Law Act 1975_ (as affected by sections 49 and 50 of that Act).

Acquiring fund taken to have always held asset

             (3)  For the purposes of applying this Subdivision to the asset at or after the time (the **_acquisition time_**) the trustee or investment manager of the acquiring fund acquires the asset, treat:

                     (a)  the acquisition as having occurred at the time the trustee or investment manager of the transferring fund acquired the asset; and

                     (b)  anything done by, for or in relation to the transferring fund in relation to the asset before the acquisition time as having been done by, for or in relation to the acquiring fund; and

Note:          This means that the trustees of both the transferring fund and the acquiring fund must retain, in accordance with subsection 103(2A), any election made under section 71E in relation to the transferring fund before the transfer of the asset.

             (5)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person is a trustee of the transferring fund; and

                     (b)  just before the acquisition time, the trustee had a duty under subsection 103(2A) to retain an election, or a copy of an election, under section 71E in relation to the transferring fund; and

                     (c)  the trustee does not, within 14 days after the acquisition time, give the election or copy to a trustee or investment manager of the acquiring fund.

                    Penalty:  50 penalty units.

Note:          If the trustee gives the election to the acquiring fund, he or she must retain a copy of the election: see subsection (4).

             (6)  An offence against subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.
