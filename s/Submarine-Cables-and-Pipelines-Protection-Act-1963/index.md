An Act relating to the Protection of Submarine Cables and Pipelines beneath the High Seas
Preamble
WHEREAS a Convention entitled “Convention on the High Seas” was signed at Geneva on the twenty‑ninth day of April, One thousand nine hundred and fifty‑eight: 
	AND WHEREAS, in accordance with Article 34 of the Convention, the Convention entered into force in relation to the Commonwealth on the thirteenth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and sixty‑three: 
	AND WHEREAS Articles 27, 28 and 29 of the Convention read as follows: 
	“Article 27
		“Every State shall take the necessary legislative measures to provide that the breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction of a submarine cable beneath the high seas done wilfully or through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications, and similarly the breaking or injury of a submarine pipeline or high‑voltage power cable shall be a punishable offence. This provision shall not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury.
	“Article 28
		“Every State shall take the necessary legislative measures to provide that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a cable or pipeline beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable or pipeline, cause a break in or injury to another cable or pipeline, they shall bear the cost of the repairs.
	“Article 29
		“Every State shall take the necessary legislative measures to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable or pipeline, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable or pipeline, provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand.’’: 
	AND WHEREAS Article 1 of the Convention reads as follows: 
	“Article 1
		“The term ‘high seas’ means all parts of the sea that are not included in the territorial sea or in the internal waters of a State.”: 
	AND WHEREAS it is desirable that the Commonwealth should give effect to Articles 27, 28 and 29 of the Convention: 
	BE it therefore enacted by the Queen’s Most Excellent Majesty, the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, as follows: 
1  Short title [see Note 1]
		This Act may be cited as the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1963.
2   Commencement [see Note 1]
		This Act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.
3  Saving of other laws
	(1)	This Act shall be read and construed as being in addition to and not in derogation of or in substitution for any other law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. 
	(2)	The reference in the last preceding subsection to a law of the Commonwealth includes a reference to the Imperial Act known as the Submarine Telegraph Act, 1885, insofar as that Act is part of the law of the Commonwealth. 
4  Extension of Act to Territories
		This Act extends to all the Territories. 
5  Act applies only to cables and pipelines beneath the high seas

Penalty:	Where the person acted wilfully, Two thousand dollars or imprisonment for one year; in any other case, One thousand dollars or imprisonment for three months. 
	(2)	Where:
	(a)	a breakage of, or an injury to, a cable or pipeline is caused by persons acting with the sole object of saving their lives or their ships; and
	(b)	those persons took all necessary precautions to avoid breaking or injuring the cable or pipeline,
the last preceding subsection does not apply in relation to the break or injury. 
8  Liability for breaking or injuring a cable or pipeline
		If a person, in the course of laying or repairing a submarine cable or pipeline of which he is the owner, causes a break in or injury to another cable or pipeline, he is liable to bear the cost of repairing the break or injury. 
9  Indemnity for loss of anchor etc
		If, after all reasonable precautionary measures have been taken, an anchor, a net or any other fishing gear belonging to a ship is sacrificed in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable or pipeline, the owner of the ship is entitled to be indemnified for his loss by the owner of the cable or pipeline. 
10  Punishment of offences

	(3)	The jurisdiction invested in, or conferred on, a court of summary jurisdiction by this section shall not be judicially exercised except by a Chief, Police, Stipendiary, Resident or Special Magistrate.
