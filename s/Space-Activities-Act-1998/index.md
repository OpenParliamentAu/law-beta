             (3)  A space licence may be revoked or varied even while it is suspended.

##### <a id="25A"></a>25A  Annual review of space licence

                   The Minister may conduct an annual review of a space licence:

                     (a)  for the purpose of monitoring compliance by the licence holder with this Act and with the conditions of the licence; or

                     (b)  for any other reason that the Minister considers appropriate.

### Division 3—Launch permits

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Granting a launch permit

             (1)  The Minister may grant a launch permit to a person authorising:

                     (a)  the launch of a particular space object; or

                     (b)  a particular series of launches of space objects that, in the Minister’s opinion, having regard to the nature of any payloads to be carried, may appropriately be authorised by a single launch permit;

from a specified launch facility in Australia using a specified kind of launch vehicle.

Note:          Under subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the Minister may vary or revoke a launch permit granted under this section.

             (2)  The launch permit may also authorise particular space objects to be returned, in connection with the launch or launches, to a specified place or area in Australia.

Note:          A returning space object need not be the same as the space object launched. For example, a launch vehicle could carry a payload into an area beyond the distance of 100 km above mean sea level and return without it, or even collect a different payload from an area beyond the distance of 100 km above mean sea level and return that to Earth.

             (3)  The Minister may grant the launch permit to the person only if all of the following criteria are satisfied:

                     (a)  the person holds a space licence (see Division 2) covering the launch facility and the kind of launch vehicle concerned;

                     (b)  the person is a corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies;

                     (c)  the Minister is satisfied that the person who is to carry out the launch or launches, and any connected return, is competent to do so;

                     (d)  the Minister is satisfied that the insurance/financial requirements in Division 7 will be satisfied for the launch or launches, and any connected return;

                     (e)  the Minister is satisfied that the probability of the launch or launches, or any connected return, causing substantial harm to public health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is as low as is reasonably practicable;

                      (f)  the space object or objects concerned are not and do not contain a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction of any other kind;

                     (g)  the Minister does not consider that, for reasons relevant to Australia’s national security, foreign policy or international obligations, the launch permit should not be granted;

                     (h)  any other criteria prescribed by the regulations.

             (4)  If a country other than Australia is also a launching State for the space object or any of the space objects, the Minister may, in deciding whether to grant the launch permit, have regard to:

                     (a)  whether there is an agreement between Australia and that other country under which that country assumes any liability, and indemnifies Australia, for any damage that the space object or objects may cause; and

                     (b)  the terms of that agreement.

Note:          This subsection does not, by implication, limit the matters to which the Minister may have regard.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Australian launches: continuing requirement for space licence

                   If the launch facility specified in a launch permit is in Australia, the permit has no effect during any period when the holder of the permit does not also hold a space licence (see Division 2) covering the facility and the kind of launch vehicle concerned.

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Terms of launch permit

             (1)  A launch permit authorising the launch of a space object or objects, and any connected return:

                     (a)  must specify the day on which it comes into force and the period for which it remains in force; and

                     (b)  is granted subject to the standard launch permit conditions in section 29 and any other conditions specified in the regulations or in the launch permit.

             (2)  A launch permit may specify that the period during which it remains in force ends on the occurrence of a particular event (rather than at a specified time). For this purpose, the regulations may set out how to determine when events of a particular kind occur.

Example:    A launch permit might specify that it expires when the relevant launch has been (successfully or unsuccessfully) completed. The regulations could set out how to determine when this is.

             (3)  At any time when a launch permit is in force, the Minister may, by written notice, extend or further extend the period for which the permit remains in force.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Standard launch permit conditions

             (1)  The holder of a launch permit must not contravene a condition of the launch permit (whether or not the condition is a standard launch permit condition).

Note:          Contravening this subsection is not an offence. However, a person who contravenes this subsection is liable to a civil penalty under Part 6.

             (2)  If the holder of a launch permit:

                     (a)  by any intentional act or omission, contravenes a standard launch permit condition (see section 29) of the permit; and

                     (b)  is reckless as to whether the act or omission contravenes the condition;

the holder is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by:

                     (c)  in the case of a body corporate—a fine not exceeding 100,000 penalty units; or

                     (d)  in the case of an individual—imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or a fine not exceeding 600 penalty units, or both.

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Transfer of launch permit

             (1)  The Minister may, by written notice, transfer a launch permit to another person if the Minister could grant the launch permit to the other person under section 26.

             (2)  The transfer takes effect at the time specified in the notice.

             (3)  The permit continues to cover the same launch facility, the same kind of launch vehicle and the same space object or objects.

             (4)  The permit has effect subject to the same conditions as the original permit (unless the Minister varies the conditions).

             (5)  The period for which the permit remains in force continues to run despite the transfer.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Applying for the grant, variation or transfer of a launch permit

                   An application for the grant, variation or transfer of a launch permit must be made in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  Procedure etc.

             (1)  If the Minister considers that there may be grounds to vary, revoke or transfer a launch permit (other than at the permit holder’s request), the Minister must:

                     (a)  give the holder of the permit written notice of the Minister’s opinion specifying the reasons for that opinion; and

                     (b)  invite the holder to make a written submission to the Minister about the matter within a reasonable period specified in the notice.

             (2)  In deciding whether to vary, revoke or transfer the permit, the Minister must consider the matters raised in any submission received within the period specified in the notice.

             (3)  A launch permit must not be varied in a way that changes the location of the relevant launch facility.

             (4)  The regulations may prescribe other ways in which a launch permit must not be varied.

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Suspending a launch permit

             (1)  The Minister may, by written notice, suspend a launch permit if:

                     (a)  the holder of the permit contravenes a condition of the permit; or

                     (b)  the Minister considers that, for reasons relevant to Australia’s national security, foreign policy or international obligations, the permit should be suspended; or

                     (c)  an incident involving a space object covered by the permit occurs during the liability period for the launch or return of the object.

Note:          Under subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the Minister may revoke a suspension.

             (2)  A launch permit has no effect while suspended, but the period for which it remains in force continues to run despite the suspension.

                     (b)  the Minister is satisfied that the probability of the launch or launches causing substantial harm to public health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is sufficiently low;

                     (c)  the Minister does not consider that, for reasons relevant to Australia’s national security, foreign policy or international obligations, the overseas launch certificate should not be granted;

                     (d)  any other criteria prescribed by the regulations.

             (3)  The Minister may, in deciding whether to grant the overseas launch certificate, have regard to:

                     (a)  whether there is an agreement or arrangement between Australia and the other launching State, or any of the other launching States, under which that State or those States assume liability, and indemnify Australia, for any damage that the space object or objects may cause; and

                     (b)  the terms of that agreement or arrangement.

                     (c)  the Minister considers that, for reasons relevant to Australia’s national security, foreign policy or international obligations, the certificate should be suspended.

Note:          Under subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the Minister may revoke a suspension.

             (2)  An overseas launch certificate has no effect while suspended, but the period for which it remains in force continues to run despite the suspension.

             (3)  An overseas launch certificate may be revoked or varied even while it is suspended.

### Division 5—Authorisation of return of overseas-launched space objects

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Scope of Division

                   This Division applies if:

                     (a)  a space object is launched, or is proposed to be launched, from a launch facility outside Australia; and

                     (b)  in connection with that launch, a space object is proposed to be returned to an area or place within Australia.

Note:          The returning space object need not be the same as the space object launched. For example, a launch vehicle could carry a payload into an area beyond the distance of 100 km above mean sea level and return without it, or even collect a different payload from an area beyond the distance of 100 km above mean sea level and return that to Earth.

##### <a id="43"></a>43  Returns may be authorised by permission or by agreement

             (1)  The Minister may give a person written permission authorising:

                     (a)  the return of the space object concerned to a specified place or area in Australia; or

                     (b)  a particular series of such returns that, in the Minister’s opinion, having regard to the nature of the space objects to be returned, may appropriately be authorised by a single permission.

Note:          Under subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the Minister may vary or revoke an authorisation granted under this section.

             (2)  Alternatively, the Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with a person under which such a return or such a series of returns is authorised.

             (3)  The return or returns may be authorised under this section only if all of the following criteria are satisfied:

                     (a)  the Minister is satisfied that the person who is to carry out the return or returns is competent to do so;

                     (b)  the Minister is satisfied that the insurance/financial requirements in Division 7 will be satisfied for the return or returns;

                     (c)  the Minister is satisfied that the probability of the return or returns causing substantial harm to public health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is as low as is reasonably practicable;

                     (d)  the space object or objects concerned are not and do not contain a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction of any other kind;

                     (e)  the Minister does not consider that, for reasons relevant to Australia’s national security, foreign policy or international obligations, the authorisation should not be given;

                      (f)  any other criteria prescribed by the regulations.

             (4)  The Minister may, in deciding whether to give an authorisation under this section, have regard to:

                     (a)  whether there is an agreement or arrangement between Australia and any country that is a launching State for any space object concerned under which that country assumes any liability, and indemnifies Australia, for any damage that the space object may cause; and

                     (b)  the terms of that agreement or arrangement.

Note:          This subsection does not, by implication, limit the matters to which the Minister may have regard.

             (5)  An authorisation under this section may be given subject to any conditions that the Minister determines.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Offences relating to returns

             (1)  If a person returns a space object purportedly in accordance with an authorisation of the kind mentioned in section 43 and:

                     (a)  the return is conducted in a way that is likely to cause substantial harm to public health or public safety or to cause substantial damage to property; or

                     (b)  the space object is or contains a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction of any other kind; or

                     (c)  the space object contains any fissionable material and the Minister’s written approval for this has not first been obtained; or

                     (d)  the insurance/financial requirements in Division 7 are not satisfied for the return;

the person is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by:

                     (e)  in the case of a body corporate—a fine not exceeding 100,000 penalty units; or

                      (f)  in the case of an individual—imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or a fine not exceeding 600 penalty units, or both.

Note 1:       Chapter 2 of the _Criminal Code_ sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.

Note 2:       See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a penalty unit.

             (2)  The Minister may take civil proceedings under Part 6 against a person who is alleged to have committed an offence against subsection (1), as an alternative to prosecution.

##### <a id="45"></a>45  Breaching a condition

                   A person who is authorised under section 43 to return a space object must not contravene a condition of the authorisation.

Note:          Contravening this section is not an offence. However, a person who contravenes this section is liable to a civil penalty under Part 6.

##### <a id="45A"></a>45A  Applying for an authorisation or for the variation of an authorisation

                   An application for an authorisation under section 43, or for the variation of such an authorisation, must be made in accordance with the regulations.

##### <a id="45B"></a>45B  Procedure etc.

             (1)  If the Minister considers that there may be grounds to vary or revoke an authorisation under section 43 (other than at the authorisation holder’s request), the Minister must:

                     (a)  give the holder of the authorisation written notice of the Minister’s opinion specifying the reasons for that opinion; and

                     (b)  invite the holder to make a written submission to the Minister about the matter within a reasonable period specified in the notice.

             (2)  In deciding whether to vary or revoke the authorisation, the Minister must consider the matters raised in any submission received within the period specified in the notice.

##### <a id="45C"></a>45C  Suspending an authorisation under section 43

             (1)  The Minister may, by written notice, suspend an authorisation under section 43 if:

                     (a)  the holder of the authorisation contravenes a condition of the authorisation; or

                     (b)  the Minister considers that, for reasons relevant to Australia’s national security, foreign policy or international obligations, the authorisation should be suspended; or

                     (c)  an incident involving a space object covered by the authorisation occurs during the liability period for the return of the object.

Note:          Under subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the Minister may revoke a suspension.

             (2)  An authorisation under section 43 has no effect while suspended.

             (3)  An authorisation under section 43 may be varied or revoked even while it is suspended.

### Division 6—Exemption certificates

##### <a id="46"></a>46  Exemption certificates

             (1)  The Minister may issue to any person an exemption certificate covering specified conduct that might otherwise be prohibited under section 11, 13 or 15.

Note 1:       Under subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the Minister may vary or revoke an exemption certificate.

Note 2:       Under subsection 33(3A) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, conduct may be specified by reference to a particular class or classes of conduct.

             (2)  The regulations may set out matters to which the Minister must have regard in deciding whether to issue an exemption certificate.

Example:    The regulations might set out criteria such as whether a launch would be in the national interest or would confer a significant national benefit, whether there is a risk that a launch might cause substantial harm to public health or public safety or damage to property or whether there is a risk that a launch might expose the Commonwealth to liability for damage caused.

Note:          This subsection does not, by implication, limit the matters to which the Minister may have regard.

             (3)  Within 7 sitting days of issuing an exemption certificate under this section, the Minister must cause a copy of the exemption certificate to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.

##### <a id="46A"></a>46A  Terms of exemption certificate

             (1)  An exemption certificate:

                     (a)  comes into force on a specified day or when a specified event happens; and

                     (b)  remains in force for a specified period (which may be a period that ends on the occurrence of a specified event).

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the regulations may set out how to determine when events of a particular kind occur.

             (3)  At any time when an exemption certificate is in force, the Minister may, by written notice, extend or further extend the period for which the certificate remains in force.

             (4)  An exemption certificate is granted subject to any conditions specified in the certificate.

##### <a id="46B"></a>46B  Breaching a condition

                   The holder of an exemption certificate must not contravene a condition of the certificate.

Note:          Contravening this section is not an offence. However, a person who contravenes this section is liable to a civil penalty under Part 6.

             (2)  The holder of a launch permit, overseas launch certificate or section 43 authorisation, covering a launch or return, satisfies the **_insurance/financial requirements_** for the launch or return if:

                     (a)  throughout the liability period for the launch or return, the insurance requirements in section 48 are satisfied; or

                     (b)  the holder has, in accordance with the regulations, shown direct financial responsibility for the launch or return for an amount not less than the amount that would otherwise have been applicable under subsection 48(3) for the launch or return.

##### <a id="48"></a>48  Insurance requirements

             (1)  The insurance requirements are satisfied for:

                     (a)  a launch or return authorised by a launch permit; or

if:

                     (c)  the holder of the permit or authorisation is insured (to the extent required by subsection (3)) against any liability that the holder might incur under this Act to pay compensation for any damage to third parties that the launch or return causes; and

                     (d)  the Commonwealth is insured (to the extent required by subsection (3)) against any liability that the Commonwealth might incur, under the Liability Convention or otherwise under international law, to pay compensation for such damage.

Note 1:       The insurance cover mentioned in paragraphs (c) and (d) may be provided by separate policies. Alternatively, the holder of the permit or authorisation could take out a single policy that insures both the holder and the Commonwealth.

Note 2:       The Commonwealth is under no duty to take out any insurance cover under this subsection—the onus is on the holder of the permit or authorisation to ensure that the insurance/financial requirements are satisfied.

             (2)  The insurance requirements are satisfied for a launch authorised by an overseas launch certificate if the Commonwealth is insured (to the extent required by subsection (3)) against any liability of the Commonwealth, under the Liability Convention or otherwise under international law, to pay compensation for any damage to third parties that the launch causes.

Note 1:       The holder of the certificate could take out a single policy that insures both the holder and the Commonwealth.

Note 2:       The Commonwealth is under no duty to take out any insurance cover under this subsection—the onus is on the holder of the certificate to ensure that the insurance/financial requirements are satisfied.

             (3)  The total insurance, for each launch or return concerned, must be for an amount not less than the lesser of the amount of $750 million (as indexed from time to time in accordance with the regulations) and:

                     (a)  the amount of the maximum probable loss that may be incurred in respect of damage to third parties caused by the launch or return, as determined using the method set out in the regulations; or

                     (b)  if the regulations set out a different method of determining a minimum amount for the purposes of this subsection—the amount determined using that method.

##### <a id="49"></a>49  Additional insurance not precluded

                   Nothing in this Act prevents any person from taking out any additional insurance.

##### <a id="64"></a>64  Compensation for third party damage by space objects to be determined solely under this Part

             (1)  Compensation for damage to which this Part applies caused to third parties is only payable in accordance with this Part.

             (2)  However, this section does not prevent Australia from complying with any obligation to pay compensation under the Liability Convention, or otherwise under international law, for such damage.

Note:          This section does not affect the rights of persons who are not third parties (for example, employees of a responsible party) from seeking compensation outside of this Act for damage to which this Part applies. However, see also section 65 (which allows the regulations to make provision in relation to the waiver of such rights).

##### <a id="65"></a>65  Regulations about waivers

                   The regulations may make provision in relation to the waiver of some or all of the rights of persons connected with a launch or return, and of their employees, contractors and subcontractors, to seek compensation for damage to which this Part applies.

### Division 2—Liability for third party damage

#### Subdivision A—Rules for damage caused by launches and most returns

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Scope of Subdivision

                     (b)  as a result of damage to aircraft in flight.

             (2)  However, the responsible party is not liable to the extent that the responsible party establishes that the damage resulted from:

                     (a)  the gross negligence of the third party; or

                     (b)  any conduct (whether by act or omission) that the third party engaged in with intent to cause the damage.

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Damage to other space objects

                   The responsible party for the launch or return of a space object is liable to pay compensation for any damage the space object causes, otherwise than on Earth or as a result of damage to aircraft in flight:

# Schedule 1—Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects

_Note:       This is the copy of the Convention referred to in the definition of Liability Convention in section 8 of this Act._

THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,

RECOGNISING the common interest of all mankind in furthering the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes,

RECALLING the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies,

TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION that, notwithstanding the precautionary measures to be taken by States and international intergovernmental organisations involved in the launching of space objects, damage may on occasion be caused by such objects,

RECOGNISING the need to elaborate effective international rules and procedures concerning liability for damage caused by space objects and to ensure, in particular, the prompt payment under the terms of this Convention of a full and equitable measure of compensation to victims of such damage,

BELIEVING that the establishment of such rules and procedures will contribute to the strengthening of international co-operation in the field of the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes,

HAVE AGREED on the following:

Article I

For the purposes of this Convention:

(a)     The term “damage” means loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; or loss of or damage to property of States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organisations;

(b)     The term “launching” includes attempted launching;

(c)     The term “launching State” means:

(i)      a state which launches or procures the launching of a space object;

(ii)      a State from whose territory or facility a space object is launched;

(d)     The term “space object” includes component parts of a space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof.

Article II

A launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the earth or to aircraft in flight.

Article III

In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.

Article IV

1.         In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, and of damage thereby being caused to a third State or to its natural or juridical persons, the first two States shall be jointly and severally liable to the third State, to the extent indicated by the following:

(a)     If the damage has been caused to the third State on the surface of the earth or to aircraft in flight, their liability to the third State shall be absolute;

(b)     If the damage has been caused to a space object of the third State or to persons or property on board that space object elsewhere than on the surface of the earth, their liability to the third State shall be based on the fault of either of the first two States or on the fault of persons for whom either is responsible.

2.         In all cases of joint and several liability referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the burden of compensation for the damage shall be apportioned between the first two States in accordance with the extent to which they were at fault; if the extent of the fault of each of these States cannot be established, the burden of compensation shall be apportioned equally between them. Such apportionment shall be without prejudice to the right of the third State to seek the entire compensation due under this Convention from any or all of the launching States which are jointly and severally liable.

Article V

1.         Whenever two or more States jointly launch a space object, they shall be jointly and severally liable for any damage caused.

2.         A launching State which has paid compensation for damage shall have the right to present a claim for indemnification to other participants in the joint launching. The participants in a joint launching may conclude agreements regarding the apportioning among themselves of the financial obligation in respect of which they are jointly and severally liable. Such agreements shall be without prejudice to the right of a State sustaining damage to seek the entire compensation due under this Convention from any or all of the launching States which are jointly and severally liable.

3.         A State from whose territory or facility a space object is launched shall be regarded as a participant in a joint launching.

Article VI

1.         Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 or this Article, exoneration from absolute liability shall be granted to the extent that a launching State establishes that the damage has resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant State or of natural or juridical persons it represents.

2.         No exoneration whatever shall be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching State which are not in conformity with international law including, in particular, the Charter of the United Nations and the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies.

Article VII

The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to damage caused by a space object of a launching State to:

(a)     nationals of that launching State;

(b)     foreign nationals during such time as they are participating in the operation of that space object from the time of its launching or at any stage thereafter until its descent, or during such time as they are in the immediate vicinity of a planned launching or recovery area as the result of an invitation by that launching State.

Article VIII

1.         A State which suffers damage, or whose natural or juridical persons suffer damage, may present to a launching State a claim for compensation for such damage.

2.         If the State of nationality has not presented a claim, another State may, in respect of damage sustained in its territory by any natural or juridical person, present a claim to a launching State.

3.         If neither the State of nationality nor the State in whose territory the damage was sustained has presented a claim or notified its intention of presenting a claim, another State may, in respect of damage sustained by its permanent residents, present a claim to a launching State.

Article IX

A claim for compensation for damage shall be presented to a launching State through diplomatic channels. If a State does not maintain diplomatic relations with the launching State concerned, it may request another State to present its claim to that launching State or otherwise represent its interests under this Convention. It may also present its claim through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, provided the claimant State and the launching State are both Members of the United Nations.

Article X

1.         A claim for compensation for damage may be presented to a launching State not later than one year following the date of the occurrence of the damage or the identification of the launching State which is liable.

2.         If, however, a State does not know of the occurrence of the damage or has not been able to identify the launching State which is liable, it may present a claim within one year following the date on which it learned of the aforementioned facts; however, this period shall in no event exceed one year following the date on which the State could reasonably be expected to have learned of the facts through the exercise of due diligence.

3.         The time-limits specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall apply even if the full extent of the damage may not be known. In this event, however, the claimant  State shall be entitled to revise the claim and submit additional documentation after the expiration of such time-limits until one year after the full extent of the damage is known.

Article XI

1.         Presentation of a claim to a launching State for compensation for damage under this Convention shall not require the prior exhaustion of any local remedies which may be available to a claimant State or to natural or juridical persons it represents.

2.         Nothing in this Convention shall prevent a State, or natural or juridical persons it might represent, from pursuing a claim in the courts or administrative tribunals or agencies of a launching State. A State shall not, however, be entitled to present a claim under this Convention in respect of the same damage for which a claim is being pursued in the courts or administrative tribunals or agencies of a launching State or under another international agreement which is binding on the States concerned.

Article XII

The compensation which the launching State shall be liable to pay for damage under this Convention shall be determined in accordance with international law and the principles of justice and equity, in order to provide such reparation in respect of the damage as will restore the person, natural or juridical, State or international organisation on whose behalf the claim is presented to the condition which would have existed if the damage had not occurred.

Article XIII

Unless the claimant State and the State from which compensation is due under this Convention agree on another form of compensation, the compensation shall be paid in the currency of the claimant State or, if that State so requests, in the currency of the State from which compensation is due.

Article XIV

If no settlement of a claim is arrived at through diplomatic negotiations as provided for in Article IX, within one year from the date on which the claimant State notifies the launching State that it has submitted the documentation of its claim, the parties concerned shall establish a Claims Commission at the request of either party.

Article XV

1.         The Claims Commission shall be composed of three members: one appointed by the claimant  State, one appointed by the launching State and the third member, the Chairman, to be chosen by both parties jointly. Each party shall make its appointment within two months of the request for the establishment of the Claims Commission.

2.         If no agreement is reached on the choice of the Chairman within four months of the request for the establishment of the Commission, either party may request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint the Chairman within a further period of two months.

Article XVI

1.         If one of the parties does not make its appointment within the stipulated period, the Chairman shall, at the request of the other party, constitute a single-member Claims Commission.

2.         Any vacancy which may arise in the Commission for whatever reason shall be filled by the same procedure adopted for the original appointment.

3.         The Commission shall determine its own procedure.

4.         The Commission shall determine the place or places where it shall sit and all other administrative matters.

5.         Except in the case of decisions and awards by a single-member Commission, all decisions and awards of the Commission shall be by majority vote.

Article XVII

No increase in the membership of the Claims Commission shall take place by reason of two or more claimant States or launching States being joined in any one proceeding before the Commission. The claimant States so joined shall collectively appoint one member of the Commission in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as would be the case for a single claimant State. When two or more launching States are so joined, they shall collectively appoint one member of the Commission in the same way. If the claimant States or the launching States do not make the appointment within the stipulated period, the Chairman shall constitute a single-member Commission.

Article XVIII

The Claims Commission shall decide the merits of the claim for compensation and determine the amount of compensation payable, if any.

Article XIX

1.         The Claims Commission shall act in accordance with the provisions of Article XII.

2.         The decision of the Commission shall be final and binding if the parties have so agreed; otherwise the Commission shall render a final and recommendatory award, which the parties shall consider in good faith. The Commission shall state the reasons for its decision or award.

4.         The Commission shall make its decision or award public. It shall deliver a certified copy of its decision or award to each of the parties and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Article XX

The expenses in regard to the Claims Commission shall be borne equally by the parties, unless otherwise decided by the Commission.

Article XXI

If the damage caused by a space object presents a large-scale danger to human life or seriously interferes with the living conditions of the population or the functioning of vital centres, the States Parties, and in particular the launching State, shall examine the possibility of rendering appropriate and rapid assistance to the State which has suffered the damage, when it so requests. However, nothing in this Article shall affect the rights or obligations of the States Parties under this Convention.

Article XXII

1.         In this Convention, with the exception of Articles XXIV to XXVII, references to States shall be deemed to apply to any international intergovernmental organisation which conducts space activities if the organisation declares its acceptance of the rights and obligations provided for in this Convention and if a majority of the States members of the organisation are State Parties to this Convention and to the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies.

2.         States members of any such organisation which are States Parties to this Convention shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that the organisation makes a declaration in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

3.         If an international intergovernmental organisation is liable for damage by virtue of the provisions of this Convention, that organisation and those of its members which are States Parties to this Convention shall be jointly and severally liable; provided, however, that:

(a)     any claim for compensation in respect of such damage shall be first presented to the organisation;

(b)     only where the organisation has not paid, within a period of six months, any sum agreed or determined to be due as compensation for such damage, may the claimant State invoke the liability of the members which are States Parties to this Convention for the payment of that sum.

Article XXIII

1.         The provisions of this Convention shall not affect other international agreements in force in so far as relations between the States Parties to such agreements are concerned.

THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,

RECOGNIZING the common interest of all mankind in furthering the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes,

RECALLING that the Treaty on principles governing the activities of States in the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies of 27 January 1967 affirms that States shall bear international responsibility for their national activities in outer space and refers to the State on whose registry an object launched into outer space is carried,

RECALLING also that the Agreement on the rescue of astronauts, the return of astronauts and the return of objects launched into outer space of 22 April 1968 provides that a launching authority shall, upon request, furnish identifying data prior to the return of an object it has launched into outer space found beyond the territorial limits of the launching authority,

RECALLING further that the Convention on international liability for damage caused by space objects of 29 March 1972 establishes international rules and procedures concerning the liability of launching States for damage caused by their space objects,

DESIRING, in the light of the Treaty on principles governing the activities of States in the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, to make provision for the national registration by launching States of space objects launched into outer space,

DESIRING further that a central register of objects launched into outer space be established and maintained, on a mandatory basis, by the Secretary-General of the United Nations,

DESIRING also to provide for States Parties additional means and procedures to assist in the identification of space objects,

BELIEVING that a mandatory system of registering objects launched into outer space would, in particular, assist in their identification and would contribute to the application and development of international law governing the exploration and use of outer space,

HAVE AGREED on the following:

Article I

(b)     The term “space object” includes component parts of a space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof;

(c)     The term “State of registry” means a launching State on whose registry a space object is carried in accordance with article II.

Article II

1.         When a space object is launched into earth orbit or beyond, the launching State shall register the space object by means of an entry in an appropriate registry which it shall maintain. Each launching State shall inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the establishment of such a registry.

2.         Where there are two or more launching States in respect of any such space object, they shall jointly determine which one of them shall register the object in accordance with paragraph 1 of this article, bearing in mind the provisions of article VIII of the Treaty on principles governing the activities of States in the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, and without prejudice to appropriate agreements concluded or to be concluded among the launching States on jurisdiction and control over the space object and over any personnel thereof.

3.         The contents of each registry and the conditions under which it is maintained shall be determined by the State of registry concerned.

Article III

1.         The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall maintain a Register in which the information furnished in accordance with article IV shall be recorded.

2.         There shall be full and open access to the information in this Register.

(b)     An appropriate designator of the space object or its registration number;

(c)     Date and territory or location of launch;

(d)     Basic orbital parameters, including:

(i)    Nodal period,

(ii)   Inclination,

(iii)  Apogee,

(iv)  Perigee;

(e)     General function of the space object.

2.         Each State of registry may, from time to time, provide the Secretary-General of the United Nations with additional information concerning a space object carried on its registry.

3.         Each State of registry shall notify the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to the greatest extent feasible and as soon as practicable, of space objects concerning which it has previously transmitted information, and which have been but no longer are in earth orbit.

Article V

Whenever a space object launched into earth orbit or beyond is marked with the designator or registration number referred to in article IV, paragraph 1(b), or both, the State of registry shall notify the Secretary-General of this fact when submitting the information regarding the space object in accordance with article IV.

**ATTACHMENT**

**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

The Parties shall use their best endeavours to ensure the effective protection of results obtained within the framework of cooperation, which is a subject of this Agreement and separate agreements referred to in Article 5 of this Agreement.

The Competent Agencies, and departments, agencies and organisations referred to in Article 3.2 of this Agreement, hereinafter described as “cooperating organisations”, shall in good time inform each other about all results of joint activity subject to protection as intellectual property and promptly cooperate to obtain registration or carry out other procedures for protection.

**1.         Sphere of Application**

**1.**This Attachment applies to all types of joint activity performed pursuant to the cooperation under this Agreement, with the exception of those cases when the Parties or cooperating organisations agree on any special provisions within the framework of separate agreements referred to in Article 5 of this Agreement.

**2.**For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “intellectual property” has the meaning provided for in Article 2 of the Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization done at Stockholm on 14 July 1967.

**3.**This Attachment shall regulate the allocation of intellectual property rights between the Parties or cooperating organisations in relation to a joint activity. Each Party shall act in such a way that the cooperating organisations of the other Party can acquire the rights to intellectual property belonging to them in accordance with this Attachment.

**4.**This Attachment does not change the Parties’ legal regulation of intellectual property rights determined by the legislation of their States and the internal regulations of cooperating organisations taking into account provisions envisaged in section 2, paragraph 6 of this Attachment. In the same way, this Attachment does not alter the relations between the cooperating organisations of each Party and relations between the Parties and these organisations. Furthermore it will not prejudice the international obligations of the Parties.

**5.**Carrying out of joint works does not affect the intellectual property rights of the cooperating organisations acquired earlier or resulting from independent research (background intellectual property).

**6.**The termination of this Agreement does not affect rights or obligations having arisen on the basis of this Attachment, if they were accepted before such termination.

**2.         Grant of Rights**

**1.**In relation to intellectual property created in the course of a joint activity, the Parties or cooperating organisations shall strive to jointly elaborate a plan for the assessment and use of technology either before the beginning of their cooperation or within a reasonable time from the moment when a cooperating organisation creates an object of intellectual property. In this plan for the assessment and use of technology, they shall take into account the corresponding contributions of the Parties and their cooperating organisations to the activity under consideration, including background intellectual property transferred in the framework of cooperation, define types and scope of use of the intellectual property, terms and procedures of the realisation of rights on it on the territory of the States of the Parties, as well as on the territory of other countries, recognising that the minimal scope is the right of each cooperating organisation to use created intellectual property for its own needs. For the purposes of granting intellectual property rights, an activity is considered to be a joint activity from the moment when it is defined as such in separate agreements referred to in Article 5 of this Agreement. The grant of rights to the objects of intellectual property created as a result of an activity, which is not a joint activity, shall be carried out according to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this section. The Parties or cooperating organisations shall decide by mutual arrangement whether the results of work jointly carried out should be either patented or registered or kept secret.

**2.**If such a plan for the assessment and use of technology is not established within four months from the moment of the creation of the object of intellectual property which is a result of a joint activity, each of the Parties or cooperating organisations may receive all rights and benefits from such intellectual property on its State’s territory. Cooperating organisations shall in relation to a joint activity negotiate regarding the allocation of intellectual property rights, as well as the expenses related to the protection of intellectual property rights under mutually agreed conditions, taking into account the corresponding contributions of each of them.

**3.**In cases, which are not joint activities, the terms for the implementation of a procedure for the acquisition and use of intellectual property rights shall be determined in separate agreements and contracts.

**4.**The Parties shall on the initiative of either of them, without delay, consult for the purposes of securing protection and distribution of intellectual property rights on protected objects of intellectual property in third countries applying the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section.

**5.**The rules for the internal regulation of host organisations or institutions as regards intellectual property rights as well as possible remuneration and disbursements related to these rights as they are determined by the internal regulations of each of the host organisations extend to researchers and scientists of one of the Parties enlisted in the service of any organisation or institution of the other Party. Each researcher or scientist, designated as an inventor is entitled in accordance with his contribution to a share of remuneration to be earned by the host organisation or institution for licensing this intellectual property.

**6.**Copyright extends to publications. Each Party and its cooperating organisations shall be entitled to non-exclusive, irrevocable and free licences for non-commercial purposes for the translation, reproduction and public distribution in all countries of scientific and technical articles, lectures (reports), books and other copyright products, which are the direct result of a joint activity. The forms of implementation of these rights shall be determined in separate agreements and contracts. All copies of publications should show the author’s name unless he expressly refuses to give his name or wishes to appear under a pseudonym.

**7.**The totality of intellectual property rights, but not including moral rights, to computer programs elaborated within the framework of cooperation shall be allocated between the cooperating organisations taking into account their contribution to its elaboration and financing. In cases of joint elaboration or joint financing of computer programs by both Parties or cooperating organisations a regime to be applied in relation to these programs, including the allocation of remuneration in the case of commercial use, shall be determined by separate agreements or contracts. In the absence of separate agreements or contracts the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section related to the allocation of rights in connection with a joint activity shall apply.

**8.**Confidential information shall be designated as such in an appropriate manner. The responsibility for such a designation shall rest with the Party or cooperating organisation, which demands such confidentiality. Each Party or cooperating organisation shall protect such information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of its State. The term “confidential information” means any know-how, data or information, in particular technical, commercial or financial, independent of the form in which it is passed on for the purposes of carrying out activity pursuant to this Agreement and which corresponds to the following conditions:

a)       the possession of this information may ensure gains, in particular ones of an economic, scientific or technical character or give an advantage in competition with persons who do not possess it;

b)       this information is not generally known or widely available from other sources;

c)       this information was not earlier passed on by its possessor to a third person without the obligation to maintain its confidentiality;

d)       this information is not already at the disposal of the recipient without the obligation to maintain its confidentiality.

The Parties or cooperating organisations may transfer confidential information to their own employees, unless otherwise provided in separate agreements referred to in Article 5 of this Agreement. Such information may be passed on to the basic performers of the work and subcontractors within the framework of the sphere of application of separate contracts with them. Information given in this way may be used only within the limits of the sphere of application of those contracts, which would envisage the conditions and time limits of application of such provisions on confidentiality.

The Parties and cooperating organisations undertake to adopt all necessary measures in relation to their employees, basic performers of work and subcontractors for the observance of the obligations on protecting confidentiality determined above.

**9.**The grant of the results of joint research and elaboration to third persons shall be the subject of written agreements between the Parties or cooperating organisations. Without prejudice to the implementation of rights in accordance with paragraph 6 of this section, such agreements will determine the procedure for the distribution of the referred results.
