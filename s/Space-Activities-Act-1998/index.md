 Note:	This is the copy of the Convention referred to in the definition of _Liability Convention_ in section&#160;8 of this Act.

THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,
 RECOGNISING the common interest of all mankind in furthering the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes,
 RECALLING the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies,
 TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION that, notwithstanding the precautionary measures to be taken by States and international intergovernmental organisations involved in the launching of space objects, damage may on occasion be caused by such objects,
 RECOGNISING the need to elaborate effective international rules and procedures concerning liability for damage caused by space objects and to ensure, in particular, the prompt payment under the terms of this Convention of a full and equitable measure of compensation to victims of such damage,
 BELIEVING that the establishment of such rules and procedures will contribute to the strengthening of international co-operation in the field of the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes,
 HAVE AGREED on the following:
 <center>Article I</center>
 For the purposes of this Convention:
 (a)	The term "damage" means loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; or loss of or damage to property of States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organisations;
 (b)	The term "launching" includes attempted launching;
 (c)	The term "launching State" means:
 (i)	a state which launches or procures the launching of a space object;
 (ii)	a State from whose territory or facility a space object is launched;
 (d)	The term "space object" includes component parts of a space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof.
 <center>Article II</center>

<center>Back to Top</center>
 A launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the earth or to aircraft in flight.
 <center>Article III</center>
 In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.
 <center>Article IV</center>
 1.	In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, and of damage thereby being caused to a third State or to its natural or juridical persons, the first two States shall be jointly and severally liable to the third State, to the extent indicated by the following:
 (a)	If the damage has been caused to the third State on the surface of the earth or to aircraft in flight, their liability to the third State shall be absolute;
 (b)	If the damage has been caused to a space object of the third State or to persons or property on board that space object elsewhere than on the surface of the earth, their liability to the third State shall be based on the fault of either of the first two States or on the fault of persons for whom either is responsible.
 2.	In all cases of joint and several liability referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the burden of compensation for the damage shall be apportioned between the first two States in accordance with the extent to which they were at fault; if the extent of the fault of each of these States cannot be established, the burden of compensation shall be apportioned equally between them. Such apportionment shall be without prejudice to the right of the third State to seek the entire compensation due under this Convention from any or all of the launching States which are jointly and severally liable.
 <center>Article V</center>
 1.	Whenever two or more States jointly launch a space object, they shall be jointly and severally liable for any damage caused.
 2.	A launching State which has paid compensation for damage shall have the right to present a claim for indemnification to other participants in the joint launching. The participants in a joint launching may conclude agreements regarding the apportioning among themselves of the financial obligation in respect of which they are jointly and severally liable. Such agreements shall be without prejudice to the right of a State sustaining damage to seek the entire compensation due under this Convention from any or all of the launching States which are jointly and severally liable.
 3.	A State from whose territory or facility a space object is launched shall be regarded as a participant in a joint launching.
 <center>Article VI</center>
 1.	Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 or this Article, exoneration from absolute liability shall be granted to the extent that a launching State establishes that the damage has resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant State or of natural or juridical persons it represents.
 2.	No exoneration whatever shall be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching State which are not in conformity with international law including, in particular, the Charter of the United Nations and the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies.
 <center>Article VII</center>
 The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to damage caused by a space object of a launching State to:
 (a)	nationals of that launching State;
 (b)	foreign nationals during such time as they are participating in the operation of that space object from the time of its launching or at any stage thereafter until its descent, or during such time as they are in the immediate vicinity of a planned launching or recovery area as the result of an invitation by that launching State.
 <center>Article VIII</center>
 1.	A State which suffers damage, or whose natural or juridical persons suffer damage, may present to a launching State a claim for compensation for such damage.

 <center>Liability</center>
 1.	In the interests of encouraging the development of joint activities pursuant to this Agreement, without prejudice to separate agreements which may be entered into by the Parties to take into account the particular needs and specific circumstances of pursuing certain programs and projects of cooperation, and without prejudice to the international obligations of the Parties, including under the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects of 29&#160;March 1972 (Liability Convention), the obligations of the Parties to each other in relation to liability and indemnity shall be in accordance with this Article.

The terms "contractors" and "subcontractors" may include suppliers of any kind.
 4.	In respect to a protected activity, each Party agrees to a cross-waiver of liability and, accordingly, each Party waives any claims for damages against the other Party, related entities of the other Party and employees of the other Party or employees of related entities of the other Party, whatever the legal basis for such claims, including, amongst others, claims under the Liability Convention or other claims under international law or claims in contract.

 b)	claims made by a natural person not falling within the definition of a related entity, his/her estate, survivors, or subrogees in connection with indemnifying damage for bodily injury or any other damage to such natural person or his/her death;
 c)	claims for damage caused by wilful misconduct;
 d)	intellectual property claims.
 8.	Nothing in this Article shall be construed to create the basis for claims or suits where none would otherwise exist.
 9.	The Parties shall consult promptly on any potential liability under international law, including the Liability Convention, on the apportionment of 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 liability, and in the event of claims arising, on the defence of claims, and shall cooperate fully with a view to establishing the facts in the investigation of any accident, in particular through the exchange of experts and information.
 <center>Article 11</center>
 <center>Customs Regulation</center>
 1.	For the purposes of this Article "goods" shall mean spacecraft, space transportation systems, their elements, instruments, control, testing and other types of equipment required, in particular for a launch, as well as technologies in the form of information and data recorded on material media.

 3.	Where the domestic law and regulations of the States of the Parties do not provide for direct exemption from other taxes on goods for the purposes of cooperation under this Agreement, and such taxes are collected by customs authorities, such an exemption shall be applied on the basis of this Agreement subject to the domestic law and regulations of the States of the Parties.
 <center>Article 12</center>
 <center>Export Control</center>

 <center>Economic and Industrial Types of Activity</center>

 2.	Disputes between Competent Agencies or between departments, agencies and organisations referred to in Article 3.2 of this Agreement shall be referred, for joint consideration, to the senior executives of respectively, Competent Agencies, and these departments, agencies and organisations or their plenipotentiaries, who should make all efforts to resolve the dispute by consensus.

 3.	If a dispute has not been settled by means of procedures envisaged in paragraph 1 of this Article within six months after one of the Parties forwards a written request to hold such negotiations or consultations, it shall, upon request of either Party, be submitted to an Arbitral Tribunal which shall be established in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
 4.	An Arbitral Tribunal shall be constituted for each individual case in the following way:

<center>Back to Top</center>
 a)	within two months of the receipt of the request for consideration of the dispute by arbitration, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator. Those two arbitrators shall then select a national of a third country who, on approval by the two Parties, shall be appointed Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal. The Chairman shall be appointed within two months from the date of appointment of the other two arbitrators;
 b)	in case an arbitrator appointed as provided for in this Article shall resign or become unable to act, a successor arbitrator shall be appointed in the same manner as prescribed for the appointment of the original arbitrator and the successor shall have all the powers and duties of the original arbitrator.
 5.	If, within the period specified in paragraph 4 of this Article, the necessary appointments have not been made, either Party may, in the absence of any other agreement, invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make all necessary appointments. If the President is a national of the State of either Party or is unable to discharge the said function, the next most senior Member of the Court who is not disqualified on such a ground shall make the necessary appointments.
 6.	The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide all questions relating to its competence and shall, subject to the agreement between the Parties, determine its own procedure. The Arbitral Tribunal shall reach its award by majority vote taking into account the provisions of this Agreement, the international treaties both Parties have concluded and the generally recognised norms and principles of international law. It may render an award on the default of a Party. Any award shall be rendered in writing and shall state its legal basis.

 7.	Each Party shall bear the costs of its arbitrator. The costs of the Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal and other expenses associated with the conduct of the arbitration shall be borne in equal parts by both Parties. The Arbitral Tribunal may decide, however, that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the Parties.
 <center>Article 16</center>
 <center>Final Provisions</center>
 1.	This Agreement shall enter into force from the date of the latter written notification through diplomatic channels on completion by the Parties of domestic procedures necessary for its entry into force.
 2.	This Agreement is concluded for a period of ten  years. Its effect shall be automatically extended for a subsequent ten-year period if neither of the Parties notifies the other Party through diplomatic channels of its intention to terminate it twelve months before the expiry of the initial ten-year period. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party in the period following its automatic extension by twelve months written notice to the other Party through diplomatic channels.

<center>ATTACHMENT</center>
 <center>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</center>
 The Parties shall use their best endeavours to ensure the effective protection of results obtained within the framework of cooperation, which is a subject of 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 this Agreement and separate agreements referred to in Article 5 of this Agreement.
 The Competent Agencies, and departments, agencies and organisations referred to in Article 3.2 of this Agreement, hereinafter described as "cooperating organisations", shall in good time inform each other about all results of joint activity subject to protection as intellectual property and promptly cooperate to obtain registration or carry out other procedures for protection.
 <center>1.	Sphere of Application</center>
 1.	This Attachment applies to all types of joint activity performed pursuant to the cooperation under this Agreement, with the exception of those cases when the Parties or cooperating organisations agree on any special provisions within the framework of separate agreements referred to in Article 5 of this Agreement.
 2.	For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "intellectual property" has the meaning provided for in Article 2 of the Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organi done at Stockholm on 14&#160;July 1967.
 3.	This Attachment shall regulate the allocation of intellectual property rights between the Parties or cooperating organisations in relation to a joint activity. Each Party shall act in such a way that the cooperating organisations of the other Party can acquire the rights to intellectual property belonging to them in accordance with this Attachment.
 4.	This Attachment does not change the Parties' legal regulation of intellectual property rights determined by the legislation of their States and the internal regulations of cooperating organisations taking into account provisions envisaged in section&#160;2, paragraph 6 of this Attachment. In the same way, this Attachment does not alter the relations between the cooperating organisations of each Party and relations between the Parties and these organisations. Furthermore it will not prejudice the international obligations of the Parties.
 5.	Carrying out of joint works does not affect the intellectual property rights of the cooperating organisations acquired earlier or resulting from independent research (background intellectual property).
 6.	The termination of this Agreement does not affect rights or obligations having arisen on the basis of this Attachment, if they were accepted before such termination.
 <center>2.	Grant of Rights</center>
 1.	In relation to intellectual property created in the course of a joint activity, the Parties or cooperating organisations shall strive to jointly elaborate a plan for the assessment and use of technology either before the beginning of their cooperation or within a reasonable time from the moment when a cooperating organisation creates an object of intellectual property. In this plan for the assessment and use of technology, they shall take into account the corresponding contributions of the Parties and their cooperating organisations to the activity under consideration, including background intellectual property transferred in the framework of cooperation, define types and scope of use of the intellectual property, terms and procedures of the realisation of rights on it on the territory of the States of the Parties, as well as on the territory of other countries, recognising that the minimal scope is the right of each cooperating organisation to use created intellectual property for its own needs. For the purposes of granting intellectual property rights, an activity is considered to be a joint activity from the moment when it is defined as such in separate agreements referred to in Article 5 of this Agreement. The grant of rights to the objects of intellectual property created as a result of an activity, which is not a joint activity, shall be carried out according to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this section. The Parties or cooperating organisations shall decide by mutual arrangement whether the results of work jointly carried out should be either patented or registered or kept secret.
 2.	If such a plan for the assessment and use of technology is not established within four months from the moment of the creation of the object of intellectual property which is a result of a joint activity, each of the Parties or cooperating organisations may receive all rights and benefits from such intellectual property on its State's territory. Cooperating organisations shall in relation to a joint activity negotiate regarding the allocation of intellectual property rights, as well as the expenses related to the protection of intellectual property rights under mutually agreed conditions, taking into account the corresponding contributions of each of them.
 3.	In cases, which are not joint activities, the terms for the implementation of a procedure for the acquisition and use of intellectual property rights shall be determined in separate agreements and contracts.
 4.	The Parties shall on the initiative of either of them, without delay, consult for the purposes of securing protection and distribution of intellectual property rights on protected objects of intellectual property in third countries applying the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section.
 5.	The rules for the internal regulation of host organisations or institutions as regards intellectual property rights as well as possible remuneration and disbursements related to these rights as they are determined by the internal regulations of each of the host organisations extend to researchers and scientists of one of the Parties enlisted in the service of any 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 organisation or institution of the other Party. Each researcher or scientist, designated as an inventor is entitled in accordance with his contribution to a share of remuneration to be earned by the host organisation or institution for licensing this intellectual property.
 6.	Copyright extends to publications. Each Party and its cooperating organisations shall be entitled to non-exclusive, irrevocable and free licences for non-commercial purposes for the translation, reproduction and public distribution in all countries of scientific and technical articles, lectures (reports), books and other copyright products, which are the direct result of a joint activity. The forms of implementation of these rights shall be determined in separate agreements and contracts. All copies of publications should show the author's name unless he expressly refuses to give his name or wishes to appear under a pseudonym.
 7.	The totality of intellectual property rights, but not including moral rights, to computer programs elaborated within the framework of cooperation shall be allocated between the cooperating organisations taking into account their contribution to its elaboration and financing. In cases of joint elaboration or joint financing of computer programs by both Parties or cooperating organisations a regime to be applied in relation to these programs, including the allocation of remuneration in the case of commercial use, shall be determined by separate agreements or contracts. In the absence of separate agreements or contracts the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section related to the allocation of rights in connection with a joint activity shall apply.
 8.	Confidential information shall be designated as such in an appropriate manner. The responsibility for such a designation shall rest with the Party or cooperating organisation, which demands such confidentiality. Each Party or cooperating organisation shall protect such information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of its State. The term "confidential information" means any know-how, data or information, in particular technical, commercial or financial, independent of the form in which it is passed on for the purposes of carrying out activity pursuant to this Agreement and which corresponds to the following conditions:
 a)	the possession of this information may ensure gains, in particular ones of an economic, scientific or technical character or give an advantage in competition with persons who do not possess it;
 b)	this information is not generally known or widely available from other sources;
 c)	this information was not earlier passed on by its possessor to a third person without the obligation to maintain its confidentiality;
 d)	this information is not already at the disposal of the recipient without the obligation to maintain its confidentiality.
 The Parties or cooperating organisations may transfer confidential information to their own employees, unless otherwise provided in separate agreements referred to in Article 5 of this Agreement. Such information may be passed on to the basic performers of the work and subcontractors within the framework of the sphere of application of separate contracts with them. Information given in this way may be used only within the limits of the sphere of application of those contracts, which would envisage the conditions and time limits of application of such provisions on confidentiality.
 The Parties and cooperating organisations undertake to adopt all necessary measures in relation to their employees, basic performers of work and subcontractors for the observance of the obligations on protecting confidentiality determined above.
 9.	The grant of the results of joint research and elaboration to third persons shall be the subject of written agreements between the Parties or cooperating organisations. Without prejudice to the implementation of rights in accordance with paragraph 6 of this section, such agreements will determine the procedure for the distribution of the referred results.
