**Notes** 

## An Act relating to the small superannuation accounts scheme

## Part 1—Introduction

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement

                   This Act commences on 1 July 1995.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Simplified explanation

                   The following is a simplified explanation of this Act:

* * *

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The Australian Taxation

Office administers a Special Account. Notional **accounts** are kept within

the Special Account. **Employers** may **deposit** money for their **employees**

instead of making superannuation contributions. These deposits are credited to

the notional accounts.</li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The account offers

employees with small balances an opportunity to avoid the erosion of those

balances by fees. </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Employees may request that

account balances be **transferred** to a nominated **superannuation fund**or

**RSA**. </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Except in special cases,

employees will not have direct access to their account balances. </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">**•      Interest** will be

calculated on the daily balance of the account and credited to the account on a

quarterly basis. </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Interest is **exempt from income tax**. </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      If an account balance

exceeds $1,200, interest will **only** be credited on the **first $1,200**

of the balance. This is an incentive for employees to request that balances of

more than $1,200 be transferred to a superannuation fund. </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, employers may get **income tax deductions** for

deposits. There is an annual deduction limit of $1,200 per employee. </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      Under the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992_, deposits made by an employer will be **treated as superannuation contributions**. </li>

<li class="BoxList" style="margin-left:21.25pt">•      The accounts may also be

credited with Government co‑contributions payable under the _Superannuation (Government Co‑contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003_. The rules for

these deposits differ in some respects from those that apply to other deposits.</li>

                     (b)  adding up those totals; and

                     (c)  dividing the result by the number of days in the quarter.

For the purposes of this calculation, if an account balance actually exceeds $1,200, the account balance is taken to be $1,200.

Provisional rate

             (3)  Calculate the **_provisional rate_** for the quarter as a percentage (to 4 decimal places) using the formula:

                    <a name="total-balanc"></a>**_Total balances_** means the total balances for the quarter.

Note:          **_Gross interest amount_** is defined by section 38.

Allocation rate—comparison between provisional rate and capped rate

             (6)  Compare the provisional rate with the capped rate:

                     (a)  if the provisional rate is less than or equal to the capped rate—the allocation rate equals the provisional rate; or

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Rate of accrual, and crediting, of interest

When section applies

             (1)  This section applies to interest that accrues under section 49.

Allocation day event, withdrawal event and inactive account debit event

             (2)  Both:

                     (a)  the rate of accrual of interest to an account in respect of a particular day (the **_accrual day_**) in a particular quarter; and

                     (b)  the time at which accrued interest in respect of the accrual day is to be credited to the account;

depends on whichever of the following events first happens after the accrual day:

                     (c)  the occurrence of the allocation day for the quarter (this event is to be known as the **_allocation day event_**);

                     (d)  the withdrawal under Part 7 of the balance of the account (this event is to be known as the **_withdrawal event_**);

                     (e)  the debiting of the balance of the account from the Special Account under Part 9 (this event is to be known as the **_inactive account debit event_**).

Allocation day event

             (3)  If the allocation day event comes first:

                     (a)  the rate of accrual is the percentage worked out (to 6 decimal places) using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00849/Html/f2bf17be-1e5f-4d48-b809-ce181529f8c9_files/image004.gif)

                            where:

                    <a name="alloc-rate"></a>**_Allocation rate_** means the allocation rate for the quarter; and

                     (b)  the accrued interest is to be credited to the account on the allocation day.

Withdrawal event

             (4)  If the withdrawal event comes first:

                     (a)  the rate of accrual is the percentage worked out (to 6 decimal places) using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00849/Html/f2bf17be-1e5f-4d48-b809-ce181529f8c9_files/image005.gif)

                            where:

                    <a name="adjusted-alloc-rate"></a>**_Adjusted allocation rate_** means the last allocation rate that was published in the _Gazette_ before the accrual day; and

                     (b)  the accrued interest is to be credited to the account on the day before the day of the withdrawal.

Inactive account debit event

             (5)  If the inactive account debit event comes first:

                     (a)  the rate of accrual is the percentage worked out (to 6 decimal places) using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00849/Html/f2bf17be-1e5f-4d48-b809-ce181529f8c9_files/image005.gif)

                            where:

                    <a name="adjusted-alloc-rate"></a>**_Adjusted allocation rate_** means the last allocation rate that was published in the _Gazette_ before the accrual day; and

                     (b)  the accrued interest is to be credited to the account on the day of the debit.

Transitional—withdrawal event before first allocation day

             (6)  Despite paragraph (4)(a), if the withdrawal event occurs before the allocation day for the quarter beginning on 1 July 1995, that paragraph has effect, in relation to that event, as if the adjusted allocation rate were 0.4% or such higher rate as the Finance Minister determines.

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Rounding up

                   If the total amount of interest to be credited to an account on a particular day (when expressed as a number of cents) is not a number of whole cents, that total must be rounded up to the nearest cent.

##### <a id="52"></a>52  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Division: 

* * *

Reversing interest credit

             (2)  If interest has been credited to an individual’s account in contravention of subsection (1), the Commissioner of Taxation must debit the account by the amount of the credit. The debit must be made before the account balance is debited by the amount of the refund payment.

                     (b)  the Commissioner of Taxation amalgamates the separate accounts into a single account; and

                     (c)  immediately after the amalgamation, the balance of the amalgamated account exceeds $1,200.

Note:          Section 18 empowers the Commissioner to amalgamate the separate accounts.

No interest if $1,200 limit avoided

             (2)  If, because of the $1,200 limit referred to in subsection 49(2):

                     (a)  the total amount of interest that accrued to the separate accounts before the day of the amalgamation;

exceeds:

                     (b)  the total amount of interest that would have accrued to the amalgamated account if it were assumed that the amalgamated account had been in existence at all times since the earliest time at which any of the separate accounts was opened;

then, despite section 49, the excess interest is taken never to have accrued under that section.

Debit to amalgamated account

             (3)  If excess interest has been credited in contravention of subsection (2), the Commissioner of Taxation must debit the amalgamated account by an amount equal to the amount of the credit.
