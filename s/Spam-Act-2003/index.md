# Schedule 3—Infringement notices

_Note:       See section 30._

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Object

                   The object of this Schedule is to set up a system of infringement notices for contraventions of civil penalty provisions as an alternative to the institution of proceedings in the Federal Court.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Definitions

                   In this Schedule:

                    <a name="authorised-person"></a>**_authorised person_** means:

                     (a)  the Chair of the ACMA; or

                     (b)  a member of the staff of the ACMA appointed under clause 9.

                    <a name="civil-contravent"></a>**_civil contravention_** means a contravention of a civil penalty provision.

                    <a name="infring-notic"></a>**_infringement notice_** means an infringement notice under clause 3.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  When an infringement notice can be given

             (1)  If an authorised person has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has, on a particular day, committed one or more contraventions of a particular civil penalty provision, the authorised person may give to the person an infringement notice relating to those contraventions.

             (2)  An infringement notice must be given within 12 months after the day on which the civil contraventions are alleged to have taken place.

             (3)  This clause does not authorise the giving of 2 or more infringement notices to a person in relation to contraventions of a particular civil penalty provision that allegedly occurred on the same day.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Matters to be included in an infringement notice

             (1)  An infringement notice must:

                     (a)  set out the name of the person to whom the notice is given; and

                     (b)  set out the name of the authorised person who gave the notice; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  set out brief details of each of the alleged civil contraventions; or

                             (ii)  be accompanied by one or more data processing devices that contain, in electronic form, brief details of each of the alleged civil contraventions; and

                     (d)  contain a statement to the effect that the matter or matters will not be dealt with by the Federal Court if the penalty specified in the notice is paid to the ACMA, on behalf of the Commonwealth, within:

                              (i)  28 days after the notice is given; or

                             (ii)  if the ACMA allows a longer period—that longer period; and

                     (e)  give an explanation of how payment of the penalty is to be made; and

                      (f)  set out such other matters (if any) as are specified by the regulations.

Note:          For the amount of penalty, see clause 5.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the brief details must include the following information in relation to each alleged civil contravention:

                     (a)  the date of the alleged contravention;

                     (b)  the civil penalty provision that was allegedly contravened.

             (3)  Subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) does not authorise the inclusion of information in a data processing device unless, at the time the infringement notice was given, it was reasonable to expect that the information would be readily accessible so as to be useable for subsequent reference.

             (4)  This clause does not limit the operation of the _Electronic Transactions Act 1999_.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Amount of penalty
