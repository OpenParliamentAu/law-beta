 _Step 2._	Work out the amount of the person's allowable income for the period.
 _Step 3._	If the person's ascertained income for the period is less than the person's allowable income for the period, the person satisfies the health care card income test.
 _Step 4._	If the person's ascertained income for the period equals or exceeds the person's allowable income for the period, the person does not satisfy the health care card income test.
