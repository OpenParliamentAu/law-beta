* * *

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">       </span>A person who qualifies for an age pension but defers claiming that pension may be able to get a single lump-sum **_pension bonus_**.

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">       </span>A person who wants to get a pension bonus must **_register_** as a **_member of the pension bonus scheme_**.

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">       </span>To get a pension bonus, a person must accrue between 1 and 5 **_bonus periods_** while deferring age pension.

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">       </span>Generally, a bonus period runs for 1 year.

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">       </span>To accrue a bonus period, the person must **_pass the work test_** for that period.

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">       </span>To pass the work test for a year, either the person, or the person’s partner, must **_gainfully work_** for at least 960 hours during that year.

                     (a)  on the date on which the application is lodged; or

                     (b)  if the Secretary decides that it should take effect on another date—on that other date.

             (4)  The Secretary must not make a decision to extend the period within which a person must lodge an application unless, if it were assumed that the person had been a member of the pension bonus scheme throughout the pre-application period:

                     (a)  the person would have been a non-accruing member for all of the pre-application period; or

                     (b)  both:

                              (i)  the person would have been an accruing member for some or all of the pre-application period; and 

                             (ii)  the person would have passed the work test for each test period that is applicable to the person.

Note 1:       **_Pre-application period_** is defined by subsection (5).

Note 2:       **_Test period_** is defined by subsection (6).

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, the **_pre-application period_** is the period beginning on:

                     (a)  in the case of a person whose date of qualification for the age pension occurs on or after 1 July 1998—the person’s date of qualification for the age pension; or

                     (b)  in the case of a person whose date of qualification for the age pension occurs before 1 July 1998—1 July 1998;

and ending on the date on which the person lodged the application.

             (6)  For the purposes of this section, to work out what is a **_test period_**:

                     (a)  identify the **_overall accruing period_**, which is that part of the pre-application period for which, if it were assumed that the person had been a member of the pension bonus scheme throughout the pre-application period, the person would have been an accruing member of the scheme;

                     (b)  if the overall accruing period is 365 days or less—the overall accruing period is the only test period;

                     (c)  if the overall accruing period is longer than 365 days—each of the following periods is a test period:

                              (i)  the full-year period beginning at the start of the overall accruing period;

                             (ii)  if 2 or more succeeding full-year periods are included in the overall accruing period—each of those full-year periods;

                            (iii)  the remainder (if any) of the overall accruing period.

             (7)  For the purposes of subsection (4), the Secretary is taken to have waived compliance with the applicable record-keeping requirements in relation to each test period.

Date of qualification for the age pension

             (8)  For the purposes of this section, a person’s **_date of qualification for the age pension_** is to be worked out on the assumption that being an Australian resident were an additional qualification for an age pension.

             (9)  For the purposes of this section, if a person would otherwise have 2 or more dates of qualification for the age pension, only the first date is to be counted.

##### <a id="92J"></a>92J  Registration

             (1)  If an application is made in accordance with this Subdivision, the Secretary must register the applicant as a member of the pension bonus scheme.

             (2)  This section has effect subject to subsection 92F(2).

##### <a id="92K"></a>92K  Duration of membership

##### <a id="92L"></a>92L  Cancellation of membership

                   A person’s membership of the pension bonus scheme is cancelled if:

                     (c)  the person does not make a proper claim for a pension bonus when the person claims age pension; or

                     (d)  the person requests the Secretary, in writing, to cancel the person’s membership.

Note:          Subclause 8(3) of Schedule 5 to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act deals with income support supplement for carers.

##### <a id="92M"></a>92M  Application for registration is not to be treated as a claim

##### <a id="92R"></a>92R  Continuity of accruing membership is not broken by a period of non-accruing membership

                   If:

                     (a)  a person has been an accruing member of the pension bonus scheme for a continuous period (the **_first accruing membership period_**) (including a period that is applicable because of one or more applications of this section); and

                     (b)  the first accruing membership period is followed by a continuous period of non-accruing membership of the scheme; and

                     (c)  the period of non-accruing membership is followed by a further continuous period of accruing membership of the scheme (the **_second accruing membership period_**);

                      (f)  at such place as in specified in the invitation.

             (4)  If a claim for pension bonus is made in accordance with an invitation under subsection (3), this Part (other than this section) has effect as if the person had claimed the pension bonus at the same time as the person claimed age pension.

##### <a id="93M"></a>93M  Lodgment period for claim

             (1)  This section sets out rules for determining the period (the **_lodgment period_**) within which a claim for pension bonus must be made.

                   _Lodgment period where last bonus period is a full-year period_

             (2)  If a person’s last bonus period is a full-year period, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is the period of 13 weeks beginning at the end of that bonus period. However, this rule does not apply if:

                     (a)  the person is an exempt partnered person (see subsection (8)) as at the end of the person’s last bonus period; or

                     (b)  the person’s membership of the pension bonus scheme becomes non-accruing immediately after the end of the person’s last bonus period; or

                     (c)  the person is a post-75 member of the pension bonus scheme and has a post-75 work period (see subsection (9)).

Note:          For the rule in these cases, see subsections (5), (6) and (7).

                   _Lodgment period where last bonus period is a part-year period_

             (3)  If a person’s last bonus period is a part-year period, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is:

                     (a)  the period of 13 weeks beginning at the end of that bonus period; or

                     (b)  if the Secretary allows a longer period—that longer period.

However, this rule does not apply if:

                     (c)  the person is an exempt partnered person (see subsection (8)) as at the end of the person’s last bonus period; or

                     (d)  the person’s membership of the pension bonus scheme becomes non-accruing immediately after the end of the person’s last bonus period; or

                     (e)  the person is a post-75 member of the pension bonus scheme and has a post-75 work period (see subsection (9)).

Note:          For the rule in these cases, see subsections (5), (6) and (7).

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  subsection (3) applies to a person’s claim for pension bonus; and

                     (b)  the claim is lodged within a period allowed under paragraph (3)(b);

Division 6 has effect, in relation to the calculation of the amount of that pension bonus, as if the person had not accrued the part-year bonus period.

                   _Lodgment period for exempt partnered person_

             (5)  If a person is an exempt partnered person as at the end of the person’s last bonus period because the person is a member of a couple, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is the period:

                     (a)  beginning at the end of that bonus period; and

                     (b)  ending at:

                              (i)  the time of the last occasion on which the person’s partner could have lodged a claim for a pension bonus; or

                             (ii)  the end of the period of 13 weeks after the person ceases to be a member of the same couple (whether because of the death of the person’s partner or for any other reason);

                            whichever comes first.

                   _Lodgment period for non-accruing member_

             (6)  If a person’s membership of the pension bonus scheme becomes non-accruing immediately after the end of the person’s last bonus period, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is the period:

                     (a)  beginning at the end of the person’s last bonus period; and

                     (b)  ending 13 weeks after the time when the person’s membership of the scheme ceases to be non-accruing.

                   _Lodgment period for post-75 member who has a post-75 work period_

             (7)  If a post-75 member of the pension bonus scheme has a post-75 work period, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is the period of 13 weeks beginning at the end of the period nominated in the claim as the person’s post-75 work period.

                   _Exempt partnered person_

             (8)  For the purposes of this section, a person is an **_exempt partnered person_** at a particular time if, at that time, the person is a member of a couple, and:

                     (a)  the person’s partner is an accruing or non-accruing member of the pension bonus scheme; or

                     (b)  the person’s partner is an accruing or non-accruing member of the corresponding scheme under Part IIIAB of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.

                   _Post-75 member with a post-75 work period_

             (9)  For the purposes of this section, a post-75 member of the pension bonus scheme has a **_post-75 work period_** if:

                     (a)  the person’s claim for pension bonus nominates a particular period as the person’s post-75 work period; and

                     (b)  the nominated period begins immediately after the end of the person’s last bonus period; and

                     (c)  if it were assumed that the person had been an accruing member of the pension bonus scheme throughout each test period that is applicable to the person, the person would have passed the work test for each test period.

Note:          **_Test period_** is defined by subsection (10). 

           (10)  For the purposes of subsection (9), to work out what is a **_test period_**:

                     (a)  identify the **_extended period_**, which is that part of the nominated period when the person was neither:

                              (i)  subject to a compensation preclusion period or a carer preclusion period; nor

                             (ii)  covered by a declaration under section 92Q;

                     (b)  if the extended period is 365 days or less—the extended period is the only test period;

                     (c)  if the extended period is longer than 365 days—each of the following periods is a test period:

                              (i)  the full-year period beginning at the start of the extended period;

                             (ii)  if 2 or more succeeding full-year periods are included in the extended period—each of those full-year periods;

                            (iii)  the remainder (if any) of the extended period.

           (11)  In addition to its effect apart from this subsection, section 93B (evidentiary certificates) also has the effect it would have if each reference in paragraph 93B(1)(a), (2)(a), (3)(a) or (4)(a) to an accruing member of the pension bonus scheme were a reference to a post-75 member of the scheme.

                   _Last bonus period_

           (12)  For the purposes of this section, if a person has accrued only one full year bonus period, that period is the person’s **_last bonus period_**.

##### <a id="93N"></a>93N  Withdrawal of claim

             (1)  A claimant for a pension bonus may withdraw a claim that has not been determined.

             (2)  A claim that is withdrawn is taken not to have been made.

             (3)  A withdrawal may be made orally or in writing.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a person claims both a pension bonus and an age pension; and

                     (b)  the claim for age pension is withdrawn;

the claim for pension bonus is taken to have been withdrawn.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a person claims both a pension bonus and an age pension; and

                     (b)  the claim for age pension is rejected as a direct or indirect result of the operation of:

                              (i)  Division 2 of Part 3.12 (disposals of assets); or

                             (ii)  Part 3.14 (compensation);

the claim for pension bonus is taken to have been withdrawn.

### Division 8—Determination of claim

##### <a id="93P"></a>93P  Secretary to determine claim

             (1)  The Secretary must, in accordance with this Act, determine a claim for pension bonus.

             (2)  If a person claims both a pension bonus and an age pension, the Secretary must not determine the claim for pension bonus until the claim for age pension has been granted.

##### <a id="93Q"></a>93Q  Grant of claim

                   The Secretary must determine that a claim for pension bonus is to be granted if the Secretary is satisfied that the person is qualified for the pension bonus.

### Division 9—Payment of pension bonus

##### <a id="93R"></a>93R  Payment of pension bonus

                   If a claim for pension bonus is granted, the bonus is payable to the person concerned on:

                     (a)  the first pension payday after the grant; or

                     (b)  if the Secretary considers that it is not practicable to pay the bonus on that payday—the next practicable day.

##### <a id="93S"></a>93S  Payment of bonus after death

             (1)  This section sets out the only circumstances in which a pension bonus will be payable after the death of the person concerned.

Claim granted before death

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a person claims a pension bonus; and

                     (b)  the person dies; and

                     (c)  at the time of the person’s death, the claim had been granted, but the person had not received the bonus;

the bonus is payable to the legal personal representative of the person.

Claim not granted before death

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person claims a pension bonus; and

                     (b)  the person dies; and

                     (c)  at the time of the person’s death, the claim had not been determined;

then:

                     (d)  the Secretary must determine the claim after the person’s death as if the person had not died; and

                     (e)  if the claim is granted—the bonus is payable to the legal personal representative of the person.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  under paragraph (3)(d), the Secretary is required to determine a claim for pension bonus after a person’s death; and

                     (b)  at the time of the person’s death, the person’s claim for age pension had not been determined;

then, in determining the claim for pension bonus, this Part is modified as set out in the following table:

Liability of Commonwealth

             (5)  If a pension bonus is paid under subsection (2) or (3), the Commonwealth has no further liability to any person in respect of that bonus.

### Division 10—Protection of pension bonus

##### <a id="93T"></a>93T  Pension bonus to be absolutely inalienable

             (1)  A pension bonus is absolutely inalienable, whether by way of, or in consequence of, sale, assignment, charge, execution, bankruptcy or otherwise. This subsection has effect subject to subsections (2) and (3) and section 1359.

Deduction from bonus to pay tax debts that are unrelated to the bonus

             (2)  The Secretary may make a deduction from a pension bonus payable to a person if the person asks the Secretary:

                     (a)  to make the deduction; and

                     (b)  to pay the amount to be deducted to the Commissioner of Taxation.

Note 1:       The Secretary must make deductions from a person’s social security payment if requested by the Commissioner of Taxation—see section 1359.

Note 2:       Under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, pension bonus is exempt from income tax.

Deduction from bonus at recipient’s request

             (3)  The Secretary may make a deduction from a pension bonus payable to a person if the person consents under section 1234A to the Secretary making the deduction.

Note:          Section 1234A enables the Secretary to recover a debt from a person other than the debtor if the person is receiving a social security payment.

### Division 11—Preclusion periods

##### <a id="93U"></a>93U  Disposal preclusion period

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, if:

                     (a)  either:

                             (ii)  the partner of a person has, during a designated year of the person, disposed of an asset of the partner; and

                     (b)  the amount of that disposition, or the sum of that amount and of the amounts (if any) of other dispositions of assets previously made by the person and/or the person’s partner during that designated year, exceeds $10,000;

the person is subject to a **_disposal preclusion period_** throughout the period of 5 years that starts on the day on which the disposition referred to in paragraph (a) took place.

Note:          **_Designated year_** is defined by subsection (3).

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, if:

                     (a)  a person ceases to be a member of a couple (whether because of the death of the person’s partner or for any other reason); and

                     (b)  immediately before the cessation, the person was subject to a particular disposal preclusion period that arose wholly because the person’s partner disposed of a particular asset; and

                     (c)  if that disposition had been disregarded, the person would not have been subject to that disposal preclusion period;

then, despite subsection (1), that disposal preclusion period ends at the cessation.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a **_designated year_** of a person is:

                     (a)  the 12-month period ending on the day the person qualified for age pension; and

                     (b)  each preceding 12-month period; and

                     (c)  each succeeding 12-month period.

##### <a id="93V"></a>93V  Compensation preclusion period

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, if a person receives a lump sum compensation payment, the person is subject to a **_compensation preclusion period_** throughout the lump sum preclusion period.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, if a person receives a series of periodic compensation payments, the person is subject to a **_compensation preclusion period_** throughout the periodic payments period.

             (3)  This section applies to a payment even if it was received before the commencement of this section.

##### <a id="93W"></a>93W  Carer preclusion period

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, if a person receives:

                     (a)  a carer payment; or

                     (b)  a carer service pension; or

                     (c)  an income support supplement that is payable as a result of the operation of subclause 8(3) of Schedule 5 to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act;

during a particular period, the person is subject to a **_carer preclusion period_** throughout that period.

Note:          Subclause 8(3) of Schedule 5 to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act deals with income support supplement for carers.

             (2)  This section applies to a carer payment, a carer service pension or an income support supplement even if it was received before the commencement of this section.

                              (i)  those amounts; and 

                             (ii)  any amount deducted under paragraph (f) in respect of the debt or overpayment;

                            is equal to the debt or overpayment; or

                      (f)  if the social security payment is pension bonus—the payment of the bonus is to be reduced by so much of the debt or overpayment as does not exceed the bonus, even if this results in reducing the bonus to nil.

## 9  Subsection 1231(1A)

Omit “The Secretary”, substitute “If the social security payment is not pension bonus, the Secretary”.

                     (b)  ask the Secretary to assess the amount of the pension bonus that is to be paid to the person.

After “payment” (first occurring), insert “(other than pension bonus)”.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Division, if a person has accrued only 3 bonus periods, each of those bonus periods is a **_qualifying bonus period_**.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Division, if a person has accrued only 4 bonus periods, each of those bonus periods is a **_qualifying bonus period_**.

             (5)  For the purposes of this Division, if a person has accrued only 5 bonus periods, each of those bonus periods is a **_qualifying bonus period_**.

             (6)  For the purposes of this Division, if:

### Division 7—Claim for pension bonus

##### <a id="45UJ"></a>45UJ  Need for a claim

                   A person who wants to be granted a pension bonus must make a proper claim for the bonus.

##### <a id="45UK"></a>45UK  Proper claim

             (1)  To be a proper claim, a claim for pension bonus must be:

                     (a)  in writing; and

                     (b)  in accordance with a form approved by the Commission; and

                     (c)  either:

                              (i)  attached to a proper claim made by the person for a designated pension and lodged together with that claim; or

                             (ii)  made in accordance with an invitation under subsection (3); and

                     (d)  made within the applicable lodgment period (see section 45UL).

             (2)  A claim for pension bonus is a proper claim even though it is not certain whether the person will start to receive a designated pension at or after the time when the person makes the claim. The claim has effect as a claim that is contingent on the person receiving a designated pension.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a person makes a proper claim for a designated pension; and

                     (b)  the claim is in accordance with a form that does not require the claimant to disclose whether the claimant is a registered member of:

                              (i)  the pension bonus scheme; or

                             (ii)  the corresponding scheme under Part 2.2A of the Social Security Act; and

                     (c)  the person is, to the knowledge of the Secretary, registered as a member of the pension bonus scheme; and

                     (d)  a claim by the person for pension bonus is not attached to the claim for the designated pension;

the Secretary must give the claimant a written notice inviting the claimant to lodge a claim for a pension bonus:

                     (e)  within such period after the lodgment of the claim for the designated pension as is specified in the invitation; and

                      (f)  at such place as in specified in the invitation.

             (4)  If a claim for pension bonus is made in accordance with an invitation under subsection (3), this Part (other than this section) has effect as if the person had claimed the pension bonus at the same time as the person claimed the designated pension.

##### <a id="45UL"></a>45UL  Lodgment period for claim

             (1)  This section sets out rules for determining the period (the **_lodgment period_**) within which a claim for pension bonus must be made.

                   _Lodgment period where last bonus period is a full-year period_

             (2)  If a person’s last bonus period is a full-year period, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is the period of 13 weeks beginning at the end of that bonus period. However, this rule does not apply if:

                     (a)  the person is an exempt partnered person (see subsection (8)) as at the end of the person’s last bonus period; or

                     (b)  the person’s membership of the pension bonus scheme becomes non-accruing immediately after the end of the person’s last bonus period; or

                     (c)  the person is a post-70/75 member of the pension bonus scheme and has a post-70/75 work period (see subsection (9)).

Note:          For the rule in these cases, see subsections (5), (6) and (7).

                   _Lodgment period where last bonus period is a part-year period_

             (3)  If a person’s last bonus period is a part-year period, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is:

                     (a)  the period of 13 weeks beginning at the end of that bonus period; or

                     (b)  if the Commission allows a longer period—that longer period.

However, this rule does not apply if:

                     (c)  the person is an exempt partnered person (see subsection (8)) as at the end of the person’s last bonus period; or

                     (d)  the person’s membership of the pension bonus scheme becomes non-accruing immediately after the end of the person’s last bonus period; or

                     (e)  the person is a post-70/75 member of the pension bonus scheme and has a post-70/75 work period (see subsection (9)).

Note:          For the rule in these cases, see subsections (5), (6) and (7).

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  subsection (3) applies to a person’s claim for pension bonus; and

                     (b)  the claim is lodged within a period allowed under paragraph (3)(b);

Division 6 has effect, in relation to the calculation of the amount of that pension bonus, as if the person had not accrued the part-year bonus period.

                   _Lodgment period for exempt partnered person_

             (5)  If a person is an exempt partnered person as at the end of the person’s last bonus period because the person is a member of a couple, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is the period:

                     (a)  beginning at the end of that bonus period; and

                     (b)  ending at:

                              (i)  the time of the last occasion on which the person’s partner could have lodged a claim for a pension bonus; or

                             (ii)  the end of the period of 13 weeks after the person ceases to be a member of the same couple (whether because of the death of the person’s partner or for any other reason);

                            whichever comes first.

                   _Lodgment period for non-accruing member_

             (6)  If a person’s membership of the pension bonus scheme becomes non-accruing immediately after the end of the person’s last bonus period, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is the period:

                     (a)  beginning at the end of the person’s last bonus period; and

                     (b)  ending 13 weeks after the time when the person’s membership of the scheme ceases to be non-accruing.

                   _Lodgment period for post-70/75 member who has a post-70/75 work period_

             (7)  If a post-70/75 member of the pension bonus scheme has a post-70/75 work period, the **_lodgment period_** applicable to the person’s claim for pension bonus is the period of 13 weeks beginning at the end of the period nominated in the claim as the person’s post-70/75 work period.

                   _Exempt partnered person_

             (8)  For the purposes of this section, a person is an **_exempt partnered person_** at a particular time if, at that time, the person is a member of a couple, and:

                     (a)  the person’s partner is an accruing or non-accruing member of the pension bonus scheme; or

                     (b)  the person’s partner is an accruing or non-accruing member of the corresponding scheme under Part 2.2A of the Social Security Act.

                   _Post-70/75 member with a post-70/75 work period_

             (9)  For the purposes of this section, a post-70/75 member of the pension bonus scheme has a **_post-70/75 work period_** if:

                     (a)  the person’s claim for pension bonus nominates a particular period as the person’s post-70/75 work period; and

                     (b)  the nominated period begins immediately after the end of the person’s last bonus period; and

                     (c)  if it were assumed that the person had been an accruing member of the pension bonus scheme throughout each test period that is applicable to the person, the person would have passed the work test for each test period.

Note:          **_Test period_** is defined by subsection (10). 

           (10)  For the purposes of subsection (9), to work out what is a **_test period_**:

                     (a)  identify the **_extended period_**, which is that part of the nominated period when the person was neither:

                              (i)  subject to a carer preclusion period; nor

                             (ii)  covered by a declaration under section 45TO;

                     (b)  if the extended period is 365 days or less—the extended period is the only test period;

                     (c)  if the extended period is longer than 365 days—each of the following periods is a test period:

                              (i)  the full-year period beginning at the start of the extended period;

                             (ii)  if 2 or more succeeding full-year periods are included in the extended period—each of those full-year periods;

                            (iii)  the remainder (if any) of the extended period.

           (11)  In addition to its effect apart from this subsection, section 45U (evidentiary certificates) also has the effect it would have if each reference in paragraph 45U(1)(a), (2)(a), (3)(a) or (4)(a) to an accruing member of the pension bonus scheme were a reference to a post-70/75 member of the scheme.

                   _Last bonus period_

           (12)  For the purposes of this section, if a person has accrued only one full year bonus period, that period is the person’s **_last bonus period_**.

##### <a id="45UM"></a>45UM  Withdrawal of claim

             (1)  A claimant for a pension bonus may withdraw a claim that has not been determined.

             (2)  A claim that is withdrawn is taken not to have been made.

             (3)  A withdrawal may be made orally or in writing.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a person claims both a pension bonus and a designated pension; and

                     (b)  the claim for the designated pension is withdrawn;

the claim for pension bonus is taken to have been withdrawn.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  a person claims both a pension bonus and a designated pension; and

                     (b)  the claim for the designated pension is rejected as a direct or indirect result of the operation of Subdivision B of Division 11 of Part IIIB (disposals of assets);

the claim for pension bonus is taken to have been withdrawn.

### Division 8—Determination of claim

##### <a id="45UN"></a>45UN  Secretary to investigate claim and submit it to Commission

             (1)  If a person makes a proper claim for a pension bonus, the Secretary must cause an investigation to be made into the matters to which the claim relates.

             (2)  When the investigation is completed, the Secretary must cause the claim to be submitted to the Commission for consideration and determination.

             (3)  When the claim is submitted to the Commission, it must be accompanied by:

                     (a)  any evidence supplied by the claimant in support of the claim; and

                     (b)  any documents or other evidence obtained by the Department in the course of the investigation that are relevant to the claim; and

                     (c)  any other documents or other evidence under the control of the Department that are relevant to the claim.

##### <a id="45UO"></a>45UO  Commission to determine claim

             (1)  The Commission must, in accordance with this Act, determine a claim for pension bonus.

             (2)  If a person claims both a pension bonus and a designated pension, the Commission must not determine the claim for pension bonus until the claim for the designated pension has been granted.

##### <a id="45UP"></a>45UP  Grant of claim

                   The Commission must determine that a claim for pension bonus is to be granted if the Commission is satisfied that the person is qualified for the pension bonus.

### Division 9—Payment of pension bonus

             (5)  If a pension bonus is paid under subsection (2) or (3), the Commonwealth has no further liability to any person in respect of that bonus.

### Division 10—Protection of pension bonus

##### <a id="45US"></a>45US  Pension bonus to be absolutely inalienable

             (1)  A pension bonus is absolutely inalienable, whether by way of, or in consequence of, sale, assignment, charge, execution, bankruptcy or otherwise. This subsection has effect subject to subsections (2) and (3) and section 58J.

Deduction from bonus to pay tax debts that are unrelated to the bonus

             (2)  The Commission may make a deduction from a pension bonus payable to a person if the person asks the Commission:

                     (a)  to make the deduction; and

                     (b)  to pay the amount to be deducted to the Commissioner of Taxation.

Note 1:       The Commission must make deductions from a person’s pension or pension bonus if requested by the Commissioner of Taxation—see section 58J.

Note 2:       Under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, pension bonus is exempt from income tax.

Deduction from bonus at recipient’s request

             (3)  The Commission may make a deduction from a pension bonus payable to a person if the person consents under paragraph 205(2)(e) to the Commission making the deduction.

Note:          Paragraph 205(2)(e) enables the Commission to recover a debt from a person other than the debtor if the person is receiving a benefit under this Act.

### Division 11—Preclusion periods

##### <a id="45UT"></a>45UT  Disposal preclusion period

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, if:

                     (a)  either:

                             (ii)  the partner of a person has, during a designated year of the person, disposed of an asset of the partner; and

                     (b)  the amount of that disposition, or the sum of that amount and of the amounts (if any) of other dispositions of assets previously made by the person and/or the person’s partner during that designated year, exceeds $10,000;

the person is subject to a **_disposal preclusion period_** throughout the period of 5 years that starts on the day on which the disposition referred to in paragraph (a) took place.

                     (b)  immediately before the cessation, the person was subject to a particular disposal preclusion period that arose wholly because the person’s partner disposed of a particular asset; and

                     (c)  if that disposition had been disregarded, the person would not have been subject to that disposal preclusion period;

then, despite subsection (1), that disposal preclusion period ends at the cessation.

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, a **_designated year_** of a person is:

                     (a)  the 12-month period ending on the person’s special date of eligibility for a designated pension; and

                     (c)  income support supplement that is payable as a result of the operation of subclause 8(3) of Schedule 5;

during a particular period, the person is subject to a **_carer preclusion period_** throughout that period.
