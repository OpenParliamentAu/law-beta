             (1)  The functions of the Nomination Panel include:

                     (a)  to conduct a selection process for each appointment of a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(aa) or (b); and

                     (b)  to assess all applicants for the appointment against the selection criteria determined under subsection 43A(1) and any additional selection criteria notified under subsection 43A(2); and

                     (c)  to assess all applicants for the appointment on the basis of merit; and

                     (d)  to give a written report to the Minister on the outcome of the selection process that contains a list of at least 3 candidates who are nominated for the appointment and a comparative assessment of those candidates.

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the assessment of applicants for appointment as a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(aa) or (b) is based on merit if:

                     (a)  an assessment is made of the comparative suitability of the applicants for the duties of that Director, using a competitive selection process; and

                     (b)  the assessment is based on the relationship between the applicants’ experience, skills and competencies and the experience, skills and competencies genuinely required for the duties of that Director; and

                     (c)  the assessment focuses on the capability of the applicants to achieve outcomes related to the duties of that Director; and

                     (d)  the assessment is the primary consideration in nominating the candidates for that appointment.

Advertising appointments

             (3)  The Nomination Panel must invite written applications by persons seeking to be appointed as a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(aa) or (b) by advertisements published:

                     (a)  in either or both of the following:

                              (i)  a newspaper circulating generally throughout Australia;

                             (ii)  for each State, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory—a newspaper circulating generally in that State or Territory; and

                     (b)  on the Department’s website.

Selection process creates another appointment

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  under subsection (3), the Nomination Panel invites applications by persons seeking to be appointed as Chairperson (whether or not it also invites applications by persons seeking to be appointed as a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(b)); and

                     (b)  as a result of the selection process, a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(b) is appointed as the Chairperson (allowing another appointment (the **_new appointment_**) of a Director referred to in that paragraph to be made);

then:

                     (c)  the Panel is not required to conduct another selection process for the new appointment; and

                     (d)  if the Panel does not do so—paragraphs (1)(b), (c) and (d) of this section apply in relation to the new appointment as if:

                              (i)  the unsuccessful applicants (other than a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(b)) for the appointment as Chairperson were applicants for the new appointment; and

                             (ii)  if the Panel also invited applications by persons seeking to be appointed as a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(b)—the unsuccessful applicants for the appointment were applicants for the new appointment.

##### <a id="43A"></a>43A  Selection criteria

##### <a id="43B"></a>43B  Consultation, and selection of candidate not nominated by Nomination Panel

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the Nomination Panel gives the Minister a report under paragraph 43(1)(d) in relation to the appointment of a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(aa) or (b); and

                     (b)  the Minister considers that a person not nominated by the Nomination Panel should be appointed;

the Minister must give the Prime Minister a written notice that:

                     (d)  sets out the Minister’s reasons for preferring that person.

             (2)  If that person is so appointed, the Minister must table the reasons for that appointment in each House of the Parliament no later than 15 sitting days of that House after that appointment is made. Those reasons must include an assessment of that person against the selection criteria.

continues to have effect after the commencing time as if it had been done by the Finance Minister under the affected provision.

* * *

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 5  Application of Schedule 5 amendments

The repeals and amendments made by Schedule 5 apply to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

* * *

_Acts Interpretation Amendment Act 2011 (No. 46, 2011)_

## Schedule 3

## 10  Saving—appointments

The amendments made by Schedule 2 do not affect the validity of an appointment that was made under an Act before the commencement of this item and that was in force immediately before that commencement.

## 11  Transitional regulations

The Governor‑General may make regulations prescribing matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) relating to the amendments and repeals made by Schedules 1 and 2.

* * *

_National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 2012 (No. 112, 2012)_

The following provision commences on 24 January 2013 unless proclaimed earlier:

## Schedule 1

## 30  Application and transitional

(1)       The amendments made by items 24 and 25 apply in relation to appointments made after the commencement of those items.

(2)       Subject to subitem (3), the amendment made by item 26 applies in relation to appointments made before, on or after the commencement of that item (including because of subitem (4)).

(3)       For the person holding the position of Chairperson under the _Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991_ immediately before the commencement of this item, any period occurring before that commencement for which both of the following applied:

                     (a)  the person held an office referred to in paragraph 8(b) of that Act;

                     (b)  the person was not the Chairperson under that Act;

is to be disregarded for the purposes of subsection 18(3) of that Act (as inserted by this Act).

(4)       The person holding the position of Chairperson under the _Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991_ immediately before the commencement of this item is taken, on the commencement of this item, to have been appointed by the Governor‑General under section 17 of that Act as the Director referred to in paragraph 8(aa) of that Act:

                     (a)  for the balance of the person’s term of appointment that remained immediately before the commencement of this item; and

                     (b)  on the same terms and conditions as applied to the person immediately before the commencement of this item.

(5)       Subitem (4) does not prevent those terms and conditions being varied after the commencement of this item.

(6)       The amendments made by this Schedule do not affect the validity of an appointment of a person as a non‑executive Director referred to in paragraph 8(b) of the _Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991_ that was made before the commencement of this item.

* * *

_Statute Law Revision Act 2012 (No. 136, 2012)_

## Schedule 6

## 72  Saving

Despite the repeal of Part 10 of the _Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991_ made by this Schedule, that Part, as in force immediately before the commencement of this item, continues to apply on and after that commencement as if that repeal had not happened.
