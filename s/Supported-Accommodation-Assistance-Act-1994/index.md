## An Act relating to financial assistance to the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory in connection with the jointly-funded program known as the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (“SAAP”), and for related purposes

Preamble

This Preamble sets out considerations taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows.

The Parliament recognises the need to redress social inequalities and to achieve a reduction in poverty and the amelioration of the consequences of poverty for individuals.

Homeless people form one of the most powerless and marginalised groups in society. Responses to their needs should aim to empower them and to maximise their independence. These responses should be provided in a way that respects their dignity as individuals, enhances their self-esteem, is sensitive to their social and economic circumstances, and respects their cultural backgrounds and their beliefs.

Australia has acted to protect the rights of all of its citizens, including people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, by recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms through:

      (a)    the ratification of the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights; and

      (b)    the ratification of the Conventions on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and on the Rights of the Child; and

      (c)    the acceptance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women; and

      (d)    the enactment of legislation such as the _Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986_.

Legislation relating to homeless people should include a focus on the provision of appropriate support to meet the individual needs of the clients of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (“SAAP”) and on their right to an equitable share of the community’s resources.

It is essential then that the community has the opportunity to be involved in the development of policies relating to, or impacting on, people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Accordingly, the Parliament intends that, under the law that follows, the Minister should establish an advisory committee drawn from members of the community with:

      (a)    relevant expertise in, or experience of, homelessness; or

      (b)    an understanding of the principal issues affecting homeless people; or

      (c)    other relevant expertise or experience.

The Parliament intends that the Commonwealth Government should work co-operatively with State and Territory governments to ensure that people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness are given opportunities to redress their circumstances and that their universal human rights are not prejudiced by the manner in which services are provided to them.

The Parliament of Australia enacts:
