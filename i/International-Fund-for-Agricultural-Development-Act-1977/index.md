 (a)	The resources of the Fund shall be used to achieve the objective specified in Article 2.

 Within the framework of the above-mentioned priorities, eligibility for assistance shall be on the basis of objective economic and social criteria with special emphasis on the needs of the low income countries and their potential for increasing food production, as well as due regard to a fair geographic distribution in the use of such resources.
 (e)	Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, financing by the Fund shall be governed by broad policies, criteria and regulations laid down, from time to time, by the Governing Council by a two-thirds majority of the total number of votes.

 (b)	The proportion of the Fund's resources to be committed in any financial year for financing operations in either of the forms referred to in subsection&#160;(a) shall be decided from time to time by the Executive Board with due regard to the long-term viability of the Fund and the need for continuity in its operations.

 (c)	The President shall submit projects and programmes to the Executive Board for consideration and approval.
 (d)	Decisions with regard to the selection and approval of projects and programmes shall be made by the Executive Board. Such decisions shall be made on the basis of the broad policies, criteria and regulations established by the Governing Council.
 (e)	For the appraisal of projects and programmes presented to it for financing, the Fund shall, as a general rule, use the services of international institutions and may, where appropriate, use the services of other competent agencies specialized in this field. Such institutions and agencies shall be selected by the Executive Board after consultation with the recipient concerned and shall be directly responsible to the Fund in performing the appraisal.

Such institutions shall be of a world-wide or regional character and shall be selected in each case with the approval of the recipient. Before submitting the loan to the Executive Board for approval, the Fund shall assure itself that the institution to be entrusted with the supervision agrees with the results of the appraisal of the project or programme concerned. This shall be arranged between the Fund and the institution or agency in charge of the appraisal as well as with the institution to be entrusted with the supervision.
 (h)	For the purposes of subsections&#160;(f) and (g) above, references to "loans" shall be deemed to include "grants".
 (i)	The Fund may extend a line of credit to a national development agency to provide and administer subloans for the financing of projects and programmes 
<center>Back to Top</center>
 within the terms of the loan agreement and the framework agreed to by the Fund. Before the Executive Board approves the extension of such a line of credit, the national development agency concerned and its programme shall be appraised in accordance with the provisions of subsection&#160;(e). Implementation of the said programme shall be subject to supervision by the institutions selected in accordance with the provisions of subsection&#160;(g).
 (j)	The Executive Board shall adopt suitable regulations for procuring goods and services to be financed from the resources of the Fund. Such regulations shall, as a general rule, conform to the principles of international competitive bidding and shall give appropriate preference to experts, technicians and supplies from developing countries.

 In the case of a dispute between the Fund and a State that has ceased to be a Member, or between the Fund and any Member upon the termination of the operations of the Fund, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration by a tribunal of three arbitrators. One of the arbitrators shall be appointed by the Fund, another by the Member or former Member concerned and the two parties shall appoint the third arbitrator, who shall be the Chairman. If within 45 days of receipt of the request for arbitration either party has not appointed an arbitrator, or if within 30 days of the appointment of two arbitrators the third arbitrator has not been appointed, either party may request the President of the International Court of Justice, or such other authority as may have been prescribed by regulations adopted by the Governing Council, to appoint an arbitrator. The procedure of the arbitration shall be fixed by the arbitrators, but the Chairman shall have full power to settle all questions of procedure in any case of disagreement with respect thereto. A majority vote of the arbitrators shall be sufficient to reach a decision, which shall be final and binding upon the parties.
