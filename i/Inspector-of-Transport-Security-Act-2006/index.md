## Part 2—Objects and overview of Act

### Division 1—Objects

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Objects

             (1)  The object of this Act is to improve the security of transport and security regulated offshore facilities by providing for independent inquiry into transport security matters and offshore security matters.

             (2)  It is also an object of this Act that, during an inquiry into a matter, the Inspector will not interfere with the investigations of another government agency, or a coronial inquiry, into the matter.

             (3)  It is not an object of this Act:

                     (a)  to apportion blame in relation to a matter; or

                     (b)  to provide the means to determine the liability of any person in relation to a matter; or

                     (c)  to allow any adverse inference to be drawn from the fact that a person is the subject of an inquiry into a matter.

### Division 2—Overview

##### <a id="10"></a>10  General overview of Act

             (1)  This Act provides for the appointment of an Inspector of Transport Security to inquire into transport security matters and offshore security matters.

             (2)  The Inspector may only inquire into such matters in accordance with a direction from the Minister.

             (3)  The Inspector is given the powers necessary to conduct an inquiry. These include powers in relation to the gathering of information (see Part 5).

             (4)  Once an inquiry is completed, the Inspector must give the Minister a final report setting out his or her conclusions and recommendations, having taken into account submissions made on any draft report (see Divisions 3 and 4 of Part 6).

             (5)  If, during the course of an inquiry, the Inspector concludes that a matter demonstrates no security issue, the Inspector must give the Minister an interim report setting out that conclusion  and the Minister must revoke the direction under which the inquiry has been conducted (see Division 2 of Part 6).

             (6)  The confidentiality of information gathered by the Inspector in the course of an inquiry is protected by limiting the circumstances in which the information may be copied, recorded, used or disclosed (see Parts 5, 6, 7 and 8).

             (7)  The “no blame” nature of the Inspector’s inquiry (see subsection 9(3)) is reinforced by provisions that limit the admissibility of reports and the use of draft reports in disciplinary proceedings.

## Part 3—Inquiries

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Minister may initiate inquiry

             (1)  Subject to this Part, the Minister may direct the Inspector to inquire into a transport security matter or an offshore security matter.

Note:          Under subsection 33(3) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_, the Minister may vary or revoke such a direction.

             (2)  The direction must be in writing.

             (3)  The direction may specify the period within which the Inspector must give a final report.

             (4)  The direction is not a legislative instrument.

             (5)  The Inspector is not otherwise subject to direction from the Minister in relation to the inquiry, or any interim, draft or final report in relation to the inquiry.

             (6)  The Inspector is not subject to direction from the Secretary in relation to the inquiry, or any interim, draft or final report in relation to the inquiry.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  What is a _transport security matter_?

                   A **_transport security matter_** is:

                     (a)  an incident occurring in the course of transport, or involving a transport vehicle, that:

                              (i)  the Minister believes on reasonable grounds to be a major incident; and

                             (ii)  demonstrates, or may demonstrate, a problem with the security of transport; or

                     (b)  a state of affairs that suggests, or may suggest, a systemic failure or weakness in the way in which the security of transport is regulated; or

                     (c)  any other occurrence, circumstance, state of affairs or matter that:

                              (i)  the Minister believes on reasonable grounds to be significant; and

## Part 6—Reports

### Division 1—Simplified outline

##### <a id="50"></a>50  Simplified outline

                   The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

* * *

Once an inquiry is completed, the Inspector must make a report to the Minister setting out his or her conclusions and recommendations.

However, before making that final report, the Inspector must give anyone who would be adversely affected by the publication of the report the opportunity to comment on a draft. The Inspector may also release a draft report to another person for the purpose of allowing submissions to be made or advance notice of the contents of the final report to be given.

Some kinds of particularly sensitive information cannot be disclosed in this way.

A person who receives a draft report is allowed to copy, record, use and disclose the report for the purpose of making a submission or remedying a security deficiency identified in the report.

To facilitate frank submissions being given on the draft report, certain immunities are given to those who act honestly and reasonably in making those submissions.

A person cannot be subjected to disciplinary action on the basis of a draft report.

The final report can contain any of the information given to the Inspector in the course of his or her inquiry. However, there are limits on the circumstances in which the Minister may disclose information contained in the report, particularly sensitive information.

If, in the course of an inquiry, the Inspector forms the view that a matter into which he or she is conducting an inquiry demonstrates no significant problem in, and has no significant implications for, the security of transport or security regulated offshore facilities, the Inspector must make a report to this effect to the Minister. This is an interim report.

As a result of an interim report, the direction under which the inquiry is being conducted will be revoked, and so the inquiry will come to an end.

Reports are not admissible in proceedings.

* * *

### Division 2—Interim reports

##### <a id="51"></a>51  Interim report—no security issue found

             (1)  If, in the course of an inquiry conducted in accordance with a direction of the Minister under section 11, it becomes apparent to the Inspector that a transport security matter or an offshore security matter demonstrates no significant problem in, and has no significant implications for, the security of transport or security regulated offshore facilities, the Inspector must give an interim report to the Minister setting out his or her conclusions.

             (2)  The Minister must, as soon as practicable after receiving the interim report, revoke the direction under which the inquiry is being conducted.

             (3)  Nothing in this section affects the power of the Minister to revoke or amend a direction under section 11 for any other reason.

             (4)  The Inspector may include protected information, OBR information, CVR information, and restricted information given to the Inspector by the Executive Director, in the interim report.

                     (a)  the criminal proceeding is in relation to an alleged offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for more than 2 years; and

                     (b)  the disclosure of the information is necessary to establish a chain of dealing with evidence.

             (6)  If the court or coroner is satisfied that any adverse impact that the disclosure of the information might have on any current or future inquiry under this Act is outweighed by the public interest in the administration of justice, the court or coroner may order such disclosure.

             (7)  The court or coroner may direct that the restricted information, or any information obtained from the restricted information, must not:

                     (a)  be published or communicated to any person; or

                     (b)  be published or communicated except in such manner, and to such person, as the court or coroner specifies.

             (8)  If a person is prohibited by this section from disclosing restricted information, then:

                     (a)  the person cannot be required by a court or coroner to disclose the information; and

                     (b)  any information disclosed by the person in contravention of this section is not admissible in any proceedings (other than proceedings against the person under this section).

             (2)  The person may copy, make a record of, use or disclose the information, despite any other law.

Note:          This section constitutes authorisation for the purposes of other laws, such as paragraph (1)(d) of Information Privacy Principle 11 in section 14 of the _Privacy Act 1988_.

             (3)  The person is not liable:

                     (a)  to any proceedings for contravening any other law because of that conduct; or

                     (b)  to civil proceedings for loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person because of that conduct; or

                     (b)  the offence is an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for more than 2 years; and

                     (c)  the information may be relevant to the prevention of the offence.

             (2)  The application may be made in writing or, if the Inspector thinks it is necessary because of urgent circumstances, by telephone.

             (3)  The application must be accompanied by:

                     (a)  a statement by the Inspector, or a delegate of the Inspector, of his or her grounds for suspecting that an offence of the kind mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) is imminent; and

                     (b)  a statement by the Inspector, or a delegate of the Inspector, explaining why the information may be relevant to the prevention of the offence; and

                     (c)  a statement by the Executive Director, or a delegate of the Executive Director, that, in his or her opinion, the effect that the disclosure may have on current or future investigations under the _Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003_ is outweighed by the public interest served by disclosing the information to the agency or court; and

                     (d)  the proposed terms of the order.

             (4)  If the application is made in writing, the accompanying statements and the proposed terms of the order must be in writing.

             (5)  If the application is made by telephone:

                     (a)  the accompanying statements may be given by telephone, provided the person making the statement gives the Judge or AAT member to whom the statement is made, on the next day after the statement is made that is not a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in the place where it is made, an affidavit containing:

                             (ii)  a statement that the copy is a true record of the statement made to the Judge or AAT member by telephone; and

                     (c)  the Inspector must inform the Judge or AAT member to whom the application is made of the urgent circumstances on the basis of which the Inspector believes a telephone application is necessary.

                     (b)  having regard to the following matters, it is appropriate to make the order:

                              (i)  the extent to which the privacy of any person may be affected by the disclosure;

                             (ii)  the seriousness of the offence;

                            (iii)  the likelihood that the disclosure of the information would assist the agency in the prevention of the offence;

                            (iv)  the likelihood that the offence would be prevented without the disclosure of the information to the agency;

                             (v)  the effect that the disclosure may have on current or future investigations under the _Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003_.

             (7)  The order may include conditions or restrictions on the disclosure of the information.

                             (ii)  the day on which it was made; and

                            (iii)  the time at which it was made; and

                     (b)  give the order to the Inspector or delegate.

             (9)  The government agency to which information is disclosed on the order of the Judge or AAT member must not copy, make a record of, use or disclose the information for any purpose that is not related to the prevention of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for more than 2 years.

           (10)  The Judge or AAT member may copy, make a record of, use or disclose any information given to the Judge or AAT member under this section for the purposes of exercising the powers under this section.

## Part 9—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="80"></a>80  Inspector to minimise disruption to transport

                   In exercising powers and performing functions under this Act, the Inspector must have regard to the desirability of minimising any resulting disruption to:

                     (a)  transport by means of transport vehicles; and

                     (b)  the operation of security regulated offshore facilities.

##### <a id="81"></a>81  Inspector to act consistently with Australia’s international obligations

                   The Inspector, and each delegate of the Inspector, must exercise the Inspector’s powers and perform the Inspector’s functions under this Act in a manner that is consistent with Australia’s obligations under international agreements (as in force from time to time) that are identified by the regulations for the purposes of this section.

##### <a id="82"></a>82  Delegation

             (1)  The Inspector may, by writing, delegate all or any of the Inspector’s powers and functions to:

                     (a)  an SES employee; or

                     (b)  a person who holds or performs the duties of an APS Executive Level 1 or 2 position or an equivalent position; or

                     (c)  a person who:

                              (i)  is engaged by the Commonwealth, under contract or otherwise, to exercise powers, or perform functions, of the Inspector under this Act; and

                             (ii)  satisfies the criteria prescribed by the regulations.

             (2)  The Executive Director may, by writing, delegate all or any of the Executive Director’s powers and functions under this Act to:

                     (a)  an SES employee; or

                     (b)  a person who holds or performs the duties of an APS Executive Level 1 or 2 position or an equivalent position.

##### <a id="83"></a>83  States and Territories may confer powers and functions on Inspector

             (1)  A law of a State or Territory may confer powers and functions on the Inspector.

             (2)  In enacting subsection (1), it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution.

             (3)  To the extent that the Inspector has a power or function that is conferred, or taken to be conferred, by the law of a State or Territory:

                     (a)  that power or function is not taken to be conferred by Commonwealth law; and

                     (b)  subsection (1) is not taken to authorise the conferral of the power or function;

if the conferral or authorisation would contravene a constitutional doctrine restricting the powers and functions that may be conferred on authorities or officers of the Commonwealth, or would otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

             (4)  If, to ensure the validity of the conferral of a power or function purportedly conferred on the Inspector by a law of a State or Territory, it is necessary that the power or function be conferred by a law of the Commonwealth, rather than by a law of a State, the power or function is taken to be conferred by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.

             (5)  If, because of subsection (4), this Act is taken to confer a power or function upon the Inspector, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the conferral of the power or function.

             (6)  Subsections (4) and (5) do not limit subsection (1).

                            (iv)  that the Inspector honestly and reasonably believes is permitted, either expressly or by implication, to be done under this Act;
