### Division 3—General principles relating to industry code and industry standard

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Statement of regulatory policy

             (1)  The Parliament intends that a body or association that the ACMA is satisfied represents Internet service providers should develop a single code (**_industry code_**) that:

                     (a)  is to apply to Internet service providers; and

                     (b)  deals exclusively with the designated Internet gambling matters.

             (2)  The Parliament intends that an industry code developed, or industry standard determined, under this Part is to be in addition to any codes developed, or standards determined, under Schedule 5 or 7 to the _Broadcasting Services Act 1992_.

             (3)  The Parliament intends that this Part does not, by implication, limit the matters that may be dealt with by any codes developed, or standards determined, under Schedule 5 or 7 to the _Broadcasting Services Act 1992_.

             (4)  The Parliament intends that the ACMA should make reasonable efforts to ensure that either:

                     (a)  an industry code is registered under this Part before Part 3 commences; or

                     (b)  an industry standard is registered under this Part before Part 3 commences.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Matters that must be dealt with by industry code and industry standard

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to set out the matters to be dealt with by an industry code or industry standard.

Matters that must be dealt with by industry code or industry standard

             (2)  The Parliament intends that, for Internet service providers, there should be:

                     (a)  an industry code or an industry standard that deals with; or

                     (b)  an industry code and an industry standard that together deal with;

the designated Internet gambling matters.

Designated alternative access-prevention arrangements

             (3)  An industry code or an industry standard may provide that an Internet service provider is not required to deal with Internet content notified under paragraph 24(1)(b) or section 26 by taking steps to prevent particular end-users from accessing the content if access by the end-users is subject to an arrangement that is declared by the code or standard to be a designated alternative access-prevention arrangement for the purposes of the application of this section to those end-users.

             (4)  An industry code developed by a body or association must not declare that a specified arrangement is a designated alternative access-prevention arrangement for the purposes of the application of this section to one or more specified end-users unless the body or association is satisfied that the arrangement is likely to provide a reasonably effective means of preventing access by those end-users to prohibited Internet gambling content.

Note:          For specification by class, see subsection 46(2) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (5)  An industry standard determined by the ACMA must not declare that a specified arrangement is a designated alternative access-prevention arrangement for the purposes of the application of this section to one or more specified end-users unless the ACMA is satisfied that the arrangement is likely to provide a reasonably effective means of preventing access by those end-users to prohibited Internet gambling content.

Note:          For specification by class, see subsection 46(2) of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

             (6)  The following are examples of arrangements that could be declared to be designated alternative access-prevention arrangements:

                     (a)  an arrangement that involves the use of regularly updated Internet content filtering software;

                     (b)  an arrangement that involves the use of a filtered Internet carriage service.

             (7)  For the purposes of this Act, if an industry code:

                     (a)  deals to any extent with procedures to be followed by Internet service providers in dealing with Internet content notified under paragraph 24(1)(b) or section 26; and

                     (b)  makes provision as mentioned in subsection (3);

then:

                     (c)  the code is taken to deal with the matter set out in paragraph 35(b); and

                     (d)  the code is taken to be consistent with subsection (2).

             (8)  For the purposes of this Act, if an industry standard:

                     (a)  deals to any extent with procedures to be followed by Internet service providers in dealing with Internet content notified under paragraph 24(1)(b) or section 26; and

the advertisement is not an interactive gambling service advertisement for the purposes of this Part.

                              (i)  an interactive gambling service; or

                             (ii)  an interactive gambling service provider; and

                     (b)  the manufacturer, distributor or retailer of the product, or the provider of the service, is not associated in any way with the interactive gambling service provider concerned;
