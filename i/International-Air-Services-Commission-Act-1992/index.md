## Part 2—Key provisions

##### <a id="6"></a>6  The International Air Services Commission

             (1)  The International Air Services Commission is established.

             (2)  The functions of the Commission are:

                     (a)  to make determinations under sections 7 and 8; and

                     (b)  to conduct reviews of those determinations; and

                     (c)  to provide advice to the Minister about any matter referred to the Commission by the Minister concerning international air operations.

          (2A)  To remove any doubt, it is declared that the Commission may, at the same time, consider and decide more than one matter in relation to particular capacity.

             (3)  In performing its functions, the Commission must:

                     (a)  comply with any applicable policy statements made by the Minister under section 11; and

                     (b)  have regard to Australia’s international obligations concerning the operation of international air services.

             (4)  The Commission has the power to do everything necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Determinations allocating capacity

             (1)  The Commission may make a determination allocating available capacity.

             (2)  The determination:

                     (a)  must not allocate available capacity unless the Commission is satisfied that the allocation would be of benefit to the public; and

                    (aa)  must not allocate available capacity contrary to any restrictions on capacity contained in a bilateral arrangement, or a combination of bilateral arrangements, permitting the carriage to which the capacity relates; and

                     (b)  if more than one application was made under Division 1 of Part 3 relating to the allocation—must make the allocation that the Commission is satisfied, having regard to the applications made, would be of the greatest benefit to the public.

             (3)  In assessing the benefit to the public of an allocation of capacity, the Commission must apply the criteria set out for that purpose in the policy statements made by the Minister under section 11.

Note:          Division 1 of Part 3 is about making determinations. Part 4 is about the Commission’s procedure.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Renewal of determinations

             (1)  The Commission may, at any time while a determination is in force, make a fresh determination allocating the capacity to which the original determination relates.

             (2)  The fresh determination:

                     (a)  must make the same allocation of capacity as the original determination unless:

                              (i)  the Commission is satisfied that that allocation is no longer of benefit to the public; or

                             (ii)  the original determination is an interim determination; and

                     (b)  comes into force immediately after the end of the period during which the original determination was in force.

             (3)  If the fresh determination does not make the same allocation of capacity as the original determination, it must not make a different allocation of capacity unless the Commission is satisfied that that allocation would be of benefit to the public.

             (4)  In assessing the benefit to the public of an allocation of capacity, the Commission must apply the criteria set out for that purpose in any policy statements made by the Minister under section 11.

Note:          Division 2 of Part 3 is about renewing determinations. Part 4 is about the Commission’s procedure.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Effect of determinations on the making of operational decisions

             (1)  The Secretary must not make an operational decision in relation to capacity that is inconsistent with a determination relating to the allocation of that capacity.

             (2)  The Secretary must not make an operational decision in relation to capacity that comes into existence on or after 1 July 1992 unless:

                     (a)  a determination is in force relating to the allocation of that capacity; or

                     (b)  the capacity relates to a non‑scheduled flight within the meaning of the _Air Navigation Act 1920_; or

                     (c)  the decision is made in other circumstances prescribed by the regulations.

          (2A)  An operational decision made in relation to capacity as mentioned in paragraph (2)(c) is not taken to be an operational decision for the purposes of subsection 5(1).

             (3)  Nothing in this Act obliges the Secretary to make an operational decision implementing a determination.

Note:          Section 50 imposes notification requirements on the Secretary.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Review of determinations

             (1)  The Commission may, at any time, conduct a review of a determination if it believes that there may be grounds for varying, suspending or revoking the determination.

             (2)  The Commission must conduct a review of a determination if an Australian carrier to whom the determination allocates capacity applies to the Commission under section 21 for the determination to be varied.

Note:          Division 3 of Part 3 is about reviewing determinations. Part 4 is about the Commission’s procedure.

##### <a id="11"></a>11  Policy statements

             (1)  The Minister may, by legislative instrument, make policy statements about the way in which the Commission is to perform its functions.

             (2)  In particular, the policy statements may set out:

                     (a)  the criteria to be applied by the Commission in assessing the benefit to the public of allocations of capacity; and

                     (b)  how the Commission is to fix the periods during which determinations are to be in force; and

                     (c)  matters relating to the Commission’s consideration of whether determinations should be interim determinations; and

                     (d)  matters relating to the inclusion of conditions in determinations and the variation or revocation of such conditions.

             (3)  Without limiting the criteria that, under paragraph (2)(a), may be set out in the policy statements, the policy statements may set out:

                     (a)  criteria that relate to the matters referred to in section 3; and

                     (b)  criteria that apply in relation to particular circumstances, including where:

                              (i)  capacity is not limited under bilateral arrangements; or

                             (ii)  only one application has been made for the allocation of capacity; or

                            (iii)  no submissions are received opposing allocation of capacity to an applicant; or

                            (iv)  an application for the allocation of capacity is opposed on particular grounds.

             (4)  A policy statement:

                     (a)  must not deal with the making of a particular determination or decision by the Commission; and

                     (b)  is invalid to the extent that it purports to deal with such a matter.

## Part 3—Allocation of available capacity

### Division 1—Determinations allocating capacity

_Note:       This Division is about making determinations under section 7._

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Applications relating to available capacity

             (1)  Before making a determination allocating available capacity, the Commission must, by notice, invite:

                     (a)  applications for a determination allocating the capacity; and

                     (b)  if the regulations so require—submissions about the allocation of the capacity.

Note:          Section 52 is about publication of notices.

             (2)  Without limiting the matters that may be included in the notice, the notice must:

                     (c)  may include guidance as to:

                              (i)  any matters that the Commission considers to be particularly important in making its determination in relation to that available capacity; and

                             (ii)  the weight that the Commission is likely to give to such matters.

             (3)  Any person may apply to the Commission for a determination allocating the capacity.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Requirements of applications

             (1)  An application under this Division:

                     (a)  must be in writing; and

                     (b)  must be delivered at the address specified in the regulations as the Commission’s address for receiving applications; and

                     (d)  must comply with the requirements of form and content referred to in subsection (2).

             (2)  The regulations may impose requirements as to the form and content of such applications.

             (3)  The Commission may reject an application without considering it further if it does not comply with subsection (1).

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Content of determinations

             (1)  A determination may include such terms and conditions as the Commission thinks fit.

             (2)  Without limiting subsection (1), the determination:

                     (a)  must specify the period, under subsection (3), during which the determination is to be in force; and

                     (b)  may include a statement to the effect that the determination is an interim determination; and

                     (c)  must include a condition that the capacity be fully used, except so far as:

                              (i)  the determination provides otherwise in relation to a specified period commencing when the determination comes into force; or

                             (ii)  the regulations otherwise permit; and

                     (d)  must include a condition that, except to the extent permitted by the condition referred to in paragraphs (e) and (ea), the available capacity in question is only to be used by the one or more Australian carriers to whom the capacity is allocated; and

                     (e)  must include a condition stating the extent (if any) to which any such carrier may use that capacity by providing joint international air services with another Australian carrier or any other person; and

                    (ea)  may include a condition that, to the extent that any of the capacity is allocated to a particular Australian carrier, it may be used in whole or in part by any one or more of the following:

                              (i)  the carrier;

                             (ii)  a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the carrier;

                            (iii)  if the carrier is a wholly‑owned subsidiary of another Australian carrier—that other carrier; and

                      (f)  must include a condition stating the extent to which changes in the ownership or control of any such carrier are permitted while the determination is in force.

          (2A)  If a determination includes a condition of a kind mentioned in paragraph (2)(ea), the determination may include conditions that are applicable to all, or some only, of the persons who are permitted to use the capacity concerned.

          (2B)  If:

                     (a)  a carrier is a wholly‑owned subsidiary of another Australian carrier; and

                     (b)  that other carrier would, apart from any condition included under this subsection in a determination, be permitted by a condition referred to in paragraph (2)(ea) to use any capacity allocated to the subsidiary;

the determination must include a condition stating the extent to which changes in the ownership or control of that other carrier are permitted if that other carrier is to continue to be permitted to use that capacity while the determination is in force.

             (3)  The period referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is:

                     (a)  if the policy statements made by the Minister under section 11 set out how the period is to be fixed—the period as so fixed; or

                     (b)  in any other case:

                              (i)  if the determination is an interim determination—3 years; or

                             (ii)  if the determination is not an interim determination—5 years.

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Notification of determinations

                   As soon as practicable after the making of a determination, the Commission must:

                     (a)  make copies of the determination and its reasons for the determination available to the public; and

                     (b)  publish, in such manner as it thinks appropriate, a notice stating:

                              (i)  that the determination has been made; and

                             (ii)  where copies of the determination and reasons may be obtained.

### Division 2—Renewal of determinations

_Note:       This Division is about renewing determinations under section 8._

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Consideration of renewals

             (1)  The Commission must start its consideration of the renewal of a determination (other than an interim determination) at least 12 months before the end of the period during which the determination is in force.

             (2)  Sections 12 and 14 apply in relation to the renewal of a determination in the same way they apply in relation to the making of a determination allocating available capacity.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Renewal of interim determinations

             (1)  The Commission must start its consideration of the renewal of an interim determination as soon as practicable after the determination is made.

             (2)  Sections 12 and 14 apply in relation to the renewal of an interim determination in the same way they apply in relation to the making of a determination under section 7 allocating available capacity.

             (3)  If no applications are made under subsection 12(3) (as it applies by virtue of subsection (2) of this section) in relation to the interim determination, the Commission must issue a notice stating that:

                     (a)  no such applications were made; and

                     (b)  the determination is no longer to be treated as an interim determination.

Note:          Section 52 is about publication of notices.

             (4)  If such a notice is issued, this Act (including paragraph 15(3)(b) or 19(2)(b), as the case requires) has effect in relation to the determination as if it is no longer an interim determination.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Content of determinations

             (1)  A determination under section 8:

                     (a)  must specify the period, under subsection (2), during which the determination is to be in force; and

                     (b)  may include a statement to the effect that the determination is an interim determination; and

                     (c)  subject to subsection (3), must include the same terms and conditions as the original determination to which it relates.

             (2)  The period referred to in paragraph (1)(a) is:

                     (a)  if the policy statements made by the Minister under section 11 set out how the period is to be fixed—the period as so fixed; or

                     (b)  in any other case:

                              (i)  if the determination is an interim determination—3 years; or

                             (ii)  if the determination is not an interim determination—5 years.

             (3)  In including terms and conditions in the determination, the Commission may make such changes (if any) to the terms and conditions included in the original determination (including adding or deleting terms and conditions) as it is satisfied are warranted because of changes in circumstances since the original determination was made.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Notification of renewals

                   As soon as practicable after the making of a determination, the Commission must:

                     (a)  make copies of the determination and its reasons for the determination available to the public; and
