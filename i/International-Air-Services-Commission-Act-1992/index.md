		This Act may be cited as the International Air Services Commission Act 1992.
2  Commencement
		This Act commences on 1 July 1992.
3  Object of Act
		The object of this Act is to enhance international air services by fostering:
	(a)	greater economic efficiency in the airline industry, and increased competition between Australian carriers; and
	(b)	increased responsiveness by airlines to the needs of consumers, including an increased range of choices and benefits; and
	(c)	Australian tourism and trade; and
	(d)	the maintenance of Australian carriers capable of competing effectively with airlines of foreign countries.
4  Interpretation
	(1)	In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:
another country includes any region:
	(a)	that is part of a foreign country; or

	(c)	an Australian carrier that, under the determination, is to use capacity to which the determination relates no longer intends to use fully that capacity.
	(3)	The Commission must not make a decision varying the determination in a way that varies, or has the effect of varying, an allocation of capacity unless the Commission is satisfied that the allocation, as so varied, would be of benefit to the public.
24  Decisions on applications for variation
	(1)	Subject to this section, the Commission must, having conducted a review to decide an application (other than a transfer application) for a determination to be varied, make a decision:
	(a)	confirming the determination; or
	(b)	varying the determination in a way that gives effect to the variation requested in the application.
	(2)	Subject to subsection (3), the Commission must not make a decision varying the determination in a way that varies, or has the effect of varying, an allocation of capacity unless the Commission is satisfied that the allocation, as so varied, would be of benefit to the public.
	(3)	If:
	(a)	an Australian carrier to which a determination allocates capacity applies in accordance with section 21 for the determination to be varied; and
	(b)	the only effect of the variation would be to reduce the capacity allocated to the carrier;
the Commission must vary the determination as requested in the application.
25  Decisions on transfer applications
	(1)	Subject to subsection (2), the Commission must, having conducted a review to decide a transfer application, make a decision varying the determination concerned in a way that gives effect to the variation requested in the transfer application.
