     (ii)  To enable the Fund to conduct its operations and transactions, the Fund shall maintain a General Department and a Special Drawing Rights Department. Membership in the Fund shall give the right to participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department.

    (iii)  Operations and transactions authorized by this Agreement shall be conducted through the General Department, consisting in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement of the General Resources Account, the Special Disbursement Account, and the Investment Account; except that operations and transactions involving special drawing rights shall be conducted through the Special Drawing Rights Department.

ARTICLE I

PURPOSES

     The purposes of the International Monetary Fund are:

      (i)  To promote international monetary cooperation through a permanent institution which provides the machinery for consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems.

     (ii)  To facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade, and to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy.

    (iii)  To promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange arrangements among members, and to avoid competitive exchange depreciation.

    (iv)  To assist in the establishment of a multilateral system of payments in respect of current transactions between members and in the elimination of foreign exchange restrictions which hamper the growth of world trade.

     (v)  To give confidence to members by making the general resources of the Fund temporarily available to them under adequate safeguards, thus providing them with opportunity to correct maladjustments in their balance of payments without resorting to measures destructive of national or international prosperity.

    (vi)  In accordance with the above, to shorten the duration and lessen the degree of disequilibrium in the international balances of payments of members.

     The Fund shall be guided in all its policies and decisions by the purposes set forth in this Article.

ARTICLE II

MEMBERSHIP

Section 1\. _Original members_

     The original members of the Fund shall be those of the countries represented at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference whose governments accept membership before December 31, 1945.

Section 2\. _Other member_ s

     Membership shall be open to other countries at such times and in accordance with such terms as may be prescribed by the Board of Governors. These terms, including the terms for subscriptions, shall be based on principles consistent with those applied to other countries that are already members.

ARTICLE III

QUOTAS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS

Section 1\. _Quotas and payment of subscriptions_

     Each member shall be assigned a quota expressed in special drawing rights. The quotas of the members represented at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference which accept membership before December 31, 1945 shall be those set forth in Schedule A. The quotas of other members shall be determined by the Board of Governors. The subscription of each member shall be equal to its quota and shall be paid in full to the Fund at the appropriate depository.

Section 2\. _Adjustment of quotas_

     (_a_)  The Board of Governors shall at intervals of not more than five years conduct a general review, and if it deems it appropriate propose an adjustment, of the quotas of the members. It may also, if it thinks fit, consider at any other time the adjustment of any particular quota at the request of the member concerned.

     (_b_)  The Fund may at any time propose an increase in the quotas of those members of the Fund that were members on August 31, 1975 in proportion to their quotas on that date in a cumulative amount not in excess of amounts transferred under Article V, Section 12 (_f_) (_i_) and (_j_) from the Special Disbursement Account to the General Resources Account.

     (_c_)  An eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for any change in quotas.

     (_d_)  The quota of a member shall not be changed until the member has consented and until payment has been made unless payment is deemed to have been made in accordance with Section 3 (_b_) of this Article.

Section 3\. _Payments when quotas are changed_

     (_a_)  Each member which consents to an increase in its quota under Section 2 (_a_) of this Article shall, within a period determined by the Fund, pay to the Fund twenty‑five percent of the increase in special drawing rights, but the Board of Governors may prescribe that this payment may be made, on the same basis for all members, in whole or in part in the currencies of other members specified, with their concurrence, by the Fund, or in the member’s own currency. A non‑participant shall pay in the currencies of other members specified by the Fund, with their concurrence, a proportion of the increase corresponding to the proportion to be paid in special drawing rights by participants. The balance of the increase shall be paid by the member in its own currency. The Fund’s holdings of a member’s currency shall not be increased above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Article V, Section 8 (_b_) (ii), as a result of payments by other members under this provision.

     (_b_)  Each member which consents to an increase in its quota under Section 2 (_b_) of this Article shall be deemed to have paid to the Fund an amount of subscription equal to such increase.

     (_c_)  If a member consents to a reduction in its quota, the Fund shall, within sixty days, pay to the member an amount equal to the reduction. The payment shall be made in the member’s currency and in such amount of special drawing rights or the currencies of other members specified, with their concurrence, by the Fund as is necessary to prevent the reduction of the Fund’s holdings of the currency below the new quota, provided that in exceptional circumstances the Fund may reduce its holdings of the currency below the new quota by payment to the member in its own currency.

     (_d_)  A seventy percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for any decision under (_a_) above, except for the determination of a period and the specification of currencies under that provision.

Section 4\. _Substitution of securities for currency_

     The Fund shall accept from any member, in place of any part of the member’s currency in the General Resources Account which in the judgment of the Fund is not needed for its operations and transactions, notes or similar obligations issued by the member or the depository designated by the member under Article XIII, Section 2, which shall be non‑negotiable, non‑interest bearing and payable at their face value on demand by crediting the account of the Fund in the designated depository. This Section shall apply not only to currency subscribed by members but also to any currency otherwise due to, or acquired by, the Fund and to be placed in the General Resources Account.

ARTICLE IV

OBLIGATIONS REGARDING EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS

Section 1\. _General obligations of membe_ rs

     Recognizing that the essential purpose of the international monetary system is to provide a framework that facilitates the exchange of goods, services, and capital among countries, and that sustains sound economic growth, and that a principal objective is the continuing development of the orderly underlying conditions that are necessary for financial and economic stability, each member undertakes to collaborate with the Fund and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates. In particular, each member shall:

        (i)   endeavour to direct its economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability, with due regard to its circumstances;

       (ii)   seek to promote stability by fostering orderly underlying economic and financial conditions and a monetary system that does not tend to produce erratic disruptions;

      (iii)   avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members; and

      (iv)   follow exchange policies compatible with the undertakings under this Section.

Section 2\. _General exchange arrangements_

     (_a_)  Each member shall notify the Fund, within thirty days after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, of the exchange arrangements it intends to apply in fulfillment of its obligations under Section 1 of this Article, and shall notify the Fund promptly of any changes in its exchange arrangements.

     (_b_)  Under an international monetary system of the kind prevailing on January 1, 1976, exchange arrangements may include (i) the maintenance by a member of a value for its currency in terms of the special drawing right or another denominator, other than gold, selected by the member, or (ii) cooperative arrangements by which members maintain the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, or (iii) other exchange arrangements of a member’s choice.

     (_c_)  To accord with the development of the international monetary system, the Fund, by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power, may make provision for general exchange arrangements without limiting the right of members to have exchange arrangements of their choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and the obligations under Section 1 of this Article.

Section 3\. _Surveillance over exchange arrangements_

     (_a_)  The Fund shall oversee the international monetary system in order to ensure its effective operation, and shall oversee the compliance of each member with its obligations under Section 1 of this Article.

     (_b_)  In order to fulfill its functions under (_a_) above, the Fund shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members, and shall adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies. Each member shall provide the Fund with the information necessary for such surveillance, and, when requested by the Fund, shall consult with it on the member’s exchange rate policies. The principles adopted by the Fund shall be consistent with cooperative arrangements by which members maintain the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, as well as with other exchange arrangements of a member’s choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and Section 1 of this Article. These principles shall respect the domestic social and political policies of members, and in applying these principles the Fund shall pay due regard to the circumstances of members.

Section 4\. _Par values_

     The Fund may determine, by an eighty‑five per cent majority of the total voting power, that international economic conditions permit the introduction of a widespread system of exchange arrangements based on stable but adjustable par values. The Fund shall make the determination on the basis of the underlying stability of the world economy, and for this purpose shall take into account price movements and rates of expansion in the economies of members. The determination shall be made in light of the evolution of the international monetary system, with particular reference to sources of liquidity, and, in order to ensure the effective operation of a system of par values, to arrangements under which both members in surplus and members in deficit in their balances of payments take prompt, effective, and symmetrical action to achieve adjustment, as well as to arrangements for intervention and the treatment of imbalances. Upon making such determination, the Fund shall notify members that the provisions of Schedule C apply.

Section 5\. _Separate currencies within a member’s territories_

     (_a_)  Action by a member with respect to its currency under this Article shall be deemed to apply to the separate currencies of all territories in respect of which the member has accepted this Agreement under Article XXXI, Section 2 (_g_) unless the member declares that its action relates either to the metropolitan currency alone, or only to one or more specified separate currencies, or to the metropolitan currency and one or more specified separate currencies.

     (_b_)  Action by the Fund under this Article shall be deemed to relate to all currencies of a member referred to in (_a_) above unless the Fund declares otherwise.

ARTICLE V

OPERATIONS AND TRANSACTIONS OF THE FUND

Section 1\. _Agencies dealing with the Fund_

     Each member shall deal with the Fund only through its Treasury, central bank, stabilization fund, or other similar fiscal agency, and the Fund shall deal only with or through the same agencies.

Section 2\. _Limitation on the Fund’s operations and transactions_

     (_a_)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, transactions on the account of the Fund shall be limited to transactions for the purpose of supplying a member, on the initiative of such member, with special drawing rights or the currencies of other members from the general resources of the Fund, which shall be held in the General Resources Account, in exchange for the currency of the member desiring to make the purchase.

     (_b_)  If requested, the Fund may decide to perform financial and technical services, including the administration of resources contributed by members, that are consistent with the purposes of the Fund. Operations involved in the performance of such financial services shall not be on the account of the Fund. Services under this subsection shall not impose any obligation on a member without its consent.

Section 3\. _Conditions governing use of the Fund’s general resources_

     (_a_)  The Fund shall adopt policies on the use of its general resources, including policies on stand‑by or similar arrangements, and may adopt special policies for special balance of payments problems, that will assist members to solve their balance of payments problems in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that will establish adequate safeguards for the temporary use of the general resources of the Fund.

     (_b_)  A member shall be entitled to purchase the currencies of other members from the Fund in exchange for an equivalent amount of its own currency subject to the following conditions:

        (i)   the member’s use of the general resources of the Fund would be in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the policies adopted under them;

       (ii)   the member represents that it has a need to make the purchase because of its balance of payments or its reserve position or developments in its reserves;

      (iii)   the proposed purchase would be a reserve tranche purchase, or would not cause the Fund’s holdings of the purchasing member’s currency to exceed two hundred percent of its quota;

      (iv)   the Fund has not previously declared under Section 5 of this Article, Article VI, Section 1, or Article XXVI, Section 2 (_a_) that the member desiring to purchase is ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund.

     (_c_)  The Fund shall examine a request for a purchase to determine whether the proposed purchase would be consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and the policies adopted under them, provided that requests for reserve tranche purchases shall not be subject to challenge.

     (_d_)  The Fund shall adopt policies and procedures on the selection of currencies to be sold that take into account, in consultation with members, the balance of payments and reserve position of members and developments in the exchange markets, as well as the desirability of promoting over time balanced positions in the Fund, provided that if a member represents that it is proposing to purchase the currency of another member because the purchasing member wishes to obtain an equivalent amount of its own currency offered by the other member, it shall be entitled to purchase the currency of the other member unless the Fund has given notice under Article VII, Section 3 that its holdings of the currency have become scarce.

     (_e_) (i)  Each member shall ensure that balances of its currency purchased from the Fund are balances of a freely usable currency or can be exchanged at the time of purchase for a freely usable currency of its choice at an exchange rate between the two currencies equivalent to the exchange rate between them on the basis of Article XIX, Section 7 (_a_).

          (ii)  Each member whose currency is purchased from the Fund or is obtained in exchange for currency purchased from the Fund shall collaborate with the Fund and other members to enable such balances of its currency to be exchanged, at the time of purchase, for the freely usable currencies of other members.

         (iii)  An exchange under (i) above of a currency that is not freely usable shall be made by the member whose currency is purchased unless that member and the purchasing member agree on another procedure.

         (iv)  A member purchasing from the Fund the freely usable currency of another member and wishing to exchange it at the time of purchase for another freely usable currency shall make the exchange with the other member if requested by that member. The exchange shall be made for a freely usable currency selected by the other member at the rate of exchange referred to in (i) above.

      (_f_)  Under policies and procedures which it shall adopt, the Fund may agree to provide a participant making a purchase in accordance with this Section with special drawing rights instead of the currencies of other members.

Section 4\. _Waiver of conditions_

     The Fund may in its discretion, and on terms which safeguard its interests, waive any of the conditions prescribed in Section 3 (_b_) (iii) and (iv) of this Article, especially in the case of members with a record of avoiding large or continuous use of the Fund’s general resources. In making a waiver it shall take into consideration periodic or exceptional requirements of the member requesting the waiver. The Fund shall also take into consideration a member’s willingness to pledge as collateral security acceptable assets having a value sufficient in the opinion of the Fund to protect its interests and may require as a condition of waiver the pledge of such collateral security.

Section 5\. _Ineligibility to use the Fund’s general resources_

     Whenever the Fund is of the opinion that any member is using the general resources of the Fund in a manner contrary to the purposes of the Fund, it shall present to the member a report setting forth the views of the Fund and prescribing a suitable time for reply. After presenting such a report to a member, the Fund may limit the use of its general resources by the member. If no reply to the report is received from the member within the prescribed time, or if the reply received is unsatisfactory, the Fund may continue to limit the member’s use of the general resources of the Fund or may, after giving reasonable notice to the member, declare it ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund.

Section 6\. _Other purchases and sales of special drawing rights by the Fund_

     (_a_)  The Fund may accept special drawing rights offered by a participant in exchange for an equivalent amount of the currencies of other members.

     (_b_)  The Fund may provide a participant, at its request, with special drawing rights for an equivalent amount of the currencies of other members. The Fund’s holdings of a member’s currency shall not be increased as a result of these transactions above the level at which the holdings would be subject to charges under Section 8 (_b_) (ii) of this Article.

     (_c_)  The currencies provided or accepted by the Fund under this Section shall be selected in accordance with policies that take into account the principles of Section 3 (_d_) or 7 (_i_) of this Article. The Fund may enter into transactions under this Section only if a member whose currency is provided or accepted by the Fund concurs in that use of its currency.

Section 7\. _Repurchase by a member of its currency held by the Fund_

     (_a_)  A member shall be entitled to repurchase at any time the Fund’s holdings of its currency that are subject to charges under Section 8 (_b_) of this Article.

     (_b_)  A member that has made a purchase under Section 3 of this Article will be expected normally, as its balance of payments and reserve position improves, to repurchase the Fund’s holdings of its currency that result from the purchase and are subject to charges under Section 8 (_b_) of this Article. A member shall repurchase these holdings if, in accordance with policies on repurchase that the Fund shall adopt and after consultation with the member, the Fund represents to the member that it should repurchase because of an improvement in its balance of payments and reserve position.

     (_c_)  A member that has made a purchase under Section 3 of this Article shall repurchase the Fund’s holdings of its currency that result from the purchase and are subject to charges under Section 8 (_b_) of this Article not later than 5 years after the date on which the purchase was made. The Fund may prescribe that repurchase shall be made by a member in installments during the period beginning three years and ending five years after the date of a purchase. The Fund, by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power, may change the periods for repurchase under this subsection, and any period so adopted shall apply to all members.

     (_d_)  The Fund, by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power, may adopt periods other than those that apply in accordance with (_c_) above, which shall be the same for all members, for the repurchase of holdings of currency acquired by the Fund pursuant to a special policy on the use of its general resources.

     (_e_)  A member shall repurchase, in accordance with policies that the Fund shall adopt by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, the Fund’s holdings of its currency that are not acquired as a result of purchases and are subject to charges under Section 8 (_b_) (ii) of this Article.

      (_f_)  A decision prescribing that under a policy on the use of the general resources of the Fund the period for repurchase under (_c_) or (_d_) above shall be shorter than the one in effect under the policy shall apply only to holdings acquired by the Fund subsequent to the effective date of the decision.

     (_g_)  The Fund, on the request of a member, may postpone the date of discharge of a repurchase obligation, but not beyond the maximum period under (_c_) or (_d_) above or under policies adopted by the Fund under (_e_) above, unless the Fund determines, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, that a longer period for repurchase which is consistent with the temporary use of the general resources of the Fund is justified because discharge on the due date would result in exceptional hardship for the member.

     (_h_)  The Fund’s policies under Section 3 (_d_) of this Article may be supplemented by policies under which the Fund may decide after consultation with a member to sell under Section 3 (_b_) of this article its holdings of the member’s currency that have not been repurchased in accordance with this Section 7, without prejudice to any action that the Fund may be authorized to take under any other provision of this Agreement.

      (_i_)  All repurchases under this Section shall be made with special drawing rights or with the currencies of other members specified by the Fund. The Fund shall adopt policies and procedures with regard to the currencies to be used by members in making repurchases that take into account the principles in Section 3 (_d_) of this Article. The Fund’s holdings of a member’s currency that is used in repurchase shall not be increased by the repurchase above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Section 8 (_b_) (ii) of this Article.

      (_j_) (i)  If a member’s currency specified by the Fund under (_i_) above is not a freely usable currency, the member shall ensure that the repurchasing member can obtain it at the time of the repurchase in exchange for a freely usable currency selected by the member whose currency has been specified. An exchange of currency under this provision shall take place at an exchange rate between the two currencies equivalent to the exchange rate between them on the basis of Article XIX, Section 7 (_a_).

          (ii)  Each member whose currency is specified by the Fund for repurchase shall collaborate with the Fund and other members to enable repurchasing members, at the time of the repurchase, to obtain the specified currency in exchange for the freely usable currencies of other members.

         (iii)  An exchange under (_j_) (i) above shall be made with the member whose currency is specified unless that member and the repurchasing member agree on another procedure.

         (iv)  If a repurchasing member wishes to obtain, at the time of the repurchase, the freely usable currency of another member specified by the Fund under (_i_) above, it shall, if requested by the other member, obtain the currency from the other member in exchange for a freely usable currency at the rate of exchange referred to in (_j_) (i) above. The Fund may adopt regulations on the freely usable currency to be provided in an exchange.

Section 8\. _Charges_

     (_a_) (i)  The Fund shall levy a service charge on the purchase by a member of special drawing rights or the currency of another member held in the General Resources Account in exchange for its own currency, provided that the Fund may levy a lower service charge on reserve tranche purchases than on other purchases. The service charge on reserve tranche purchases shall not exceed one‑half of one percent.

          (ii)  The Fund may levy a charge for stand‑by or similar arrangements. The Fund may decide that the charge for an arrangement shall be offset against the service charge levied under (i) above on purchases under the arrangement.

     (_b_)  The Fund shall levy charges on its average daily balances of a member’s currency held in the General Resources Account to the extent that they

           (i)  have been acquired under a policy that has been the subject of an exclusion under Article XXX (_c_), or

          (ii)  exceed the amount of the member’s quota after excluding any balances referred to in (i) above.

The rates of charge normally shall rise at intervals during the period in which balances are held.

     (_c_)  If a member fails to make a repurchase required under Section 7 of this Article, the Fund, after consultation with the member on the reduction of the Fund’s holdings of its currency, may impose such charges as the Fund deems appropriate on its holdings of the member’s currency that should have been repurchased.

     (_d_)  A seventy percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for the determination of the rates of charge under (_a_) and (_b_) above, which shall be uniform for all members, and under (_c_) above.

     (_e_)  A member shall pay all charges in special drawing rights, provided that in exceptional circumstances the Fund may permit a member to pay charges in the currencies of other members specified by the Fund, after consultation with them, or in its own currency. The Fund’s holdings of a member’s currency shall not be increased as a result of payments by other members under this provision above the level at which they would be subject to charges under (_b_) (ii) above.

Section 9\. _Remuneration_

     (_a_)  The Fund shall pay remuneration on the amount by which the percentage of quota prescribed under (_b_) or (_c_) below exceeds the Fund’s average daily balances of a member’s currency held in the General Resources Account other than balances acquired under a policy that has been the subject of an exclusion under Article XXX (_c_). The rate of remuneration, which shall be determined by the Fund by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, shall be the same for all members and shall be not more than, nor less than four‑fifths of, the rate of interest under Article XX, Section 3\. In establishing the rate of remuneration, the Fund shall take into account the rates of charge under Article V, Section 8 (_b_).

     (_b_)  The percentage of quota applying for the purposes of (_a_) above shall be:

           (i)  for each member that became a member before the second amendment of this Agreement, a percentage of quota corresponding to seventy‑five percent of its quota on the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, and for each member that became a member after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, a percentage of quota calculated by dividing the total of the amounts corresponding to the percentages of quota that apply to the other members on the date on which the member became a member by the total of the quotas of the other members on the same date; plus

          (ii)  the amounts it has paid to the Fund in currency or special drawing rights under Article III, Section 3 (_a_) since the date applicable under (_b_) (i) above; and minus

         (iii)  the amounts it has received from the Fund in currency or special drawing rights under Article III, Section 3 (_c_) since the date applicable under (_b_) (i) above.

     (_c_)  The Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, may raise the latest percentage of quota applying for the purposes of (_a_) above to each member to:

           (i)  a percentage, not in excess of one hundred percent, that shall be determined for each member on the basis of the same criteria for all members, or

          (ii)  one hundred percent for all members.

     (_d_)  Remuneration shall be paid in special drawing rights, provided that either the Fund or the member may decide that the payment to the member shall be made in its own currency.

Section 10\. _Computations_

     (_a_)  The value of the Fund’s assets held in the accounts of the General Department shall be expressed in terms of the special drawing right.

     (_b_)  All computations relating to currencies of members for the purpose of applying the provisions of this Agreement, except Article IV and Schedule C, shall be at the rates at which the Fund accounts for these currencies in accordance with Section 11 of this Article.

     (_c_)  Computations for the determination of amounts of currency in relation to quota for the purpose of applying the provisions of this Agreement shall not include currency held in the Special Disbursement Account or in the Investment Account.

Section 11\. _Maintenance of value_

     (_a_)  The value of the currencies of members held in the General Resources Account shall be maintained in terms of the special drawing right in accordance with exchange rates under Article XIX, Section 7 (_a_).

     (_b_)  An adjustment in the Fund’s holdings of a member’s currency pursuant to this Section shall be made on the occasion of the use of that currency in an operation or transaction between the Fund and another member and at such other times as the Fund may decide or the member may request. Payments to or by the Fund in respect of an adjustment shall be made within a reasonable time, as determined by the Fund, after the date of adjustment, and at any other time requested by the member.

Section 12\. _Other operations and transactions_

     (_a_)  The Fund shall be guided in all its policies and decisions under this Section by the objectives set forth in Article VIII, Section 7 and by the objective of avoiding the management of the price, or the establishment of a fixed price, in the gold market.

     (_b_)  Decisions of the Fund to engage in operations or transactions under (_c_), (_d_) and (_e_) below shall be made by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power.

     (_c_)  The Fund may sell gold for the currency of any member after consulting the member for whose currency the gold is sold, provided that the Fund’s holdings of a member’s currency held in the General Resources Account shall not be increased by the sale above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Section 8 (_b_) (ii) of this Article without the concurrence of the member, and provided that, at the request of the member, the Fund at the time of sale shall exchange for the currency of another member such part of the currency received as would prevent such an increase. The exchange of a currency for the currency of another member shall be made after consultation with that member, and shall not increase the Fund’s holdings of that member’s currency above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Section 8 (_b_) (ii) of this Article. The Fund shall adopt policies and procedures with regard to exchanges that take into account the principles applied under Section 7 (_i_) of this Article. Sales under this provision to a member shall be at a price agreed for each transaction on the basis of prices in the market.

     (_d_)  The Fund may accept payments from a member in gold instead of special drawing rights or currency in any operations or transactions under this Agreement. Payments to the Fund under this provision shall be at a price agreed for each operation or transaction on the basis of prices in the market.

     (_e_)  The Fund may sell gold held by it on the date of the second amendment of this Agreement to those members that were members on August 31, 1975 and that agree to buy it, in proportion to their quotas on that date. If the Fund intends to sell gold under (_c_) above for the purpose of (_f_) (ii) below, it may sell to each developing member that agrees to buy it that portion of the gold which, if sold under (_c_) above, would have produced the excess that could have been distributed to it under (_f_) (iii) below. The gold that would be sold under this provision to a member that has been declared ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund under Section 5 of this Article shall be sold to it when the ineligibility ceases, unless the Fund decides to make the sale sooner. The sale of gold to a member under this subsection (_e_) shall be made in exchange for its currency and at a price equivalent at the time of sale to one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold.

      (_f_)  Whenever under (_c_) above the Fund sells gold held by it on the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, an amount of the proceeds equivalent at the time of sale to one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold shall be placed in the General Resources Account and, except as the Fund may decide otherwise under (_g_) below, any excess shall be held in the Special Disbursement Account. The assets held in the Special Disbursement Account shall be held separately from the other accounts of the General Department, and may be used at any time:

           (i)  to make transfers to the General Resources Account for immediate use in operations and transactions authorized by provisions of this Agreement other than this Section;

          (ii)  for operations and transactions that are not authorized by other provisions of this Agreement but are consistent with the purposes of the Fund. Under this subsection (_f_) (ii) balance of payments assistance may be made available on special terms to developing members in difficult circumstances, and for this purpose the Fund shall take into account the level of per capita income;

         (iii)  for distribution to those developing members that were members on August 31, 1975, in proportion to their quotas on that date, of such part of the assets that the Fund decides to use for the purposes of (ii) above as corresponds to the proportion of the quotas of these members on the date of distribution to the total of the quotas of all members on the same date, provided that the distribution under this provision to a member that has been declared ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund under Section 5 of this Article shall be made when the ineligibility ceases, unless the Fund decides to make the distribution sooner.

Decisions to use assets pursuant to (i) above shall be taken by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, and decisions pursuant to (ii) and (iii) above shall be taken by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power.

     (_g_)  The Fund may decide, by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power, to transfer a part of the excess referred to in (_f_) above to the Investment Account for use pursuant to the provisions of Article XII, Section 6 (_f_).

     (_h_)  Pending uses specified under (_f_) above, the Fund may invest a member’s currency held in the Special Disbursement Account in marketable obligations of that member or in marketable obligations of international financial organizations. The income of investment and interest received under (_f_) (ii) above shall be placed in the Special Disbursement Account. No investment shall be made without the concurrence of the member whose currency is used to make the investment. The Fund shall invest only in obligations denominated in special drawing rights or in the currency used for investment.

      (_i_)  The General Resources Account shall be reimbursed from time to time in respect of the expenses of administration of the Special Disbursement Account paid from the General Resources Account by transfers from the Special Disbursement Account on the basis of a reasonable estimate of such expenses.

      (_j_)  The Special Disbursement Account shall be terminated in the event of the liquidation of the Fund and may be terminated prior to liquidation of the Fund by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power. Upon termination of the account because of the liquidation of the Fund, any assets in this account shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Schedule K. Upon termination prior to liquidation of the Fund, any assets in this account shall be transferred to the General Resources Account for immediate use in operations and transactions. The Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, shall adopt rules and regulations for the administration of the Special Disbursement Account.

ARTICLE VI

CAPITAL TRANSFERS

Section 1\. _Use of the Fund’s general resources for capital transfers_

     (_a_)  A member may not use the Fund’s general resources to meet a large or sustained outflow of capital except as provided in Section 2 of this Article, and the Fund may request a member to exercise controls to prevent such use of the general resources of the Fund. If, after receiving such a request, a member fails to exercise appropriate controls, the Fund may declare the member ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund.

     (_b_)  Nothing in this Section shall be deemed:

           (i)  to prevent the use of the general resources of the Fund for capital transactions of reasonable amount required for the expansion of exports or in the ordinary course of trade, banking, or other business; or

          (ii)  to affect capital movements which are met out of a member’s own resources, but members undertake that such capital movements will be in accordance with the purposes of the Fund.

Section 2\. _Special provisions for capital transfers_

     A member shall be entitled to make reserve tranche purchases to meet capital transfers.

Section 3\. _Controls of capital transfers_

     Members may exercise such controls as are necessary to regulate international capital movements, but no member may exercise these controls in a manner which will restrict payments for current transactions or which will unduly delay transfers of funds in settlement of commitments, except as provided in Article VII, Section 3 (_b_) and in Article XIV, Section 2.

ARTICLE VII

REPLENISHMENT AND SCARCE CURRENCIES

Section 1\. _Measures to replenish the Fund’s holdings of currencies_

     The Fund may, if it deems such action appropriate to replenish its holdings of any member’s currency in the General Resources Account needed in connection with its transactions, take either or both of the following steps:

      (i)  propose to the member that, on terms and conditions agreed between the Fund and the member, the latter lend its currency to the Fund or that, with the concurrence of the member, the Fund borrow such currency from some other source either within or outside the territories of the member, but no member shall be under any obligation to make such loans to the Fund or to concur in the borrowing of its currency by the Fund from any other source;

     (ii)  require the member, if it is a participant, to sell its currency to the Fund for special drawing rights held in the General Resources Account, subject to Article XIX, Section 4\. In replenishing with special drawing rights, the Fund shall pay due regard to the principles of designation under Article XIX, Section 5.

Section 2\. _General scarcity of currency_

     If the Fund finds that a general scarcity of a particular currency is developing, the Fund may so inform members and may issue a report setting forth the causes of the scarcity and containing recommendations designed to bring it to an end. A representative of the member whose currency is involved shall participate in the preparation of the report.

Section 3\. _Scarcity of the Fund’s holdings_

     (_a_)  If it becomes evident to the Fund that the demand for a member’s currency seriously threatens the Fund’s ability to supply that currency, the Fund, whether or not it has issued a report under Section 2 of this Article, shall formally declare such currency scarce and shall thenceforth apportion its existing and accruing supply of the scarce currency with due regard to the relative needs of members, the general international economic situation, and any other pertinent considerations. The Fund shall also issue a report concerning its action.

     (_b_)  A formal declaration under (_a_) above shall operate as an authorization to any member, after consultation with the Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on the freedom of exchange operations in the scarce currency. Subject to the provisions of Article IV and Schedule C, the member shall have complete jurisdiction in determining the nature of such limitations, but they shall be no more restrictive than is necessary to limit the demand for the scarce currency to the supply held by, or accruing to, the member in question, and they shall be relaxed and removed as rapidly as conditions permit.

     (_c_)  The authorization under (_b_) above shall expire whenever the Fund formally declares the currency in question to be no longer scarce.

Section 4\. _Administration of restrictions_

     Any member imposing restrictions in respect of the currency of any other member pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 (_b_) of this Article shall give sympathetic consideration to any representations by the other member regarding the administration of such restrictions.

Section 5\. _Effect of other international agreements on restrictions_

     Members agree not to invoke the obligations of any engagements entered into with other members prior to this Agreement in such a manner as will prevent the operation of the provisions of this Article.

Members undertake, however, to furnish the desired information in as detailed and accurate a manner as is practicable and, so far as possible, to avoid mere estimates.

ALLOCATION AND CANCELLATION OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS

     (_a_)  In all its decisions with respect to the allocation and cancellation of special drawing rights the Fund shall seek to meet the long‑term global need, as and when it arises, to supplement existing reserve assets in such manner as will promote the attainment of its purposes and will avoid economic stagnation and deflation as well as excess demand and inflation in the world.

     (_b_)  The first decision to allocate special drawing rights shall take into account, as special considerations, a collective judgment that there is a global need to supplement reserves, and the attainment of a better balance of payments equilibrium, as well as the likelihood of a better working of the adjustment process in the future.

Section 2\. _Allocation and cancellation_

     (_a_)  Decisions of the Fund to allocate or cancel special drawing rights shall be made for basic periods which shall run consecutively and shall be five years in duration. The first basic period shall begin on the date of the first decision to allocate special drawing rights or such later date as may be specified in that decision. Any allocations or cancellations shall take place at yearly intervals.

     (_b_)  The rates at which allocations are to be made shall be expressed as percentages of quotas on the date of each decision to allocate. The rates at which special drawing rights are to be cancelled shall be expressed as percentages of net cumulative allocations of special drawing rights on the date of each decision to cancel. The percentages shall be the same for all participants.

     (_c_)  In its decision for any basic period the Fund may provide, notwithstanding (_a_) and (_b_) above, that:

           (i)  the duration of the basic period shall be other than five years; or

          (ii)  the allocations or cancellations shall take place at other than yearly intervals; or

         (iii)  the basis for allocations or cancellations shall be the quotas or net cumulative allocations on dates other than the dates of decisions to allocate or cancel.

     (_d_)  A member that becomes a participant after a basic period starts shall receive allocations beginning with the next basic period in which allocations are made after it becomes a participant unless the Fund decides that the new participant shall start to receive allocations beginning with the next allocation after it becomes a participant. If the Fund decides that a member that becomes a participant during a basic period shall receive allocations during the remainder of that basic period and the participant was not a member on the dates established under (_b_) or (_c_) above, the Fund shall determine the basis on which these allocations to the participant shall be made.

     (_e_)  A participant shall receive allocations of special drawing rights made pursuant to any decision to allocate unless:

           (i)  the Governor for the participant did not vote in favor of the decision; and

          (ii)  the participant has notified the Fund in writing prior to the first allocation of special drawing rights under that decision that it does not wish special drawing rights to be allocated to it under the decision. On the request of a participant, the Fund may decide to terminate the effect of the notice with respect to allocations of special drawing rights subsequent to the termination.

      (_f_)  If on the effective date of any cancellation the amount of special drawing rights held by a participant is less than its share of the special drawing rights that are to be cancelled, the participant shall eliminate its negative balance as promptly as its gross reserve position permits and shall remain in consultation with the Fund for this purpose. Special drawing rights acquired by the participant after the effective date of the cancellation shall be applied against its negative balance and cancelled.

Section 3\. _Unexpected major developments_

     The Fund may change the rates or intervals of allocation or cancellation during the rest of a basic period or change the length of a basic period or start a new basic period, if at any time the Fund finds it desirable to do so because of unexpected major developments.

Section 4\. _Decisions on allocations and cancellations_

     (_a_)  Decisions under Section 2 (_a_), (_b_), and (_c_) or Section 3 of this Article shall be made by the Board of Governors on the basis of proposals of the Managing Director concurred in by the Executive Board.

In addition, before making a proposal for the first allocation, the Managing Director shall satisfy himself that the provisions of Section 1 (_b_) of this Article have been met and that there is broad support among participants to begin allocations; he shall make a proposal for the first allocation as soon after the establishment of the Special Drawing Rights Department as he is so satisfied.

     (_c_)  The Managing Director shall make proposals:

           (i)  not later than six months before the end of each basic period;

          (ii)  if no decision has been taken with respect to allocation or cancellation for a basic period, whenever he is satisfied that the provisions of (_b_) above have been met;

         (iii)  when, in accordance with Section 3 of this Article, he considers that it would be desirable to change the rate or intervals of allocation or cancellation or change the length of a basic period or start a new basic period; or

         (iv)  within six months of a request by the Board of Governors or the Executive Board;

provided that, if under (i), (iii), or (iv) above the Managing Director ascertains that there is no proposal which he considers to be consistent with the provisions of Section 1 of this Article that has broad support among participants in accordance with (_b_) above, he shall report to the Board of Governors and to the Executive Board.

     (_d_)  An eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for decisions under Section 2 (_a_), (_b_), and (_c_) or Section 3 of this Article except for decisions under Section 3 with respect to a decrease in the rates of allocation.

     (_d_)  The Fund may make representations to a participant that enters into any operation or transaction under (_b_) or (_c_) above that in the judgment of the Fund may be prejudicial to the process of designation according to the principles of Section 5 of this Article or is otherwise inconsistent with Article XXII. A participant that persists in entering into such operations or transactions shall be subject to Article XXIII, Section 2 (_b_).

Section 3\. _Requirement of need_

     (_a_)  In transactions under Section 2 (_a_) of this Article, except as otherwise provided in (_c_) below, a participant will be expected to use its special drawing rights only if it has a need because of its balance of payments or its reserve position or developments in its reserves, and not for the sole purpose of changing the composition of its reserves.

     (_b_)  The use of special drawing rights shall not be subject to challenge on the basis of the expectation in (_a_) above, but the Fund may make representations to a participant that fails to fulfill this expectation. A participant that persists in failing to fulfill this expectation shall be subject to Article XXIII, Section 2 (_b_).

     (_c_)  The Fund may waive the expectation in (_a_) above in any transactions in which a participant uses special drawing rights to obtain an equivalent amount of currency from a participant designated under Section 5 of this Article that would promote reconstitution by the other participant under Section 6 (_a_) of this Article; prevent or reduce a negative balance of the other participant; or offset the effect of a failure by the other participant to fulfill the expectation in (_a_) above.

Section 4\. _Obligation to provide currency_

     (_a_)  A participant designated by the Fund under Section 5 of this Article shall provide on demand a freely usable currency to a participant using special drawing rights under Section 2 (_a_) of this Article. A participant’s obligation to provide currency shall not extend beyond the point at which its holdings of special drawing rights in excess of its net cumulative allocation are equal to twice its net cumulative allocation or such higher limit as may be agreed between a participant and the Fund.

     (_b_)  A participant may provide currency in excess of the obligatory limit or any agreed higher limit.

Section 5\. _Designation of participants to provide currency_

     (_a_)  The Fund shall ensure that a participant will be able to use its special drawing rights by designating participants to provide currency for specified amounts of special drawing rights for the purposes of Sections 2 (_a_) and 4 of this Article. Designations shall be made in accordance with the following general principles supplemented by such other principles as the Fund may adopt from time to time:

           (i)  A participant shall be subject to designation if its balance of payments and gross reserve position is sufficiently strong, but this will not preclude the possibility that a participant with a strong reserve position will be designated even though it has a moderate balance of payments deficit. Participants shall be designated in such manner as will promote over time a balanced distribution of holdings of special drawing rights among them.

          (ii)  Participants shall be subject to designation in order to promote reconstitution under Section 6 (_a_) of this Article, to reduce negative balances in holdings of special drawing rights, or to offset the effect of failures to fulfill the expectation in Section 3 (_a_) of this Article.

         (iii)  In designating participants the Fund normally shall give priority to those that need to acquire special drawing rights to meet the objectives of designation under (ii) above.

     (_b_)  In order to promote over time a balanced distribution of holdings of special drawing rights under (_a_) (i) above, the Fund shall apply the rules for designation in Schedule F or such rules as may be adopted under (_c_) below.

     (_c_)  The rules for designation may be reviewed at any time and new rules shall be adopted if necessary. Unless new rules are adopted, the rules in force at the time of the review shall continue to apply.

Section 6\. _Reconstitution_

     (_a_)  Participants that use their special drawing rights shall reconstitute their holdings of them in accordance with the rules for reconstitution in Schedule G or such rules as may be adopted under (_b_) below.

     (_b_)  The rules for reconstitution may be reviewed at any time and new rules shall be adopted if necessary. Unless new rules are adopted or a decision is made to abrogate rules for reconstitution, the rules in force at the time of review shall continue to apply. A seventy percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for decisions to adopt, modify, or abrogate the rules for reconstitution.

Section 7\. _Exchange rates_

     (_a_)  Except as otherwise provided in (_b_) below, the exchange rates for transactions between participants under Section 2 (_a_) and (_b_) of this Article shall be such that participants using special drawing rights shall receive the same value whatever currencies might be provided and whichever participants provide those currencies, and the Fund shall adopt regulations to give effect to this principle.

     (_b_)  The Fund, by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power, may adopt policies under which in exceptional circumstances the Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, may authorize participants entering into transactions under Section 2 (_b_) of this Article to agree on exchange rates other than those applicable under (_a_) above.

     (_c_)  The Fund shall consult a participant on the procedure for determining rates of exchange for its currency.

     (_d_)  For the purpose of this provision the term participant includes a terminating participant.

SCHEDULE B

TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO REPURCHASE, PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS, GOLD, AND CERTAIN OPERATIONAL MATTERS

       1.  Repurchase obligations that have accrued pursuant to Article V, Section 7 (_b_) before the date of the second amendment of this Agreement and that remain undischarged at that date shall be discharged not later than the date or dates at which the obligations had to be discharged in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement before the second amendment.

       2.  A member shall discharge with special drawing rights any obligation to pay gold to the Fund in repurchase or as a subscription that is outstanding at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, but the Fund may prescribe that these payments may be made in whole or in part in the currencies of other members specified by the Fund. A non‑participant shall discharge an obligation that must be paid in special drawing rights pursuant to this provision with the currencies of other members specified by the Fund.

       3.  For the purposes of 2 above 0.888 671 gram of fine gold shall be equivalent to one special drawing right, and the amount of currency payable under 2 above shall be determined on that basis and on the basis of the value of the currency in terms of the special drawing right at the date of discharge.

       4.  A member’s currency held by the Fund in excess of seventy‑five percent of the member’s quota at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement and not subject to repurchase under 1 above shall be repurchased in accordance with the following rules:

           (i)  Holdings that resulted from a purchase shall be repurchased in accordance with the policy on the use of the Fund’s general resources under which the purchase was made.

          (ii)  Other holdings shall be repurchased not later than four years after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement.

       5.  Repurchases under 1 above that are not subject to 2 above, repurchases under 4 above, and any specification of currencies under 2 above shall be in accordance with Article V, Section 7 (_i_).

       6.  All rules and regulations, rates, procedures, and decisions in effect at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement shall remain in effect until they are changed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

       7.  To the extent that arrangements equivalent in effect to (_a_) and (_b_) below have not been completed before the date of the second amendment of this Agreement, the Fund shall

     (_a_)  sell up to 25 million ounces of fine gold held by it on August 31, 1975 to those members that were members on that date and that agree to buy it, in proportion to their quotas on that date. The sale to a member under this subparagraph (_a_) shall be made in exchange for its currency and at a price equivalent at the time of sale to one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold, and

     (_b_)  sell up to 25 million ounces of fine gold held by it on August 31, 1975 for the benefit of developing members that were members on that date, provided, however, that the part of any profits or surplus value of the gold that corresponds to the proportion of such a member’s quota on August 31, 1975 to the total of the quotas of all members on that date shall be transferred directly to each such member. The requirements under Article V, Section 12 (_c_) that the Fund consult a member, obtain a member’s concurrence, or exchange a member’s currency for the currencies of other members in certain circumstances shall apply with respect to currency received by the Fund as a result of sales of gold under this provision, other than sales to a member in return for its own currency, and placed in the General Resources Account.

Upon the sale of gold under this paragraph 7, an amount of the proceeds in the currencies received equivalent at the time of sale to one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold shall be placed in the General Resources Account and other assets held by the Fund under arrangements pursuant to (_b_) above shall be held separately from the general resources of the Fund. Assets that remain subject to disposition by the Fund upon termination of arrangements pursuant to (_b_) above shall be transferred to the Special Disbursement Account.

SCHEDULE C

PAR VALUES

       1.  The Fund shall notify members that par values may be established for the purposes of this Agreement, in accordance with Article IV, Sections 1, 3, 4, and 5 and this Schedule, in terms of the special drawing right, or in terms of such other common denominator as is prescribed by the Fund. The common denominator shall not be gold or a currency.

       2.  A member that intends to establish a par value for its currency shall propose a par value to the Fund within a reasonable time after notice is given under 1 above.

       3.  Any member that does not intend to establish a par value for its currency under 1 above shall consult with the Fund and ensure that its exchange arrangements are consistent with the purposes of the Fund and are adequate to fulfill its obligations under Article IV, Section 1.

       4.  The Fund shall concur in or object to a proposed par value within a reasonable period after receipt of the proposal. A proposed par value shall not take effect for the purposes of this Agreement if the Fund objects to it, and the member shall be subject to 3 above. The Fund shall not object because of the domestic social or political policies of the member proposing the par value.

       5.  Each member that has a par value for its currency undertakes to apply appropriate measures consistent with this Agreement in order to ensure that the maximum and the minimum rates for spot exchange transactions taking place within its territories between its currency and the currencies of other members maintaining par values shall not differ from parity by more than four and one‑half percent or by such other margin or margins as the Fund may adopt by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power.

       6.  A member shall not propose a change in the par value of its currency except to correct, or prevent the emergence of, a fundamental disequilibrium. A change may be made only on the proposal of the member and only after consultation with the Fund.

       7.  When a change is proposed, the Fund shall concur in or object to the proposed par value within a reasonable period after receipt of the proposal. The Fund shall concur if it is satisfied that the change is necessary to correct, or prevent the emergence of, a fundamental disequilibrium. The Fund shall not object because of the domestic social or political policies of the member proposing the change. A proposed change in par value shall not take effect for the purposes of this Agreement if the Fund objects to it. If a member changes the par value of its currency despite the objection of the Fund, the member shall be subject to Article XXVI, Section 2\. Maintenance of an unrealistic par value by a member shall be discouraged by the Fund.

       8.  The par value of a member’s currency established under this Agreement shall cease to exist for the purposes of this Agreement if the member informs the Fund that it intends to terminate the par value. The Fund may object to the termination of a par value by a decision taken by an eighty‑five percent majority of the total voting power. If a member terminates a par value for its currency despite the objection of the Fund, the member shall be subject to Article XXVI, Section 2\. A par value established under this Agreement shall cease to exist for the purposes of this Agreement if the member terminates the par value despite the objection of the Fund, or if the Fund finds that the member does not maintain rates for a substantial volume of exchange transactions in accordance with 5 above, provided that the Fund may not make such finding unless it has consulted the member and given it sixty days notice of the Fund’s intention to consider whether to make a finding.

       9.  If the par value of the currency of a member has ceased to exist under 8 above, the member shall consult with the Fund and ensure that its exchange arrangements are consistent with the purposes of the Fund and are adequate to fulfill its obligations under Article IV, Section 1.

     10.  A member for whose currency the par value has ceased to exist under 8 above may, at any time, propose a new par value for its currency.

     11.  Notwithstanding 6 above, the Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, may make uniform proportionate changes in all par values if the special drawing right is the common denominator and the changes will not affect the value of the special drawing right. The par value of a member’s currency shall, however, not be changed under this provision if, within seven days after the Fund’s action, the member informs the Fund that it does not wish the par value of its currency to be changed by such action.

SCHEDULE D

            (_b_)   The Council shall consider proposals pursuant to Article XXVIII (_a_) to amend the Articles of Agreement.

       3.  (_a_)   The Board of Governors may delegate to the Council authority to exercise any powers of the Board of Governors except the powers conferred directly by this Agreement on the Board of Governors.

            (_b_)   Each Councillor shall be entitled to cast the number of votes allotted under Article XII, Section 5 to the member or group of members appointing him. A Councillor appointed by a group of members may cast separately the votes allotted to each member in the group. If the number of votes allotted to a member cannot be cast by an Executive Director, the member may make arrangements with a Councillor for casting the number of votes allotted to the member.

            (_c_)   The Council shall not take any action pursuant to powers delegated by the Board of Governors that is inconsistent with any action taken by the Board of Governors and the Executive Board shall not take any action pursuant to powers delegated by the Board of Governors that is inconsistent with any action taken either by the Board of Governors or the Council.

       4.  The Council shall select a Councillor as chairman, shall adopt regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to perform its functions, and shall determine any aspect of its procedure.

       5.  (_a_)   The Council shall have powers corresponding to those of the Executive Board under the following provisions: Article XII, Section 2 (_c_), (_f_), (_g_), and (_j_); Article XVIII, Section 4 (_a_) and Section 4 (_c_) (iv); Article XXIII, Section 1; and Article XXVII, Section 1 (_a_).

            (_b_)   for decisions by the Council on matters pertaining exclusively to the Special Drawing Rights Department only Councillors appointed by a member that is a participant or a group of members at least one member of which is a participant shall be entitled to vote. Each of these Councillors shall be entitled to cast the number of votes allotted to the member which is a participant that appointed him or to the members that are participants in the group of members that appointed him, and may cast the votes allotted to a participant with which arrangements have been made pursuant to the last sentence of 3 (_b_) above.

            (_c_)   The Council may by regulation establish a procedure whereby the Executive Board may obtain a vote of the Councillors on a specific question without a meeting of the Council when in the judgment of the Executive Board an action must be taken by the Council which should not be postponed until the next meeting of the Council and which does not warrant the calling of a special meeting.

            (_d_)   Article IX, Section 8 shall apply to Councillors, their Alternates, and Associates, and to any other person entitled to attend a meeting of the Council.

            (_e_)   For the purposes of (_b_) and 3 (_b_) above, an agreement under Article XII, Section 3 (_i_) (ii) by a member, or by a member that is a participant, shall entitle a Councillor to vote and cast the number of votes allotted to the member.

            (_f_)    When an Executive Director is entitled to cast the number of votes allotted to a member pursuant to Article XII, Section 3(_i_)(v), the Councillor appointed by the group whose members elected such Executive Director shall be entitled to vote and cast the number of votes allotted to such member. The member shall be deemed to have participated in the appointment of the Councillor entitled to vote and cast the number of votes allotted to the member.

       6.  The first sentence of Article XII, Section 2 (_a_) shall be deemed to include a reference to the Council.

SCHEDULE E

ELECTION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

       1.  The election of the elective Executive Directors shall be by ballot of the Governors eligible to vote.

       2.  In balloting for the Executive Directors to be elected, each of the Governors eligible to vote shall cast for one person all of the votes to which he is entitled under Article XII, Section 5 (_a_). The fifteen persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be Executive Directors, provided that no person who received less than four percent of the total number of votes that can be cast (eligible votes) shall be considered elected.

       3.  When fifteen persons are not elected in the first ballot, a second ballot shall be held in which there shall vote only (_a_) those Governors who voted in the first ballot for a person not elected, and (_b_) those Governors whose votes for a person elected are deemed under 4 below to have raised the votes cast for that person above nine percent of the eligible votes. If in the second ballot there are more candidates than the number of Executive Directors to be elected, the person who received the lowest number of votes in the first ballot shall be ineligible for election.

       4.  In determining whether the votes cast by a Governor are to be deemed to have raised the total of any person above nine percent of the eligible votes the nine percent shall be deemed to include, first, the votes of the Governor casting the largest number of votes for such person, then the votes of the Governor casting the next largest number, and so on until nine percent is reached.

       5.  Any Governor part of whose votes must be counted in order to raise the total of any person above four percent shall be considered as casting all of his votes for such person even if the total votes for such person thereby exceed nine percent.

       6.  If, after the second ballot, fifteen persons have not been elected, further ballots shall be held on the same principles until fifteen persons have been elected, provided that after fourteen persons are elected, the fifteenth may be elected by a simple majority of the remaining votes and shall be deemed to have been elected by all such votes.

SCHEDULE F

DESIGNATION

          During the first basic period the rules for designation shall be as follows:

          (_a_)  Participants subject to designation under Article XIX, Section 5 (_a_) (i) shall be designated for such amounts as will promote over time equality in the ratios of the participants’ holdings of special drawing rights in excess of their net cumulative allocations to their official holdings of gold and foreign exchange.

          (_b_)  The formula to give effect to (_a_) above shall be such that participants subject to designation shall be designated:

                  (i)   in proportion to their official holdings of gold and foreign exchange when the ratios described in (_a_) above are equal; and

                 (ii)   in such manner as gradually to reduce the difference between the ratios described in (_a_) above that are low and the ratios that are high.

SCHEDULE G

RECONSTITUTION

       1.  During the first basic period the rules for reconstitution shall be as follows:

          (_a_)    (i)   A participant shall so use and reconstitute its holdings of special drawing rights that, five years after the first allocation and at the end of each calendar quarter thereafter, the average of its total daily holdings of special drawing rights over the most recent five‑year period will be not less than thirty percent of the average of its daily net cumulative allocation of special drawing rights over the same period.

                 (ii)   Two years after the first allocation and at the end of each calendar month thereafter the Fund shall make calculations for each participant so as to ascertain whether and to what extent the participant would need to acquire special drawing rights between the date of the calculation and the end of any five year period in order to comply with the requirement in (_a_) (i) above. The Fund shall adopt regulations with respect to the bases on which these calculations shall be made and with respect to the timing of the designation of participants under Article XIX, Section 5 (_a_) (ii), in order to assist them to comply with the requirements in (_a_) (i) above.

                (iii)   The Fund shall give special notice to a participant when the calculations under (_a_) (ii) above indicate that it is unlikely that the participant will be able to comply with the requirement in (_a_) (i) above unless it ceases to use special drawing rights for the rest of the period for which the calculation was made under (_a_) (ii) above.

                (iv)   A participant that needs to acquire special drawing rights to fulfill this obligation shall be obligated and entitled to obtain them, for currency acceptable to the Fund, in a transaction with the Fund conducted through the General Resources Account. If sufficient special drawing rights to fulfill this obligation cannot be obtained in this way, the participant shall be obligated and entitled to obtain them with a freely usable currency from a participant which the Fund shall specify.

          (_b_)  Participants shall also pay due regard to the desirability of pursuing over time a balanced relationship between their holdings of special drawing rights and their other reserves.

       2.  If a participant fails to comply with the rules for reconstitution, the Fund shall determine whether or not the circumstances justify suspension under Article XXIII, Section 2 (_b_).

SCHEDULE H

TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION

       1.  If the obligation remaining after the setoff under Article XXIV, Section 2 (_b_) is to the terminating participant and agreement on settlement between the Fund and the terminating participant is not reached within six months of the date of termination, the Fund shall redeem this balance of special drawing rights in equal half‑yearly installments within a maximum of five years of the date of termination. The Fund shall redeem this balance as it may determine, either (_a_) by the payment to the terminating participant of the amounts provided by the remaining participants to the Fund in accordance with Article XXIV, Section 5, or (_b_) by permitting the terminating participant to use its special drawing rights to obtain its own currency or a freely usable currency from a participant specified by the Fund, the General Resources Account, or any other holder.

       2.  If the obligation remaining after the setoff under Article XXIV, Section 2 (_b_) is to the Fund and agreement on settlement is not reached within six months of the date of termination, the terminating participant shall discharge this obligation in equal half‑yearly installments within three years of the date of termination or within such longer period as may be fixed by the Fund. The terminating participant shall discharge this obligation, as the Fund may determine, either (_a_) by the payment to the Fund of a freely usable currency, or (_b_) by obtaining special drawing rights, in accordance with Article XXIV, Section 6, from the General Resources Account or in agreement with a participant specified by the Fund or from any other holder, and the setoff of these special drawing rights against the installment due.

       3.  Installments under either 1 or 2 above shall fall due six months after the date of termination and at intervals of six months thereafter.

       4.  In the event of the Special Drawing Rights Department going into liquidation under Article XXV within six months of the date a participant terminates its participation, the settlement between the Fund and that government shall be made in accordance with Article XXV and Schedule 1.

SCHEDULE I

ADMINISTRATION OF LIQUIDATION OF THE SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS DEPARTMENT

       1.  In the event of liquidation of the Special Drawing Rights Department, participants shall discharge their obligations to the Fund in ten half‑yearly installments, or in such longer period as the Fund may decide is needed, in a freely usable currency and the currencies of participants holding special drawing rights to be redeemed in any installment to the extent of such redemption, as determined by the Fund. The first half‑yearly payment shall be made six months after the decision to liquidate the Special Drawing Rights Department.

       2.  If it is decided to liquidate the Fund within six months of the date of the decision to liquidate the Special Drawing Rights Department, the liquidation of the Special Drawing Rights Department shall not proceed until special drawing rights held in the General Resources Account have been distributed in accordance with the following rule.

After the distributions made under 2 (_a_) and (_b_) of Schedule K, the Fund shall apportion its special drawing rights held in the General Resources Account among all members that are participants in proportion to the amounts due to each participant after the distribution under 2 (_b_). To determine the amount due to each member for the purpose of apportioning the remainder of its holdings of each currency under 2 (_d_) of Schedule K, the Fund shall deduct the distribution of special drawing rights made under this rule.

       3.  With the amounts received under 1 above, the Fund shall redeem special drawing rights held by holders in the following manner and order:

          (_a_)  Special drawing rights held by governments that have terminated their participation more than six months before the date the Board of Governors decides to liquidate the Special Drawing Rights Department shall be redeemed in accordance with the terms of any agreement under Article XXIV or Schedule H.

          (_b_)  Special drawing rights held by holders that are not participants shall be redeemed before those held by participants, and shall be redeemed in proportion to the amount held by each holder.

          (_c_)  The Fund shall determine the proportion of special drawing rights held by each participant in relation to its net cumulative allocation. The Fund shall first redeem special drawing rights from the participants with the highest proportion until this proportion is reduced to that of the second highest proportion; the Fund shall then redeem the special drawing rights held by these participants in accordance with their net cumulative allocations until the proportions are reduced to that of the third highest proportion; and this process shall be continued until the amount available for redemption is exhausted.

       4.  Any amount that a participant will be entitled to receive in redemption under 3 above shall be set off against any amount to be paid under 1 above.

       5.  During liquidation the Fund shall pay interest on the amount of special drawing rights held by holders, and each participant shall pay charges on the net cumulative allocation of special drawing rights to it less the amount of any payments made in accordance with 1 above. The rates of interest and charges and the time of payment shall be determined by the Fund. Payments of interest and charges shall be made in special drawing rights to the extent possible. A participant that does not hold sufficient special drawing rights to meet any charges shall make the payment with a currency specified by the Fund. Special drawing rights received as charges in amounts needed for administrative expenses shall not be used for the payment of interest, but shall be transferred to the Fund and shall be redeemed first and with the currencies used by the Fund to meet its expenses.

       6.  While a participant is in default with respect to any payment required by 1 or 5 above, no amounts shall be paid to it in accordance with 3 or 5 above.

       7.  If after the final payments have been made to participants each participant not in default does not hold special drawing rights in the same proportion to its net cumulative allocation, those participants holding a lower proportion shall purchase from those holding a higher proportion such amounts in accordance with arrangements made by the Fund as will make the proportion of their holdings of special drawing rights the same. Each participant in default shall pay to the Fund its own currency in an amount equal to its default. The Fund shall apportion this currency and any residual claims among participants in proportion to the amount of special drawing rights held by each and these special drawing rights shall be cancelled. The Fund shall then close the books of the Special Drawing Rights Department and all of the Fund’s liabilities arising from the allocations of special drawing rights and the administration of the Special Drawing Rights Department shall cease.

       8.  Each participant whose currency is distributed to other participants under this Schedule guarantees the unrestricted use of such currency at all times for the purchase of goods or for payments of sums due to it or to persons in its territories. Each participant so obligated agrees to compensate other participants for any loss resulting from the difference between the value at which the Fund distributed its currency under this Schedule and the value realized by such participants on disposal of its currency.

SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS WITH MEMBERS WITHDRAWING

       1.  The settlement of accounts with respect to the General Resources Account shall be made according to 1 to 6 of this Schedule. The Fund shall be obligated to pay to a member withdrawing an amount equal to its quota, plus any other amounts due to it from the Fund, less any amounts due to the Fund, including charges accruing after the date of its withdrawal; but no payment shall be made until six months after the date of withdrawal. Payments shall be made in the currency of the withdrawing member, and for this purpose the Fund may transfer to the General Resources Account holdings of the member’s currency in the Special Disbursement Account or in the Investment Account in exchange for an equivalent amount of the currencies of other members in the General Resources Account selected by the Fund with their concurrence.

       2.  If the Fund’s holdings of the currency of the withdrawing member are not sufficient to pay the net amount due from the Fund, the balance shall be paid in a freely usable currency, or in such other manner as may be agreed. If the Fund and the withdrawing member do not reach agreement within six months of the date of withdrawal, the currency in question held by the Fund shall be paid forthwith to the withdrawing member. Any balance due shall be paid in ten half‑yearly installments during the ensuing five years. Each such installment shall be paid, at the option of the Fund, either in the currency of the withdrawing member acquired after its withdrawal or in a freely usable currency.

       3.  If the Fund fails to meet any installment which is due in accordance with the preceding paragraphs, the withdrawing member shall be entitled to require the Fund to pay the installment in any currency held by the Fund with the exception of any currency which has been declared scarce under Article VII, Section 3.

       4.  If the Fund’s holdings of the currency of a withdrawing member exceed the amount due to it, and if agreement on the method of settling accounts is not reached within six months of the date of withdrawal, the former member shall be obligated to redeem such excess currency in a freely usable currency. Redemption shall be made at the rates at which the Fund would sell such currencies at the time of withdrawal from the Fund. The withdrawing member shall complete redemption within five years of the date of withdrawal, or within such longer period as may be fixed by the Fund, but shall not be required to redeem in any half‑yearly period more than one‑tenth of the Fund’s excess holdings of its currency at the date of withdrawal plus further acquisitions of the currency during such half‑yearly period. If the withdrawing member does not fulfill this obligation, the Fund may in an orderly manner liquidate in any market the amount of currency which should have been redeemed.

       5.  Any member desiring to obtain the currency of a member which has withdrawn shall acquire it by purchase from the Fund, to the extent that such member has access to the general resources of the Fund and that such currency is available under 4 above.

       6.  The withdrawing member guarantees the unrestricted use at all times of the currency disposed of under 4 and 5 above for the purchase of goods or for payment of sums due to it or to persons within its territories. It shall compensate the Fund for any loss resulting from the difference between the value of its currency in terms of the special drawing right on the date of withdrawal and the value realized in terms of the special drawing right by the Fund on disposal under 4 and 5 above.

       7.  If the withdrawing member is indebted to the Fund as the result of transactions conducted through the Special Disbursement Account under Article V, Section 12 (_f_) (ii), the indebtedness shall be discharged in accordance with the terms of the indebtedness.

       8.  If the Fund holds the withdrawing member’s currency in the Special Disbursement Account or in the Investment Account, the Fund may in an orderly manner exchange in any market for the currencies of members the amount of the currency of the withdrawing member remaining in each account after use under 1 above, and the proceeds of the exchange of the amount in each account shall be kept in that account. Paragraph 5 above and the first sentence of 6 above shall apply to the withdrawing member’s currency.

       9.  If the Fund holds obligations of the withdrawing member in the Special Disbursement Account pursuant to Article V, Section 12 (_h_), or in the Investment Account, the Fund may hold them until the date of maturity or dispose of them sooner. Paragraph 8 above shall apply to the proceeds of such disinvestment.

     10.  In the event of the Fund going into liquidation under Article XXVII, Section 2 within six months of the date on which the member withdraws, the accounts between the Fund and that government shall be settled in accordance with Article XXVII, Section 2 and Schedule K.

ADMINISTRATION OF LIQUIDATION

       1.  In the event of liquidation the liabilities of the Fund other than the repayment of subscriptions shall have priority in the distribution of the assets of the Fund. In meeting each such liability the Fund shall use its assets in the following order:

            (_a_)        the currency in which the liability is payable;

            (_b_)        gold;

            (_c_) all other currencies in proportion, so far as may be practicable, to the quotas of the members.

       2.  After the discharge of the Fund’s liabilities in accordance with 1 above, the balance of the Fund’s assets shall be distributed and apportioned as follows:

       (_a_) (i)   The Fund shall calculate the value of gold held on August 31, 1975 that it continues to hold on the date of the decision to liquidate. The calculation shall be made in accordance with 9 below and also on the basis of one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of fine gold on the date of liquidation. Gold equivalent to the excess of the former value over the latter shall be distributed to those members that were members on August 31, 1975 in proportion to their quotas on that date.

            (ii)   The Fund shall distribute any assets held in the Special Disbursement Account on the date of the decision to liquidate to those members that were members on August 31, 1975 in proportion to their quotas on that date. Each type of asset shall be distributed proportionately to members.

       (_b_)   The Fund shall distribute its remaining holdings of gold among the members whose currencies are held by the Fund in amounts less than their quotas in the proportions, but not in excess of, the amounts by which their quotas exceed the Fund’s holdings of their currencies.

        (_c_)   The Fund shall distribute to each member one‑half the Fund’s holdings of its currency but such distribution shall not exceed fifty percent of its quota.

       (_d_)   The Fund shall apportion the remainder of its holdings of gold and each currency

             (i)   among all members in proportion to, but not in excess of, the amounts due to each member after the distributions under (_b_) and (_c_) above, provided that distribution under 2 (_a_) above shall not be taken into account for determining the amounts due, and

            (ii)   any excess holdings of gold and currency among all the members in proportion to their quotas.

       3.  Each member shall redeem the holdings of its currency apportioned to other members under 2 (_d_) above, and shall agree with the Fund within three months after a decision to liquidate upon an orderly procedure for such redemption.

       4.  If a member has not reached agreement with the Fund within the three‑month period referred to in 3 above, the Fund shall use the currencies of other members apportioned to that member under 2 (_d_) above to redeem the currency of that member apportioned to other members. Each currency apportioned to a member which has not reached agreement shall be used, so far as possible, to redeem its currency apportioned to the members which have made agreements with the Fund under 3 above.

       5.  If a member has reached agreement with the Fund in accordance with 3 above, the Fund shall use the currencies of other members apportioned to that member under 2 (_d_) above to redeem the currency of that member apportioned to other members which have made agreements with the Fund under 3 above. Each amount so redeemed shall be redeemed in the currency of the member to which it was apportioned.

       6.  After carrying out the steps in the preceding paragraphs, the Fund shall pay to each member the remaining currencies held for its account.

       7.  Each member whose currency has been distributed to other members under 6 above shall redeem such currency in the currency of the member requesting redemption, or in such other manner as may be agreed between them. If the members involved do not otherwise agree, the member obligated to redeem shall complete redemption within five years of the date of distribution, but shall not be required to redeem in any half‑yearly period more than one‑tenth of the amount distributed to each other member. If the member does not fulfill this obligation, the amount of currency which should have been redeemed may be liquidated in an orderly manner in any market.

       8.  Each member whose currency has been distributed to other members under 6 above guarantees the unrestricted use of such currency at all times for the purchase of goods or for payment of sums due to it or to persons in its territories. Each member so obligated agrees to compensate other members for any loss resulting from the difference between the value of its currency in terms of the special drawing right on the date of the decision to liquidate the Fund and the value in terms of the special drawing right realized by such members on disposal of its currency.

       9.  The Fund shall determine the value of gold under this Schedule on the basis of prices in the market.

     10.  For the purposes of this Schedule, quotas shall be deemed to have been increased to the full extent to which they could have been increased in accordance with Article III, Section 2 (_b_) of this Agreement.

     (_b_)  Currencies received by the Bank from borrowers or guarantors in payment on account of principal of direct loans made with currencies referred to in (_a_) above shall be exchanged for the currencies of other members or reloaned only with the approval in each case of the members whose currencies are involved; provided, however, that if necessary, after the Bank’s subscribed capital has been entirely called, such currencies shall, without restriction by the members whose currencies are offered, be used or exchanged for the currencies required to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank’s own borrowings, or to meet the Bank’s liabilities with respect to such contractual payments on loans guaranteed by the Bank.

     (_c_)  Currencies received by the Bank from borrowers or guarantors in payment on account of principal of direct loans made by the Bank under Section 1 (_a_) (ii) of this Article, shall be held and used, without restriction by the members, to make amortization payments, or to anticipate payment of or repurchase part or all of the Bank’s own obligations.

     (_d_)  All other currencies available to the Bank, including those raised in the market or otherwise borrowed under Section 1 (_a_) (ii) of this Article, those obtained by the sale of gold, those received as payments of interest and other charges for direct loans made under Sections 1 (_a_) (i) and (ii), and those received as payments of commissions and other charges under Section 1 (_a_) (iii), shall be used or exchanged for other currencies or gold required in the operations of the Bank without restriction by the members whose currencies are offered.

     (_e_)  Currencies raised in the markets of members by borrowers on loans guaranteed by the Bank under Section 1 (_a_) (iii) of this Article, shall also be used or exchanged for other currencies without restriction by such members.

Section 3.  _Provision of currencies for direct loans_

     The following provisions shall apply to direct loans under Sections 1 (_a_) (i) and (ii) of this Article:

     (_a_)  The Bank shall furnish the borrower with such currencies of members, other than the member in whose territories the project is located, as are needed by the borrower for expenditures to be made in the territories of such other members to carry out the purposes of the loan.

     (_b_)  The Bank may, in exceptional circumstances when local currency required for the purposes of the loan cannot be raised by the borrower on reasonable terms, provide the borrower as part of the loan with an appropriate amount of that currency.

     (_c_)  The Bank, if the project gives rise indirectly to an increased need for foreign exchange by the member in whose territories the project is located, may in exceptional circumstances provide the borrower as part of the loan with an appropriate amount of gold or foreign exchange not in excess of the borrower’s local expenditure in connexion with the purposes of the loan.

     (_d_)  The Bank may, in exceptional circumstances, at the request of a member in whose territories a portion of the loan is spent, repurchase with gold or foreign exchange a part of that member’s currency thus spent but in no case shall the part so repurchased exceed the amount by which the expenditure of the loan in those territories gives rise to an increased need for foreign exchange.

Section 4.  _Payment provisions for direct loans_

     Loan contracts under Section 1 (_a_) (i) or (ii) of this Article shall be made in accordance with the following payment provisions:

     (_a_)  The terms and conditions of interest and amortization payments, maturity and dates of payment of each loan shall be determined by the Bank. The Bank shall also determine the rate and any other terms and conditions of commission to be charged in connexion with such loan.

     In the case of loans made under Section 1 (_a_) (ii) of this Article during the first ten years of the Bank’s operations, this rate of commission shall be not less than one percent per annum and not greater than one and one‑half percent per annum, and shall be charged son the outstanding portion of any such loan. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both to the outstanding portions of loans already made and to future loans, if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank shall also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is advisable.

     (_b_)  All loan contracts shall stipulate the currency or currencies in which payments under the contract shall be made to the Bank. At the option of the borrower, however, such payments may be made in gold, or subject to the agreement of the Bank, in the currency of a member other than that prescribed in the contract.

        (i)   In the case of loans made under Section 1 (_a_) (i) of this Article, the loan contracts shall provide that payments to the Bank of interest, other charges and amortization shall be made in the currency loaned, unless the member whose currency is loaned agrees that such payments shall be made in some other specified currency or currencies. These payments, subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 9 (_c_), shall be equivalent to the value of such contractual payments at the time the loans were made, in terms of a currency specified for the purpose by the Bank by a three‑fourths majority of the total voting power.

       (ii)   In the case of loans made under Section 1 (_a_) (ii) of this Article, the total amount outstanding and payable to the Bank in any one currency shall at no time exceed the total amount of the outstanding borrowings made by the Bank under Section 1 (_a_) (ii) and payable in the same currency.

            (_c_)        If a member suffers from an acute exchange stringency, so that the service of any loan contracted by that member or guaranteed by it or by one of its agencies cannot be provided in the stipulated manner, the member concerned may apply to the Bank for a relaxation of the conditions of payment. If the Bank is satisfied that some relaxation is in the interests of the particular member and of the operations of the Bank and of its members as a whole, it may take action under either, or both, of the following paragraphs with respect to the whole, or part, of the annual service:

        (i)   The Bank may, in its discretion, make arrangements with the member concerned to accept service payments on the loan in the member’s currency for periods not to exceed three years upon appropriate terms regarding the use of such currency and the maintenance of its foreign exchange value; and for the repurchase of such currency on appropriate terms.

       (ii)   The Bank may modify the terms of amortization or extend the life of the loan, or both.

Section 5.  _Guarantees_

     (_a_)  In guaranteeing a loan placed through the usual investment channels, the Bank shall charge a guarantee commission payable periodically on the amount of the loan outstanding at a rate determined by the Bank. During the first ten years of the Bank’s operations, this rate shall be not less than one percent per annum and not greater than one and one‑half percent per annum. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both to the outstanding portions of loans already guaranteed and to future loans if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank shall also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is advisable.

     (_b_)  Guarantee commissions shall be paid directly to the Bank by the borrower.

     (_c_)  Guarantees by the Bank shall provide that the Bank may terminate its liability with respect to interest if, upon default by the borrower and by the guarantor, if any, the Bank offers to purchase, at par and interest accrued to a date designated in the offer, the bonds or other obligations guaranteed.

     (_d_)  The Bank shall have power to determine any other terms and conditions of the guarantee.

Section 6.  _Special reserve_

     The amount of commissions received by the Bank under Sections 4 and 5 of this Article shall be set aside as a special reserve, which shall be kept available for meeting liabilities of the Bank in accordance with Section 7 of this Article. The special reserve shall be held in such liquid form, permitted under this Agreement, as the Executive Directors may decide.

Section 7.  _Methods of meeting liabilities of the Bank in case of defaults_

     In cases of default on loans made, participated in, or guaranteed by the Bank:

     (_a_)  The Bank shall make such arrangements as may be feasible to adjust the obligations under the loans, including arrangements under or analogous to those provided in Section 4 (_c_) of this Article.

     (_b_)  The payments in discharge of the Bank’s liabilities on borrowings or guarantees under Sections 1 (_a_) (ii) and (iii) of this Article shall be charged:

        (i)   first, against the special reserve provided in Section 6 of this Article.

       (ii)   then, to the extent necessary and at the discretion of the Bank, against the other reserves, surplus and capital available to the Bank.

     (_c_)  Wherever necessary to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank’s own borrowings, or to meet the Bank’s liabilities with respect to similar payments on loans guaranteed by it, the Bank may call an appropriate amount of the unpaid subscriptions of members in accordance with Article II, Sections 5 and 7\. Moreover, if it believes that a default may be of long duration, the Bank may call an additional amount of such unpaid subscriptions not to exceed in any one year one percent of the total subscriptions of the members for the following purposes:

        (i)   To redeem prior to maturity, or otherwise discharge its liability on, all or part of the outstanding principal of any loan guaranteed by it in respect of which the debtor is in default.

       (ii)   To repurchase, or otherwise discharge its liability on, all or part of its own outstanding borrowings.

Section 8\. _Miscellaneous operations_

     In addition to the operations specified elsewhere in this Agreement, the Bank shall have the power:

        (i)   To buy and sell securities it has issued and to buy and sell securities which it has guaranteed or in which it has invested, provided that the Bank shall obtain the approval of the member in whose territories the securities are to be bought or sold.

       (ii)   To guarantee securities in which it has invested for the purpose of facilitating their sale.

      (iii)   To borrow the currency of any member with the approval of that member.

      (iv)   To buy and sell such other securities as the Directors by a three‑fourths majority of the total voting power may deem proper for the investment of all or part of the special reserve under Section 6 of this Article.

In exercising the powers conferred by this Section, the Bank may deal with any person, partnership, association, corporation or other legal entity in the territories of any member.

Section 9.  _Warning to be placed on securities_

     Every security guaranteed or issued by the Bank shall bear on its face a conspicuous statement to the effect that it is not an obligation of any government unless expressly stated on the security.

Section 10.  _Political activity prohibited_

     The Bank and its officers shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned. Only economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions, and these considerations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve the purposes stated in Article I.

Initially, at least one‑half of the gold holdings of the Bank shall be held in the depository designated by the member in whose territory the Bank has its principal office, and at least forty percent shall be held in the depositories designated by the remaining four members referred to above, each of such depositories to hold, initially, not less than the amount of gold paid on the shares of the member designating it. However, all transfers of gold by the Bank shall be made with due regard to the costs of transport and anticipated requirements of the Bank. In an emergency the Executive Directors may transfer all or any part of the Bank’s gold holdings to any place where they can be adequately protected.

If two percent is paid as a first charge, any balance remaining to be distributed shall be paid to all members in proportion to their shares. Payments to each member shall be made in its own currency, or if that currency is not available in other currency acceptable to the member. If such payments are made in currencies other than the member’s own currency, the transfer of the currency and its use by the receiving member after payment shall be without restriction by the members.

ARTICLE VI

     If a member fails to fulfill any of its obligations to the Bank, the Bank may suspend its membership by decision of a majority of the Governors, exercising a majority of the total voting power. The member so suspended shall automatically cease to be a member one year from the date of its suspension unless a decision is taken by the same majority to restore the member to good standing.

Section 3.  _Cessation of membership in International Monetary Fund_

     Any member which ceases to be a member of the International Monetary Fund shall automatically cease after three months to be a member of the Bank unless the Bank by three‑fourths of the total voting power has agreed to allow it to remain a member.

Section 4.  _Settlement of accounts with governments ceasing to be members_

     (_a_)  When a government ceases to be a member, it shall remain liable for its direct obligations to the Bank and for its contingent liabilities to the Bank so long as any part of the loans or guarantees contracted before it ceased to be a member are outstanding; but it shall cease to incur liabilities with respect to loans and guarantees entered into thereafter by the Bank and to share either in the income or the expenses of the Bank.

     (_b_)  At the time a government ceases to be a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of its shares as a part of the settlement of accounts with such government in accordance with the provisions of (_c_) and (_d_) below. For the purpose the repurchase price of the shares shall be the value shown by the books of the Bank on the day the government ceases to be a member.

     (_c_)  The payment for shares repurchased by the Bank under this section shall be governed by the following conditions:

        (i)   Any amount due to the government for its shares shall be withheld so long as the government, its central bank or any of its agencies remains liable, as borrower or guarantor, to the Bank and such amount may, at the option of the Bank, be applied on any such liability as it matures. No amount shall be withheld on account of the liability of the government resulting from its subscription for shares under Article II, Section 5 (ii). In any event, no amount due to a member for its shares shall be paid until six months after the date upon which the government ceases to be a member.

       (ii)   Payments for shares may be made from time to time, upon their surrender by the government, to the extent by which the amount due as the repurchase price in (_b_) above exceeds the aggregate of liabilities on loans and guarantees in (_c_) (i) above until the former member has received the full repurchase price.

      (iii)   Payments shall be made in the currency of the country receiving payment or at the option of the Bank in gold.

      (iv)   If losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees, participations in loans, or loans which were outstanding on the date when the government ceased to be a member, and the amount of such losses exceeds the amount of the reserve provided against losses on the date when the government ceased to be a member, such government shall be obligated to repay upon demand the amount by which the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced, if the losses had been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member government shall remain liable on any call for unpaid subscriptions under Article II, Section 5 (ii), to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

     (_d_)  If the Bank suspends permanently its operations under Section 5 (_b_) of this Article, within six months of the date upon which any government ceases to be a member, all rights of such government shall be determined by the provisions of Section 5 of this Article.

Section 5.  _Suspension of operations and settlement of obligations_

     (_b_)  The Bank may suspend permanently its operations in respect of new loans and guarantees by vote of a majority of the Governors, exercising a majority of the total voting power. After such suspension of operations the Bank shall forthwith cease all activities, except those incident to the orderly realization, conservation, and preservation of its assets and settlement of its obligations.

     (_c_)  The liability of all members for uncalled subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank and in respect of the depreciation of their own currencies shall continue until all claims of creditors, including all contingent claims, shall have been discharged.

     (_d_)  All creditors holding direct claims shall be paid out of the assets of the Bank, and then out of payments to the Bank on calls on unpaid subscriptions. Before making any payments to creditors holding direct claims, the Executive Directors shall make such arrangements as are necessary, in their judgment, to insure a distribution to holders of contingent claims ratably with creditors holding direct claims.

     (_e_)  No distribution shall be made to members on account of their subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank until

        (i)   all liabilities to creditors have been discharged or provided for, and

       (ii)   a majority of the Governors, exercising a majority of the total voting power have decided to make a distribution.

      (_f_)  After a decision to make a distribution has been taken under (_e_) above, the Executive Directors may by a two‑thirds majority vote make successive distributions of the assets of the Bank to members until all of the assets have been distributed. This distribution shall be subject to the prior settlement of all outstanding claims of the Bank against each member.

     (_g_)  Before any distribution of assets is made, the Executive Directors shall fix the proportionate share of each member according to the ratio of its shareholding to the total outstanding shares of the Bank.

     (_h_)  The Executive Directors shall value the assets to be distributed as at the date of distribution and then proceed to distribute in the following manner:

        (i)   There shall be paid to each member in its own obligations or those of its official agencies or legal entities within its territories, insofar as they are available for distribution, an amount equivalent in value to its proportionate share of the total amount to be distributed.

       (ii)   Any balance due to a member after payment has been made under (i) above shall be paid, in its own currency, insofar as it is held by the Bank, up to an amount equivalent in value to such balance.

      (iii)   Any balance due to a member after payment has been made under (i) and (ii) above shall be paid in gold or currency acceptable to the member, insofar as they are held by the Bank, up to an amount equivalent in value to such balance.

      (iv)   Any remaining assets held by the Bank after payments have been made to members under (i), (ii), and (iii) above shall be distributed _pro rata_ among the members.

      (_i_)  Any member receiving assets distributed by the Bank in accordance with (_h_) above, shall enjoy the same rights with respect to such assets as the Bank enjoyed prior to their distribution.

If the proposed amendment is approved by the Board the Bank shall, by circular letter or telegram, ask all members whether they accept the proposed amendment.

ARTICLE IX

INTERPRETATION

     (_a_)  Any question of interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement arising between any member and the Bank or between any members of the Bank shall be submitted to the Executive Directors for their decision. If the question particularly affects any member not entitled to appoint an executive director, it shall be entitled to representation in accordance with Article V, Section 4 (_h_).

     (_b_)  In any case where the Executive Directors have given a decision under (_a_) above, any member may require that the question be referred to the Board of Governors, whose decision shall be final. Pending the result of the reference to the Board, the Bank may, so far as it deems necessary, act on the basis of the decision of the Executive Directors.

     (_c_)  Whenever a disagreement arises between the Bank and a country which has ceased to be a member, or between the Bank and any member during the permanent suspension of the Bank, such disagreement shall be submitted to arbitration by a tribunal of three arbitrators, one appointed by the Bank, another by the country involved and an umpire who, unless the parties otherwise agree, shall be appointed by the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice or such other authority as may have been prescribed by regulation adopted by the Bank. The umpire shall have full power to settle all questions of procedure in any case where the parties are in disagreement with respect thereto.

ARTICLE X

APPROVAL DEEMED GIVEN

ARTICLE XI

FINAL PROVISIONS

Section 1.  _Entry into force_

     This Agreement shall enter into force when it has been signed on behalf of governments whose minimum subscriptions comprise not less than sixty‑five percent of the total subscriptions set forth in Schedule A and when the instruments referred to in Section 2 (_a_) of this Article have been deposited on their behalf, but in no event shall this Agreement enter into force before May 1, 1945.

Section 2.  _Signature_

     (_a_)  Each government on whose behalf this Agreement is signed shall deposit with the Government of the United States of America an instrument setting forth that it has accepted this Agreement in accordance with its law and has taken all steps necessary to enable it to carry out all of its obligations under this Agreement.

     (_b_)  Each government shall become a member of the Bank as from the date of the deposit on its behalf of the instrument referred to in (_a_) above, except that no government shall become a member before this Agreement enters into force under Section 1 of this Article.

     (_c_)  The Government of the United States of America shall inform the governments of all countries whose names are set forth in Schedule A, and all governments whose membership is approved in accordance with Article II, Section 1 (_b_), of all signatures of this Agreement and of the deposit of all instruments referred to in (_a_) above.

     (_d_)  At the time this Agreement is signed on its behalf, each government shall transmit to the Government of the United States of America one one‑hundredth of one percent of the price of each share in gold or United States dollars for the purpose of meeting administrative expenses of the Bank. This payment shall be credited on account of the payment to be made in accordance with Article II, Section 8 (_a_). The Government of the United States of America shall hold such funds in a special deposit account and shall transmit them to the Board of Governors of the Bank when the initial meeting has been called under Section 3 of this Article. If this Agreement has not come into force by December 31, 1945, the Government of the United States of America shall return such funds to the governments that transmitted them.

     (_e_)  This Agreement shall remain open for signature at Washington on behalf of the governments of the countries whose names are set forth in Schedule A until December 31, 1945.

      (_f_)  After  December 31, 1945, this Agreement shall be open for signature on behalf of the government of any country whose membership has been approved in accordance with Article II, Section 1 (_b_).

     (_g_)  By their signature of this Agreement, all governments accept it both on their own behalf and in respect of all their colonies, overseas territories, all territories under their protection, suzerainty, or authority and all territories in respect of which they exercise a mandate.

     (_h_)  In the case of governments whose metropolitan territories have been under enemy occupation, the deposit of the instrument referred to in (_a_) above may be delayed until one hundred and eighty days after the date on which these territories have been liberated. If, however, it is not deposited by any such government before the expiration of this period, the signature affixed on behalf of that government shall become void and the portion of its subscription paid under (_d_) above shall be returned to it.

      (_i_)  Paragraphs (_d_) and (_h_) shall come into force with regard to each signatory government as from the date of its signature.

Section 3.  _Inauguration of the Bank_

     (_a_)  As soon as this Agreement enters into force under Section 1 of this Article, each member shall appoint a governor and the member to whom the largest number of shares is allocated in Schedule A shall call the first meeting of the Board of Governors.

     (_b_)  At the first meeting of the Board of Governors, arrangements shall be made for the selection of provisional executive directors. The governments of the five countries, to which the largest number of shares are allocated in Schedule A, shall appoint provisional executive directors. If one or more of such governments have not become members, the executive directorships which they would be entitled to fill shall remain vacant until they become members, or until January 1, 1946, whichever is the earlier. Seven provisional executive directors shall be elected in accordance with the provisions of Schedule B and shall remain in office until the date of the first regular election of executive directors which shall be held as soon as practicable after January 1, 1946.

     (_d_)  The Bank shall notify members when it is ready to commence operations.

     DONE at Washington, in a single copy which shall remain deposited in the archives of the Government of the United States of America, which shall transmit certified copies to all governments whose names are set forth in Schedule A and to all governments whose membership is approved in accordance with Article II, Section 1 (_b_).

       1.  The election of the elective executive directors shall be by ballot of the Governors eligible to vote under Article V, Section 4 (_b_).

       2.  In balloting for the elective executive directors, each governor eligible to vote shall cast for one person all of the votes to which the member appointing him is entitled under Section 3 of Article V. The seven persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be executive directors, except that no person who receives less than fourteen percent of the total of the votes which can be cast (eligible votes) shall be considered elected.

       3.  When seven persons are not elected on the first ballot, a second ballot shall be held in which the person who received the lowest number of votes shall be ineligible for election and in which there shall vote only (_a_) those governors who voted in the first ballot for a person not elected and (_b_) those governors whose votes for a person elected are deemed under 4 below to have raised the votes cast for that person above fifteen percent of the eligible votes.

       4.  In determining whether the votes cast by a governor are to be deemed to have raised the total of any person above fifteen percent of the eligible votes, the fifteen percent shall be deemed to include, first, the votes of the governor casting the largest number of votes for such person, then the votes of the governor casting the next largest number, and so on until fifteen percent is reached.

       5.  Any governor, part of whose votes must be counted in order to raise the total of any person above fourteen percent, shall be considered as casting all of his votes for such person even if the total votes for such person thereby exceed fifteen percent.

       6.  If, after the second ballot, seven persons have not been elected, further ballots shall be held on the same principles until seven persons have been elected, provided that after six persons are elected, the seventh may be elected by a simple majority of the remaining votes and shall be deemed to have been elected by all such votes.

_Note:       See subsection 3(1)._

**New Arrangements to Borrow**

_Preamble_

In order to enable the International Monetary Fund (the “Fund”) to fulfill more effectively its role in the international monetary system, a number of countries with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system have agreed to provide resources to the Fund up to specified amounts in accordance with the terms and conditions of this decision. As the Fund is a quota‑based institution, the credit arrangements provided for under the terms of this decision shall only be drawn upon when quota resources need to be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system. In order to give effect to these intentions, the following terms and conditions are adopted under Article VII, Section 1(i) of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.

Paragraph 1\. _Definitions_

(a)        As used in this decision the term:

(i)         “amount of a credit arrangement” means the maximum amount expressed in special drawing rights that a participant undertakes to make available to the Fund under a credit arrangement;

(ii)        “Articles” means the Articles of Agreement of the Fund;

(iii)       “available commitment” means a participant’s credit arrangement less any drawn and outstanding balances;

(iv)       “borrowed currency” or “currency borrowed” means currency transferred to the Fund’s account under a credit arrangement;

(v)        “call” means a notice by the Fund to a participant to make a transfer under its credit arrangement to the Fund’s account;

(vi)       “credit arrangement” means an undertaking to provide resources to the Fund on the terms and conditions of this decision;

(vii)      “currency actually convertible” means currency included in the Fund’s quarterly financial transactions plan for transfers;

(viii)     “drawer” means a member that purchases borrowed currency from the General Resources Account of the Fund;

(ix)       “indebtedness of the Fund” means the amount the Fund is committed to repay under a credit arrangement;

(x)        “member” means a member of the Fund;

(xi)       “participant” means a participating member or a participating institution;

(xii)      “participating institution” means an official institution of a member that has entered into a credit arrangement with the Fund with the consent of the member; and

(xiii)     “participating member” means a member that has entered into a credit arrangement with the Fund.

(b)        For the purposes of this decision, the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong (the “HKMA”) shall be regarded as an official institution of the member whose territories include Hong Kong, provided that:

(i)         loans by the HKMA and payments by the Fund to the HKMA under this decision shall be made in the currency of the United States of America, unless the currency of another member is agreed between the Fund and the HKMA;

(ii)        the references to balance of payments and reserve position in paragraphs 5(c), 6(b), 6(c), 7(a), and 11(e) shall be understood to refer to the balance of payments and reserve position of Hong Kong. The HKMA shall not be eligible to vote on a proposal for activation under paragraph 5(c), included in a resources mobilization plan under paragraph 6(b), or subject to calls under paragraph 7(a), and shall be excluded from calls in accordance with paragraph 6(c), if, at the time of voting on any such proposal, approval of any such resource mobilization plan, or making of any such call, the HKMA notifies the Fund that Hong Kong’s present and prospective balance of payments and reserve position does not allow it to meet calls under its credit arrangement; and

(iii)       the HKMA shall have the right to request early repayment in accordance with paragraph 13(c) with respect to claims transferred to the HKMA if at the time of the transfer the balance of payments position of Hong Kong is, in the opinion of the Fund, sufficiently strong to justify such a right.

Paragraph 2\. _Credit Arrangements_

(a)        A member or institution that adheres to this decision undertakes to provide resources to the Fund on the terms and conditions of this decision up to the amount in special drawing rights set forth in Annex I to this decision (“Annex I”), which may be amended from time to time in order to take into account changes in credit arrangements resulting from the application of paragraphs 3(b), 4, 15(b), 16, 17 and 19(b).

(b)        Except as set forth in paragraph 1(b)(i) or otherwise agreed with the Fund, resources provided to the Fund under this decision shall be made in the currency of the participant. Agreements under this paragraph for the use of the currency of another member shall be subject to the concurrence of any member whose currency shall be used.

Paragraph 3\. _Adherence_

(a)        Any member or institution specified in Annex I as a new participant may adhere to this decision in accordance with paragraph 3(c).

(b)        Any member or institution not specified in Annex I, may apply to become a participant at any time. Any such member or institution that wishes to become a participant shall, after consultation with the Fund, give notice of its willingness to adhere to this decision, and, if the Fund and participants representing 85 percent of total credit arrangements shall so agree, the member or institution may adhere in accordance with paragraph 3(c). When giving notice of its willingness to adhere under this paragraph 3(b), a member or institution shall specify the amount, expressed in special drawing rights, of the credit arrangement which it is willing to enter into, provided that the amount shall not be less than the credit arrangement of the participant with the smallest credit arrangement. The admission of a new participant shall lead to a proportional reduction in the credit arrangements of all existing participants whose credit arrangements are above that of the participant with the smallest credit arrangement: such proportional reduction in the credit arrangements of participants shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the new participant’s credit arrangement less any increase in total credit arrangements decided in accordance with paragraph 4(a), provided that no participant’s credit arrangement shall be reduced below the minimum amount set out in Annex I.

(c)        A member or institution shall adhere to this decision by depositing with the Fund an instrument setting forth that it has adhered in accordance with its law and has taken all steps necessary to enable it to carry out the terms and conditions of this decision. On the deposit of the instrument the member or institution shall be a participant as of the date of the deposit or of the effective date of the amendments to this decision set out in Executive Board Decision No. 14577‑(10/35), adopted on April 12, 2010, whichever is later.

Paragraph 4\. _Changes in Amounts of Credit Arrangements_

(a)        When a member or institution is authorized under paragraph 3(b) to adhere to this decision, the total amount of credit arrangements may be increased by the Fund with the agreement of participants representing 85 percent of total credit arrangements; the increase shall not exceed the amount of the new participant’s credit arrangement.

(b)        The amounts of participants’ individual credit arrangements may be reviewed from time to time in the light of developing circumstances and changed with the agreement of the Fund and of participants representing 85 percent of total credit arrangements, including each participant whose credit arrangement is changed. This provision may be amended only with the consent of all participants.

Paragraph 5\. _Activation Period_

(a)        When the Managing Director considers that the Fund’s resources available for the purpose of providing financing to members from the General Resources Account need to be supplemented in order to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system, and after consultations with Executive Directors and participants, the Managing Director may make a proposal for the establishment of an activation period during which the Fund may (i) make commitments under Fund arrangements for which it may make calls on participants under their credit arrangements, and (ii) fund outright purchases by making calls on participants under their credit arrangements; provided that an activation period shall not exceed 6 months, and provided further that the amount covered by calls to fund such commitments under arrangements and outright purchases shall not exceed the maximum amount specified in the proposal. The proposal for the establishment of an activation period shall include information on (i) the overall size of possible Fund arrangements on which discussions are advanced, (ii) the balance between arrangements that are expected to be drawn upon and arrangements that are expected to be precautionary, (iii) additional financing needs that, in the opinion of the Managing Director, may arise during the proposed activation period, and (iv) the mix of quota and NAB resources for purchases from the General Resources Account in the period following the approval of an activation period. The information will be updated quarterly during an activation period.

(b)        If there is not unanimity among the participants, the question whether the participants are prepared to accept the Managing Director’s proposal for the establishment of an activation period in accordance with paragraph 5(a) will be decided by a poll of the participants. A favorable decision shall require an 85 percent majority of total credit arrangements of participants eligible to vote. The decision shall be notified to the Fund.

(c)        A participant shall not be eligible to vote if, based on its present and prospective balance of payments and reserve position, the member is not included in the financial transactions plan for transfers of its currency at the time of the decision on a proposal for an activation period.

(d)        An activation period shall become effective only if it is accepted by participants pursuant to paragraph 5(b) and is then approved by the Executive Board.

Paragraph 6\. _Resource Mobilization Plans and Calls_

(a)        To fund outright purchases during an activation period and commitments under arrangements approved during an activation period, calls under individual credit arrangements of participants may be made on the basis of resource mobilization plans approved by the Executive Board normally on a quarterly basis in conjunction with the quarterly financial transactions plan for the General Resources Account. Such resource mobilization plans shall specify for each participant the maximum amount for which calls may be made during the applicable period. The Executive Board may at any time amend such a plan to change the maximum amounts and period for calls. With respect to the allocation of the maximum amounts among participants, the resource mobilization plan shall normally establish an allocation that would result in the available commitments of participants being of equal proportion relative to their credit arrangements.

(b)        A participant shall not be included in the resource mobilization plan when, based on its present and prospective balance of payments and reserve position, the member is not included and is not being proposed by the Managing Director to be included in the list of countries in the quarterly financial transactions plan for transfers of its currency.

(c)        Calls during the period of a resource mobilization plan shall be made on participants by the Managing Director with due regard to the objective specified in paragraph 6(a) of achieving available commitments of participants that are of equal proportion relative to their credit arrangements. No call shall be made on a participant that has been included in the resource mobilization plan if, at the time of such call, the member’s currency is not being used in transfers under the financial transactions plan because of the member’s balance of payments and reserve position.

(d)        When the Fund makes a call pursuant to this paragraph 6, the participant shall promptly make the transfer in accordance with the call.

Paragraph 7\. _Procedures for Special Calls_

(a)        Calls pursuant to paragraph 11(e) may be made at any time with due regard to the objective specified in paragraph 6(a) of achieving available commitments of participants that are of equal proportion relative to their credit arrangements, provided that no such call shall be made on a participant, when, based on its present and prospective balance of payments and reserve position, the member is not included and is not being proposed by the Managing Director to be included in the list of countries in the quarterly financial transactions plan for transfers of its currency or, if the member has been included in the financial transactions plan, when, at the time of such call, the member’s currency is not being used in transfers under such plan because of the member’s balance of payments and reserve position. Calls under this paragraph 7(a) shall not be subject to the procedures set forth in either paragraph 5 or paragraph 6.

(b)        Calls pursuant to paragraph 23 may be made at any time; they shall not be subject to the procedures set forth in either paragraph 5 or paragraph 6.

(c)        When the Fund makes a call pursuant to this paragraph 7, the participant shall promptly make the transfer in accordance with the call.

Paragraph 8\. _Nature and Evidence of Indebtedness_

(a)        A participant’s claim on the Fund arising from calls under this decision shall be in the form of a loan to the Fund; provided that, at the request of a participant, the Fund shall issue to the participant and the participant shall purchase, for up to the amount of any call on that participant, one or more promissory notes (each a “Note” or together the “Notes”) that have the same substantive terms as loans extended under this decision and are subject to the General Terms and Conditions for NAB Notes set forth in Annex II to this decision (the “GTC”). The GTC may be amended by a decision of the Fund with the agreement of participants representing 85 percent of total credit arrangements, provided that any amendment of the GTC shall be consistent with the terms of this decision. The amended GTC shall apply upon effectiveness to all outstanding Notes issued under this decision.

(b)        In cases where a participant’s claim on the Fund is in the form of a loan, the Fund shall issue to the participant, at its request, instruments evidencing the Fund’s indebtedness. The form of the instruments shall be agreed between the Fund and the participant. Upon repayment of the amount of any such instrument and all accrued interest, the instrument shall be returned to the Fund for cancellation. If less than the amount of any such instrument is repaid, the instrument shall be returned to the Fund and a new instrument for the remainder of the amount shall be substituted with the same maturity date as in the old instrument.

(c)        In cases where a participant’s claim on the Fund is in the form of Notes, such Notes shall be issued in book entry form. Upon the request of a participant, the Fund shall issue a registered Note substantially in the form as set out in the Appendix to the GTC. Upon repayment of any Note and all accrued interest, the Note shall be returned to the Fund for cancellation. If less than the amount of any such Note is repaid, the Note shall be returned to the Fund and a new Note for the remainder of the amount shall be substituted with the same maturity date as in the old Note.

Paragraph 9\. _Interest_

(a)        The Fund shall pay interest on its indebtedness under this decision at a rate equal to the combined market interest rate computed by the Fund from time to time for the purpose of determining the rate at which it pays interest on holdings of special drawing rights or any such higher rate as may be agreed between the Fund and participants representing 85 percent of the total credit arrangements.

(b)        Interest shall accrue daily and shall be paid as soon as possible after each July 31, October 31, January 31, and April 30.

(c)        Interest due to a participant shall be paid, as determined by the Fund in consultation with the participant, in special drawing rights, in the participant’s currency, in the currency borrowed, in freely usable currencies, or, with the agreement of the participant, in other currencies that are actually convertible.

Paragraph 10\. _Use of Borrowed Currency_

The Fund’s policies and practices under Article V, Sections 3 and 7 of the Articles on the use of its general resources, including those relating to the period of use, shall apply to purchases of currency borrowed by the Fund. Nothing in this decision shall affect the authority of the Fund with respect to requests for the use of its resources by individual members, and access to these resources by members shall be determined by the Fund’s policies and practices, and shall not depend on whether the Fund can borrow under this decision.

Paragraph 11\. _Repayment by the Fund_

(a)        Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph 11, the Fund, five years after a transfer by a participant in response to a call under this decision, shall repay the participant an amount equivalent to the transfer calculated in accordance with paragraph 12\. If a drawer for whose purchase resources were made available under this decision repurchases on a date earlier than five years after its purchase, the Fund shall repay participants an equivalent amount during the quarterly period in which the repurchase is made in accordance with paragraph 11(d). Repayment under this paragraph 11(a) or under paragraph 11(c) shall be, as determined by the Fund, in the currency borrowed whenever feasible, in the currency of the participant, in special drawing rights in an amount that does not increase the participant’s holdings of special drawing rights above the limit under Article XIX, Section 4 of the Articles unless the participant agrees to accept special drawing rights above that limit in such repayment, in freely usable currencies, or, with the agreement of the participant, in other currencies that are actually convertible.

(b)        Before the date prescribed in paragraph 1l(a), the Fund, after consultation with participants, may make repayment in part or in full to one or several participants in accordance with paragraph 11(d). The Fund shall have the option to make repayment under this paragraph 11(b) in the participant’s currency, in the currency borrowed, in special drawing rights in an amount that does not increase the participant’s holdings of special drawing rights above the limit under Article XIX, Section 4 of the Articles unless the participant agrees to accept special drawing rights above that limit in such repayment, in freely usable currencies, or, with the agreement of the participant, in other currencies that are actually convertible.

(c)        Whenever a reduction in the Fund’s holdings of a drawer’s currency is attributed to a purchase of currency borrowed under this decision, the Fund shall promptly repay an equivalent amount to participants. If the Fund has used resources under this decision to finance a reserve tranche purchase by a drawer and the Fund’s holdings of the drawer’s currency that are not subject to repurchase are reduced as a result of net sales of that currency during a quarterly period covered by a financial transactions plan, the Fund shall repay at the beginning of the next quarterly period an amount equivalent to that reduction to participants, up to the amount of the reserve tranche purchase. Payments under this paragraph 11(c) shall be allocated among participants in accordance with paragraph 11(d).

(d)        Repayments under paragraphs 11(a), second sentence, 11(b) and 11(c) shall be allocated among participants with due regard to the objective specified in paragraph 6(a) of achieving available commitments of participants that are of equal proportion relative to their credit arrangements. For each participant, repayments shall be applied first to the longest outstanding claim under its credit arrangement. If repayment is to be made in accordance with this paragraph 11(d) on a claim that has been transferred, the repayment shall be made to the transferee of such claim.

(e)        Before the date prescribed in paragraph 11(a), a participant may give notice representing that there is a balance of payments need for repayment of part or all of the Fund’s indebtedness and requesting such repayment. The participant seeking such repayment shall consult with the Managing Director and with the other participants before giving notice. The Fund shall give the overwhelming benefit of any doubt to the participant’s representation. Repayment shall be made promptly after consultation with the participant in freely usable currencies or in special drawing rights, as determined by the Fund, or, with the agreement of the participant, in the currencies of other members that are actually convertible. If the Fund’s holdings of currencies in which repayment should be made are not wholly adequate, the Managing Director shall make calls on individual participants to provide the necessary balances under their credit arrangements subject to the limit of their available commitments. At the time of such call, and if so requested by the participant seeking early repayment, (i) a participant providing balances under its credit arrangement that are not balances of a freely usable currency shall ensure that such balances can be exchanged for a freely usable currency of its choice, and (ii) a participant providing balances under its credit arrangement that are balances of a freely usable currency, shall collaborate with the Fund and other members to enable such balances to be exchanged for another freely usable currency.

(f)        When a repayment is made on a claim arising from a call under this decision, the amount that can be called for under the credit arrangement of the participant under which the claim arose as a result of a call under this decision shall be restored pro tanto.

(g)        Unless otherwise agreed between the Fund and a participating institution, the Fund shall be deemed to have discharged its obligations to a participating institution to make repayment in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 11 or to pay interest in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 if the Fund transfers an equivalent amount in special drawing rights to the member in which the participating institution is established.

Paragraph 12\. _Rates of Exchange_

(a)        The value of any transfer shall be calculated as of the date of the dispatch of the instructions for the transfer. The calculation shall be made in terms of the special drawing right in accordance with Article XIX, Section 7(a) of the Articles, and the Fund shall be obliged to repay an equivalent value.

(b)        For all of the purposes of this decision, the value of a currency in terms of the special drawing right shall be calculated by the Fund in accordance with Rule O‑2 of the Fund’s Rules and Regulations.

Paragraph 13\. _Transferability_

(a)        No participant or non‑participant holder may transfer all or any part of its claim to repayment under a credit arrangement except (i) in accordance with this paragraph 13 or (ii) with the prior consent of the Fund and on such terms and conditions as the Fund may approve.

(b)        All or part of any claim to repayment under a credit arrangement may be transferred at any time to a participant or to a non‑participant that is either (i) a member of the Fund, (ii) the central bank or other fiscal agency designated by any member for purposes of Article V, Section 1 of the Articles (“other fiscal agency”), or (iii) an official entity that has been prescribed as a holder of special drawing rights pursuant to Article XVII, Section 3 of the Articles.

(c)        As from the value date of the transfer, the transferred claim shall be held by the transferee on the same terms and conditions as claims originating under its credit arrangement (in the case of transferees that are participants) or as the claim was held by the transferor (in the case of transferees that are non‑participants), except that (i) the transferee shall have the right to request early repayment of the transferred claim on balance of payments grounds pursuant to paragraph 11(e) only if the transferee is a member, or an institution of a member, whose balance of payments and reserve position, at the time of the transfer, is considered sufficiently strong for its currency to be usable in transfers under the Fund’s financial transactions plan; (ii) if the transferee is a non‑participant, references to the participant’s currency shall be deemed to refer (A) if the transferee is a member, to the transferee’s currency, (B) if the transferee is an institution of a member, to the currency of that member, and (C) in other cases, to a freely usable currency as determined by the Fund; and (iii) claims transferred in accordance with this paragraph 13 shall be considered drawn balances of the first transferor participant for purposes of determining the available commitment under its credit arrangement, and claims obtained by a participant under a transfer shall not be considered drawn balances of the transferee for purposes of determining the available commitment under its credit arrangement.

(d)        The price for the claim transferred shall be as agreed between the transferee and the transferor.

(e)        The transferor of a claim shall inform the Fund promptly of the claim that is being transferred, the name of the transferee, the amount of the claim that is being transferred, the agreed price for transfer of the claim, and the value date of the transfer.

(f)        The transfer shall be registered by the Fund and the transferee shall become the holder of the claim if the transfer is in accordance with the terms and conditions of this decision. Subject to the foregoing, the transfer shall be effective as of the value date agreed between the transferee and the transferor.

(g)        Notice to or by a transferee that is a non‑participant shall be in writing or by rapid means of communication and shall be given to or by the fiscal agency designated by the transferee in accordance with Article V, Section 1 of the Articles and Rule G‑1 of the Rules and Regulations of the Fund if the transferee is a member, or to or by the transferee directly if the transferee is not a member.

(h)        If all or part of a claim is transferred during a quarterly period as described in paragraph 9(b), the Fund shall pay interest to the transferee on the amount of the claim transferred for the whole of that period.

(i)         Unless otherwise agreed between the Fund and a transferee that is either a participating institution or the central bank or other fiscal agency designated by any member for purposes of Article V, Section 1 of the Articles, the Fund shall be deemed to have discharged its obligations to make repayment to such transferee in special drawing rights in accordance with paragraph 11 or to pay interest in special drawing rights in accordance with paragraph 9 if the Fund transfers an equivalent amount in special drawing rights to the account of the member in which the institution is established.

(j)         If requested, the Fund shall assist in seeking to arrange transfers.

(k)        The transferee of a claim may request at the time of transfer that a claim in the form of a loan be exchanged by the Fund for a Note on the same substantive terms subject to the GTC, or that a claim in the form of a Note be exchanged for a loan claim on the same substantive terms. (l) Derivative transactions in respect of any claim under this decision, and transfer of participation interests in any claim, are prohibited.

Paragraph 14\. _Notices_

Notice to or by a participating member under this decision shall be in writing or by rapid means of communication and shall be given to or by the fiscal agency of the participating member designated in accordance with Article V, Section 1 of the Articles and Rule G‑1 of the Rules and Regulations of the Fund. Notice to or by a participating institution shall be in writing or by rapid means of communication and shall be given to or by the participating institution.

Paragraph 15\. _Amendment_

(a)        Except as provided in paragraphs 4(b), 15(b) and 16, this decision may be amended during the period prescribed in paragraph 19(a) and any subsequent renewal periods that may be decided pursuant to paragraph 19(b) only by a decision of the Fund and with the concurrence of participants representing 85 percent of total credit arrangements. Such concurrence shall not be necessary for the modification of the decision on its renewal pursuant to paragraph 19(b).

(b)        If in its view an amendment materially affects the interest of a participant that voted against the amendment, the participant shall have the right to withdraw its adherence to this decision by giving notice to the Fund and the other participants within 90 days from the date the amendment was adopted. This provision may be amended only with the consent of all participants.

Paragraph 16\. _Withdrawal of Adherence_

Without prejudice to paragraph 15(b), a participant may withdraw its adherence to this decision in accordance with paragraph 19(b) but may not withdraw within the period prescribed in paragraph 19(a) except with the agreement of the Fund and all participants. This provision may be amended only with the consent of all participants.

Paragraph 17\. _Withdrawal from Membership_

If a participating member or a member whose institution is a participant withdraws from membership in the Fund, the participant’s credit arrangement shall cease at the same time as the withdrawal takes effect. The Fund’s indebtedness under the relevant credit arrangement shall be treated as an amount due from the Fund for the purpose of Article XXVI, Section 3 and Schedule J of the Articles.

Paragraph 18\. _Suspension of Exchange Transactions and Liquidation_

(a)        The right of the Fund to make calls under paragraphs 6, 11(e), and 23 and the obligation to make repayments under paragraph 11 shall be suspended during any suspension of exchange transactions under Article XXVII of the Articles.

(b)        In the event of liquidation of the Fund, credit arrangements shall cease and the Fund’s indebtedness shall constitute liabilities under Schedule K of the Articles. For the purpose of paragraph 1(a) of Schedule K, the currency in which the liability of the Fund shall be payable shall be first the currency borrowed, then the participant’s currency and finally the currency of the drawer for whose purchases transfers were made by the participants in connection with calls under paragraph 6.

Paragraph 19\. _Period and Renewal_

(a)        This decision shall continue in existence until November 16, 2012\. When considering a renewal of this decision for any period following the period referred to in this paragraph 19(a), the Fund and the participants shall review the functioning of this decision and, in particular, (i) the experience with the procedures for activation and (ii) the impact of the Fourteenth General Review of Quotas on the overall size of quotas, and shall consult on any possible modifications.

(b)        This decision may be renewed for such period or periods and with such modifications, subject to paragraphs 4(b), 15(b) and 16, as the Fund may decide. The Fund shall adopt a decision on renewal and modification, if any, not later than twelve months before the end of the period prescribed in paragraph 19(a). Any participant may advise the Fund not less than six months before the end of the period prescribed in paragraph 19(a) that it will withdraw its adherence to the decision as renewed. In the absence of such notice, a participant shall be deemed to continue to adhere to the decision as renewed. Withdrawal of adherence in accordance with this paragraph 19(b) by a participant shall not preclude its subsequent adherence in accordance with paragraph 3(b).

(c)        If this decision is terminated or not renewed, paragraphs 8 through 14, 17 and 18(b) shall nevertheless continue to apply in connection with any indebtedness of the Fund under credit arrangements in existence at the date of the termination or expiration of the decision until repayment is completed. If a participant withdraws its adherence to this decision in accordance with paragraph 15(b), paragraph 16, or paragraph 19(b), it shall cease to be a participant under the decision, but paragraphs 8 through 14, 17 and 18(b) of the decision as of the date of the withdrawal shall nevertheless continue to apply to any indebtedness of the Fund under such former credit arrangement until repayment has been completed.

Paragraph 20\. _Interpretation_

Any question of interpretation raised in connection with this decision (including the GTC) which does not fall within the purview of Article XXIX of the Articles shall be settled to the mutual satisfaction of the Fund, the participant or transferee of a claim raising the question, and all other participants. For the purpose of this paragraph 20 participants shall be deemed to include those former participants to which paragraphs 8 through 14, 17 and 18(b) continue to apply pursuant to paragraph 19(c) to the extent that any such former participant is affected by a question of interpretation that is raised.

Paragraph 21\. _Relationship with the General Arrangements to Borrow and Associated Borrowing Arrangements_

(a)        When considering whether to activate the New Arrangements to Borrow or the General Arrangements to Borrow, the Fund shall be guided by the principle that the New Arrangements to Borrow shall be the facility of first and principal recourse, except that in the event that a proposal for the establishment of an activation period under the New Arrangements to Borrow is not accepted under paragraph 5(a), a proposal for calls may be made under the General Arrangements to Borrow.

(b)        Outstanding drawings and available commitments under the New Arrangements to Borrow and the General Arrangements to Borrow shall not exceed SDR 367,467.36 million, or such other amount of total credit arrangements as may be in effect in accordance with this decision. The available commitment of a participant under the New Arrangements to Borrow shall be reduced pro tanto by any outstanding drawings on, and commitments of, the participant under the General Arrangements to Borrow. The available commitment of a participant under the General Arrangements to Borrow shall be reduced pro tanto by the extent to which its credit arrangement under the General Arrangements to Borrow exceeds its available commitment under the New Arrangements to Borrow.

(c)        References to drawings and commitments under the General Arrangements to Borrow shall include drawings and commitments under the Associated Borrowing Arrangements referred to in paragraph 23 of the General Arrangements to Borrow.

Paragraph 22\. _Other Borrowing Arrangements_

Nothing in this decision shall preclude the Fund from entering into any other types of borrowing arrangements.

Paragraph 23\. _Transitional Arrangements for Amendments Adopted Pursuant to Decision No. 14577‑(10/35), adopted on April 12, 2010_

At the request of a participant that holds claims, either in the form of loans or notes, on the Fund under bilateral borrowing agreements entered into by the Fund prior to the effectiveness of the amendments to this decision set forth in Decision No. 14577‑(10/35), adopted on April 12, 2010, the Managing Director shall make calls under the credit arrangement of such a participant to fund the repayment of such claims. Similarly, at the request of the relevant participant, calls shall be made on a participant that is a participating institution for the repayment of such claims held by the member of which it is an official institution or by the central bank or other fiscal agency designated by the member, or on a participant that is a member for the repayment of such claims held by the central bank or other fiscal agency designated by the member. Notwithstanding paragraph 11(a), the maturity date of claims under credit arrangements arising from such calls shall be the maturity date of the bilateral borrowing agreement claim for whose repayment the call was made.

Paragraph 24\. _Delay in Drawings_

No drawings shall be made under this decision until participants representing at least 70 percent of the total credit arrangements of new participants listed in Annex I have adhered to this decision in accordance with paragraph 3(c).

**Annex II**

**General Terms and Conditions for Notes Issued by the International Monetary Fund under the New Arrangements to Borrow (the “NAB”)**

These are the General Terms and Conditions for the promissory notes (the “Notes”) issued by the International Monetary Fund (the “Fund”) in accordance with paragraphs 8 and 13(k) of Executive Board Decision No. 11428‑(97/6), January 27, 1997, on the New Arrangements to Borrow (the “NAB Decision”), as amended. Terms that are not otherwise defined in these General Terms and Conditions shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the NAB Decision.

Paragraph 1\. _Issuance of Notes to Participants and Other Holders._

(a)        At the request of a participant pursuant to paragraph 8(a) of the NAB Decision the Fund will issue to the participant, and the participant shall purchase, Notes in the amount requested, up to the amount of the Fund’s call on the participant under its credit arrangement. At the request of the transferee of a loan claim, the Fund will issue Notes to the transferee in exchange for the loan claim pursuant to paragraph 13(k) of the NAB Decision.

(b)        Notes shall be denominated in the special drawing right.

Paragraph 2\. _Form, Delivery and Custody of Notes._

(a)        Notes will be issued in book entry form. The Fund will establish and maintain in its records a book entry account in the name of each holder recording pertinent details of all Notes issued, including the number, issue date, principal amount, and maturity date. As of the value date of each purchase, or of each exchange or transfer of a Note in accordance with paragraph 13 of the NAB Decision, the Fund will make an appropriate entry in its records regarding details of the Note purchased or transferred. The making of such an entry in the records of the Fund shall constitute a taking of delivery of the Note by the purchaser or transferee, and the person so listed with respect to such Note shall be the holder thereof for all purposes.

(b)        Upon the request of a holder, the Fund will issue to the holder a registered Note substantially in the form set out in the Appendix to these General Terms and Conditions, including without limitation the legend regarding restrictions on transfer of Notes. Each such registered Note will bear as its issue date the value date of the purchase of the Note or the value date of the loan claim for which it was exchanged pursuant to paragraph 13(k) of the NAB Decision and shall be issued in the name of the relevant holder. Unless otherwise agreed between a holder and the Fund, the Fund will keep such registered Notes in custody for the holder, and acceptance of custody by the Fund shall constitute delivery of such registered Notes to the holder.

Paragraph 3\. _Interest._

(a)        The Fund shall pay interest on Notes at a rate equal to the combined market interest rate computed by the Fund from time to time for the purpose of determining the rate at which it pays interest on holdings of special drawing rights or any such higher rate as may be agreed between the Fund and participants representing 85 percent of the total credit arrangements under the NAB Decision.

(b)        Interest shall accrue daily and shall be paid as soon as possible after each July 31, October 31, January 31, and April 30\. (c) Interest due to a holder shall be paid, as determined by the Fund in consultation with the holder, in special drawing rights, in the holder’s currency if the holder is a member, in the currency borrowed, in freely usable currencies, or, with the agreement of the holder, in other currencies that are actually convertible.

Paragraph 4\. _Maturity; Repayment by the Fund._

(a)        Notes have a maturity of five years, provided that a Note issued pursuant to paragraph 13(k) of the NAB Decision shall have the maturity of the loan claim for which it was exchanged. Repayment of the Note principal to a holder is made in accordance with paragraph 11 of the NAB Decision.

(b)        Unless otherwise agreed between the Fund and a holder that is either a participating institution or the central bank or other fiscal agency designated by a member for purposes of Article V, Section 1 of the Articles, the Fund shall be deemed to have discharged its obligations to such holder to make repayment in special drawing rights in accordance with paragraph 11 of the NAB Decision or to pay interest in special drawing rights in accordance with paragraph 3 of these General Terms and Conditions, if the Fund transfers an equivalent amount in special drawing rights to the account of the member in which the institution is established.

(c)        The Fund will cancel a Note (i) upon payment of the principal amount of the Note and all accrued interest, (ii) if a Note is transferred in accordance with paragraph 6 of these General Terms and Conditions, or (iii) if a Note is exchanged for a loan claim in accordance with paragraph 13(k) of the NAB Decision. If the Fund makes early payment of less than the principal amount of a Note, the Fund will cancel the Note and issue a new Note for the remainder of the amount.

(d)        Any registered Note to be cancelled by the Fund that is not already in the custody of the Fund shall be surrendered by the holder to the Fund for cancellation.

Paragraph 5\. _Rates of Exchange._

For all of the purposes of these General Terms and Conditions, the value of a currency in terms of the special drawing right shall be calculated by the Fund in accordance with Rule O‑2 of the Fund’s Rules and Regulations.

Paragraph 6\. _Transferability of Notes._

(a)        A holder may not transfer all or any part of its Notes except (i) in accordance with this paragraph 6 or (ii) with the prior consent of the Fund and on such terms and conditions as the Fund may approve. Any other purported transfer by a participant or other holder shall be of no force or effect.

(b)        All or part of any Note may be transferred at any time to a participant or to a non‑participant that is either (i) a member of the Fund, (ii) the central bank or other fiscal agency designated by any member for purposes of Article V, Section 1 of the Articles (“other fiscal agency”), or (iii) an official entity that has been prescribed as a holder of special drawing rights pursuant to Article XVII, Section 3 of the Articles.

(c)        As from the value date of the transfer, the Note shall be held by the transferee on the same terms and conditions as Notes originating under its credit arrangement (in the case of transferees that are participants in the NAB), or as the Note was held by the transferor (in the case of transferees that are non‑participants in the NAB), except that (i) the transferee shall have the right to request early repayment of the transferred Note on balance of payments grounds pursuant to paragraph 11(e) of the NAB Decision only if the transferee is a member, or the institution of a member, whose balance of payment and reserve position, at the time of the transfer, is considered sufficiently strong for its currency to be usable in transfers under the Fund’s financial transactions plan, or, in the case of the HKMA, the balance of payments position of Hong Kong at the time of the transfer is, in the opinion of the Fund, sufficiently strong to justify such a right; (ii) if the transferee is a non‑participant, references in paragraph 11 of the NAB Decision to the participant’s currency shall be deemed to refer (A) if the transferee is a member, to the transferee’s currency, (B)  if the transferee is an institution of a member, to the currency of that member, and (C) in other cases, to a freely usable currency as determined by the Fund; and (iii) Notes transferred in accordance with this paragraph 6 shall be considered drawn balances of the first transferor participant for purposes of determining the available commitment under its credit arrangement, and Notes obtained by a transferee participant shall not be considered drawn balances of such participant for purposes of determining the available commitment under its credit arrangement.

(d)        The price for the Note transferred shall be as agreed between the transferee and the transferor.

(e)        The transferor of a Note shall inform the Fund promptly of the Note that is being transferred, the name of the transferee, the amount of the Note that is being transferred, the agreed price for transfer of the Note, and the value date of the transfer.

(f)        The transfer shall be registered by the Fund and the transferee shall become the holder of the Note only if such transfer is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the NAB Decision and these General Terms and Conditions. Subject to the foregoing, upon registration, the transfer shall be effective as of the value date agreed between the transferee and the transferor.

(g)        The transferee of a Note may request at the time of transfer that the Note be exchanged by the Fund for a loan claim pursuant to paragraph 13(k) of the NAB Decision to be held by the transferee on the same substantive terms as the transferred Note.

(h)        Notice to or by a transferee that is a non‑participant shall be in writing or by rapid means of communication and shall be given to or by the fiscal agency designated by the transferee in accordance with Article V, Section 1 of the Articles and Rule G‑1 of the Rules and Regulations of the Fund if the transferee is a member, or to or by the transferee itself if the transferee is not a member.
