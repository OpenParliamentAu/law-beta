Division 2—Misrepresentations
23  Ambiguous questions
		Where:
	(a)	a statement is made in answer to a question asked in relation to a proposed contract of insurance or the provision of insurance cover in respect of a person who is seeking to become a member of a superannuation or retirement scheme; and
	(b)	a reasonable person in the circumstances would have understood the question to have the meaning that the person answering the question apparently understood it to have;
that meaning shall, in relation to the person who made the statement, be deemed to be the meaning of the question.
24  Warranties of existing facts to be representations
		A statement made in or in connection with a contract of insurance, being a statement made by or attributable to the insured, with respect to the existence of a state of affairs does not have effect as a warranty but has effect as though it were a statement made to the insurer by the insured during the negotiations for the contract but before it was entered into.
25  Misrepresentation by life insured
		Where, during the negotiations for a contract of life insurance but before it was entered into, a misrepresentation was made to the insurer by a person who, under the contract, became the life insured or one of the life insureds, this Act has effect as though the misrepresentation had been so made by the insured.
26  Certain statements not misrepresentations
	(1)	Where a statement that was made by a person in connection with a proposed contract of insurance was in fact untrue but was made on the basis of a belief that the person held, being a belief that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have held, the statement shall not be taken to be a misrepresentation.
	(2)	A statement that was made by a person in connection with a proposed contract of insurance shall not be taken to be a misrepresentation unless the person who made the statement knew, or a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to have known, that the statement would have been relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms.
	(3)	This section extends to the provision of insurance cover in respect of:
	(a)	a person who is seeking to become a member of a superannuation or retirement scheme; or
	(b)	a person who is a holder, or is applying to become a holder, of an RSA.
27  Failure to answer questions

Division 3—Remedies for non‑disclosure and misrepresentation
28  General insurance
	(1)	This section applies where the person who became the insured under a contract of general insurance upon the contract being entered into:
	(a)	failed to comply with the duty of disclosure; or
	(b)	made a misrepresentation to the insurer before the contract was entered into;
but does not apply where the insurer would have entered into the contract, for the same premium and on the same terms and conditions, even if the insured had not failed to comply with the duty of disclosure or had not made the misrepresentation before the contract was entered into.
	(2)	If the failure was fraudulent or the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, the insurer may avoid the contract.
	(3)	If the insurer is not entitled to avoid the contract or, being entitled to avoid the contract (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) has not done so, the liability of the insurer in respect of a claim is reduced to the amount that would place the insurer in a position in which the insurer would have been if the failure had not occurred or the misrepresentation had not been made.
29  Life insurance
	(1)	This section applies where the person who became the insured under a contract of life insurance upon the contract being entered into:
	(a)	failed to comply with the duty of disclosure; or
	(b)	made a misrepresentation to the insurer before the contract was entered into;
but does not apply where:
	(c)	the insurer would have entered into the contract even if the insured had not failed to comply with the duty of disclosure or had not made the misrepresentation before the contract was entered into; or
	(d)	the failure or misrepresentation was in respect of the date of birth of one or more of the life insureds.
	(2)	If the failure was fraudulent or the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, the insurer may avoid the contract.
	(3)	If the insurer would not have been prepared to enter into a contract of life insurance with the insured on any terms if the duty of disclosure had been complied with or the misrepresentation had not been made, the insurer may, within 3 years after the contract was entered into, avoid the contract.
	(4)	If the insurer has not avoided the contract, whether under subsection (2) or (3) or otherwise, the insurer may, by notice in writing given to the insured before the expiration of 3 years after the contract was entered into, vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) a sum that is not less than the sum ascertained in accordance with the formula

where:
S is the number of dollars that is equal to the sum insured (including any bonuses).
P is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium that has, or to the sum of the premiums that have, become payable under the contract; and
Q is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium, or to the sum of the premiums, that the insurer would have been likely to have charged if the duty of disclosure had been complied with or the misrepresentation had not been made.
	(5)	In the application of subsection (4) in relation to a contract that provides for periodic payments, the sum insured means each such payment (including any bonuses).
	(6)	A variation of a contract under subsection (4) has effect from the time when the contract was entered into.
30  Misstatements of age
	(1)	In this section, the standard formula, in relation to a contract of life insurance means the formula

where:
S is the number of dollars that is equal to the sum insured (including any bonuses).
P is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium that has, or to the sum of the premiums that have, become payable under the contract; and
Q is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium, or to the sum of the premiums, that would have become payable under the contract if it or they had been ascertained on the basis of the correct date of birth or dates of birth.
	(2)	If the date of birth of one or more of the life insureds under a contract of life insurance was not correctly stated to the insurer at the time when the contract was entered into:
	(a)	where the sum insured (including any bonuses) exceeds the amount in dollars ascertained in accordance with the standard formula—the insurer may at any time vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) an amount that is not less than the amount in dollars so ascertained; and
	(b)	where the sum insured (including any bonuses) is less than the amount so ascertained, the insurer shall either:
	(i)	reduce, as from the date on which the contract was entered into, the premium payable to the amount that would have been payable if the contract had been based on the correct date of birth or correct dates of birth and repay the amount of overpayments of premium (less any amount that has been paid as the cash value of bonuses in excess of the cash value that would have been paid if the contract had been based on the correct date of birth or correct dates of birth) together with interest on that amount at the prescribed rate computed from the date on which the contract was entered into; or
	(ii)	vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) the amount in dollars so ascertained.
	(3)	In the application of subsection (2) in relation to a contract that provides for periodic payments, the sum insured means each such payment (including any bonuses).
	(4)	A variation of a contract under subsection (2) has effect from the time when the contract was entered into.
31  Court may disregard avoidance in certain circumstances
	(1)	In any proceedings by the insured in respect of a contract of insurance that has been avoided on the ground of fraudulent failure to comply with the duty of disclosure or fraudulent misrepresentation, the court may, if it would be harsh and unfair not to do so, but subject to this section, disregard the avoidance and, if it does so, shall allow the insured to recover the whole, or such part as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances, of the amount that would have been payable if the contract had not been avoided.
	(2)	The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised only where the court is of the opinion that, in respect of the loss that is the subject of the proceedings before the court, the insurer has not been prejudiced by the failure or misrepresentation or, if the insurer has been so prejudiced, the prejudice is minimal or insignificant.
	(3)	In exercising the power conferred by subsection (1), the court:
	(a)	shall have regard to the need to deter fraudulent conduct in relation to insurance; and
	(b)	shall weigh the extent of the culpability of the insured in the fraudulent conduct against the magnitude of the loss that would be suffered by the insured if the avoidance were not disregarded;
but may also have regard to any other relevant matter.
	(4)	The power conferred by subsection (1) applies only in relation to the loss that is the subject of the proceedings before the court, and any disregard by the court of the avoidance does not otherwise operate to reinstate the contract.
32  Non‑disclosure or misrepresentation by member of scheme
		This Division extends to the case where there was a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, or a misrepresentation was made, to the insurer under a blanket superannuation contract in respect of a proposed member of the relevant superannuation or retirement scheme as though:
	(a)	the insurance cover provided by that contract in respect of that member were provided by an individual superannuation contract between the insurer as insurer and the trustee for the purposes of the scheme as the insured; and
	(b)	that contract had been entered into at the time when the proposed member became a member of the scheme.
32A  Non‑disclosure or misrepresentation by holder of RSA
		This Division extends to the case where there was a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, or a misrepresentation was made, to the insurer in relation to a holder, or a person applying to become a holder, of an RSA as though:
	(a)	the insurance cover provided in relation to that RSA in respect of that person were provided by a contract between the insurer as insurer and the RSA provider as the insured; and
	(b)	that contract has been entered into at the time when the holder became the holder, or the person applying to become the holder, became the holder.
33  No other remedies
		The provisions of this Division are exclusive of any right that the insurer has otherwise than under this Act in respect of a failure by the insured to disclose a matter to the insurer before the contract was entered into and in respect of a misrepresentation or incorrect statement.

	(b)	the event the happening of which gave rise to the claim is a prescribed event in relation to the contract;
the insurer may not refuse to pay an amount equal to the minimum amount in relation to the claim by reason only that the effect of the contract, but for this subsection, would be that the event the happening of which gave rise to the claim was an event in respect of which:
	(c)	the amount of the insurance cover provided by the contract was less than the minimum amount; or
	(d)	insurance cover was not provided by the contract.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not have effect where the insurer proves that, before the contract was entered into, the insurer clearly informed the insured in writing (whether by providing the insured with a document containing the provisions, or the relevant provisions, of the proposed contract or otherwise) or the insured knew, or a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to have known:
	(a)	where the effect of the contract, but for subsection (1), would be that the liability of the insurer in respect of a claim arising upon the happening of the event would be less than the minimum amount—what the extent of the insurer’s liability under the contract in respect of such a claim would be; or
	(b)	where the effect of the contract, but for subsection (1), would be that the insurer would be under no liability in respect of such a claim—that the contract would not provide insurance cover in respect of the happening of that event.
	(3)	Regulations made for the purposes of this section take effect at the expiration of 60 days after the day on which they are notified in the Gazette.
	(4)	Where regulations made for the purposes of this section are amended after the day on which a particular contract of insurance is entered into, the amendments shall be disregarded in relation to the application of subsection (1) to that contract.
36  Interpretation of regulations

37  Notification of unusual terms
		An insurer may not rely on a provision included in a contract of insurance (not being a prescribed contract) of a kind that is not usually included in contracts of insurance that provide similar insurance cover unless, before the contract was entered into the insurer clearly informed the insured in writing of the effect of the provision (whether by providing the insured with a document containing the provisions, or the relevant provisions, of the proposed contract or otherwise).

	(a)	at least one instalment of the premium has remained unpaid for a period of at least 14 days; and
	(b)	before the contract was entered into, the insurer clearly informed the insured, in writing, of the effect of the provision.
40  Certain contracts of liability insurance
	(1)	This section applies in relation to a contract of liability insurance the effect of which is that the insurer’s liability is excluded or limited by reason that notice of a claim against the insured in respect of a loss suffered by some other person is not given to the insurer before the expiration of the period of the insurance cover provided by the contract.

42  Maximum cover for premium
		The maximum liability of the insurer under a contract of general insurance is the highest amount of insurance cover that the insurer would, at the time when the contract was entered into, have been prepared to provide under a contract that was, apart from the maximum liability under that contract, in the same terms and in respect of the same subject‑matter and risk as those of the first‑mentioned contract.

	(3)	Where:
	(a)	the sum insured in respect of property that is the subject‑matter of such a contract is less than 80% of the value of the property; and
	(b)	but for this subsection, an average provision included in the contract would have the effect of reducing the liability of the insurer in respect of loss of or damage to the property to an amount that is less than the amount ascertained in accordance with the formula

		where:
A is the number of dollars equal to the amount of the loss or damage.
S is the amount of the sum insured under the contract in respect of the property; and
P is 80% of the number of dollars equal to the value of the property.

	(2)	Where, at the time when the contract was entered into, the insured was not aware of, and a reasonable person in the circumstances could not be expected to have been aware of, the defect or imperfection, the insurer may not rely on a provision included in the contract that has the effect of limiting or excluding the insurer’s liability under the contract by reference to the condition, at a time before the contract was entered into, of the thing.

	(2)	A payment under subsection (1) is a discharge, to the extent of the payment, in respect of:
	(a)	the insurer’s liability under the contract; and
	(b)	the liability of the insured or of the insured’s legal personal representative to the third party.
	(3)	This section does not affect any right that the third party has in respect of the insured’s liability, being a right under some other law of the Commonwealth or under a law of a State or Territory.
52  “Contracting out” prohibited
	(1)	Where a provision of a contract of insurance (including a provision that is not set out in the contract but is incorporated in the contract by another provision of the contract) purports to exclude, restrict or modify, or would, but for this subsection, have the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying, to the prejudice of a person other than the insurer, the operation of this Act, the provision is void.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to or in relation to a provision the inclusion of which in the contract is expressly authorized by this Act.
53  Variation of contracts of insurance
		Where a provision included in a contract of insurance (other than a contract of insurance that is included in a class of contracts declared by the regulations to be a class of contracts in relation to which this section does not apply) authorizes or permits the insurer to vary, to the prejudice of a person other than the insurer, the contract, the provision is void.

Division 3—Remedies
54  Insurer may not refuse to pay claims in certain circumstances
	(1)	Subject to this section, where the effect of a contract of insurance would, but for this section, be that the insurer may refuse to pay a claim, either in whole or in part, by reason of some act of the insured or of some other person, being an act that occurred after the contract was entered into but not being an act in respect of which subsection (2) applies, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of that act but the insurer’s liability in respect of the claim is reduced by the amount that fairly represents the extent to which the insurer’s interests were prejudiced as a result of that act.
	(2)	Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, where the act could reasonably be regarded as being capable of causing or contributing to a loss in respect of which insurance cover is provided by the contract, the insurer may refuse to pay the claim.
	(3)	Where the insured proves that no part of the loss that gave rise to the claim was caused by the act, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of the act.
	(4)	Where the insured proves that some part of the loss that gave rise to the claim was not caused by the act, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim, so far as it concerns that part of the loss, by reason only of the act.
	(5)	Where:
	(a)	the act was necessary to protect the safety of a person or to preserve property; or
	(b)	it was not reasonably possible for the insured or other person not to do the act;
the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of the act.
	(6)	A reference in this section to an act includes a reference to:
	(a)	an omission; and
	(b)	an act or omission that has the effect of altering the state or condition of the subject‑matter of the contract or of allowing the state or condition of that subject‑matter to alter.
55  No other remedies
		The provisions of this Division with respect to an act or omission are exclusive of any right that the insurer has otherwise than under this Act in respect of the act or omission.
55A  Representative actions by the ASIC
	(1)	If:
	(a)	an insured has entered into a contract of insurance with an insurer; and
	(b)	ASIC is satisfied that the insured has suffered damage, or is likely to suffer damage, because the terms of the contract, or the conduct of the insurer, breaches the requirements of this Act;
ASIC may, by application, if ASIC is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so:
	(c)	bring an action against the insurer on behalf of the insured under or in respect of that contract; or
	(d)	take over and continue, on behalf of the insured, an action brought against the insurer by the insured under or in respect of that contract.
	(2)	If:
	(a)	a number of insureds have entered into contracts of insurance with an insurer; and
	(b)	ASIC is satisfied that those insureds have suffered damage, or are likely to suffer damage, because the terms of the contracts, or the conduct of the insurer, breaches the requirements of this Act;
ASIC may, by application, if ASIC is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so, bring a single action against the insurer on behalf of all of those insureds under or in respect of the contracts so entered into.
	(3)	ASIC may only bring or take over an action under subsection (1), or bring an action under subsection (2), if ASIC has obtained the written consent of the insured or of each of the insureds on whose behalf the action is being brought or is being continued.

Part VI—Claims
  
56  Fraudulent claims
	(1)	Where a claim under a contract of insurance, or a claim made under this Act against an insurer by a person who is not the insured under a contract of insurance, is made fraudulently, the insurer may not avoid the contract but may refuse payment of the claim.
	(2)	In any proceedings in relation to such a claim, the court may, if only a minimal or insignificant part of the claim is made fraudulently and non‑payment of the remainder of the claim would be harsh and unfair, order the insurer to pay, in relation to the claim, such amount (if any) as is just and equitable in the circumstances.
	(3)	In exercising the power conferred by subsection (2), the court shall have regard to the need to deter fraudulent conduct in relation to insurance but may also have regard to any other relevant matter.
57  Interest on claims 
	(1)	Where an insurer is liable to pay to a person an amount under a contract of insurance or under this Act in relation to a contract of insurance, the insurer is also liable to pay interest on the amount to that person in accordance with this section.
	(2)	The period in respect of which interest is payable is the period commencing on the day as from which it was unreasonable for the insurer to have withheld payment of the amount and ending on whichever is the earlier of the following days:
	(a)	the day on which the payment is made;
	(b)	the day on which the payment is sent by post to the person to whom it is payable.
	(3)	The rate at which interest is payable in respect of a day included in the period referred to in subsection (2) is the rate applicable in respect of that day that is prescribed by, or worked out in a manner prescribed by, the regulations.
	(4)	This section applies to the exclusion of any other law that would otherwise apply.

	(2)	Not later than 14 days before the day on which renewable insurance cover provided under a contract of general insurance (in this section called the original contract) expires, the insurer shall give to the insured or a person acting as agent for the insured a notice in writing informing the person to whom the notice is given of the day on which and the time at which the cover will expire and whether the insurer is prepared to negotiate to renew or extend the cover.

	(c)	commences immediately after the insurance cover provided by the original contract expires; and
	(d)	expires, unless the contract is sooner cancelled, at:
	(i)	the expiration of a period equal to the period during which insurance cover was provided by the original contract; or
	(ii)	the time when the insured obtains from the original insurer or some other insurer insurance cover to replace that provided by the original contract;
		whichever is the earlier.
	(4)	Where a contract of insurance is in force by virtue of subsection (3):
	(a)	except in a case to which paragraph (b) applies, no premium is payable in respect of the contract; but
	(b)	if a claim is made under the contract, there is payable by the insured to the insurer, as a premium in respect of the contract, an amount worked out in accordance with subsection (5) or (6), as the case requires.
	(5)	If the claim is for total loss of the property insured, the premium is an amount equal to the amount (the hypothetical premium) that, if the original contract had been renewed for the same period and on the same terms and conditions (including the same subject‑matter and risk), would have been payable by the insured in respect of the renewal.
	(6)	If the claim is not for total loss of the property insured, the premium is an amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

	(a)	a contract of general insurance includes a provision that requires the insured to notify the insurer of a specified act or omission of the insured; or
	(b)	the effect of the contract is to authorize the insurer to refuse to pay a claim, either in whole or in part, by reason of an act or omission of the insured or of some other person;
and, after the contract was entered into, such an act or omission has occurred, the insurer may cancel the contract.
	(3)	A reference in subsection (2) to an act or omission of the insured includes a reference to an act or omission of the insured that has the effect of altering the state or condition of the subject‑matter of the contract or of allowing the state or condition of that subject‑matter to alter.
