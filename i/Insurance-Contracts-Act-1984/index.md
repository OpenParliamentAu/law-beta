## An Act to reform and modernise the law relating to certain contracts of insurance so that a fair balance is struck between the interests of insurers, insureds and other members of the public and so that the provisions included in such contracts, and the practices of insurers in relation to such contracts, operate fairly, and for related purposes

## Part I—Preliminary

##### <a id="1"></a>1  Short title [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act may be cited as the _Insurance Contracts Act 1984_.

##### <a id="2"></a>2  Commencement [_see_ Note 1]

                   This Act shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

##### <a id="3"></a>3  Repeals

             (1)  The Imperial Acts known as The Life Assurance Act, 1774, The Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act, 1774 and The Marine Insurance Act, 1788, in their application to a contract of insurance or proposed contract of insurance to or in relation to which this Act applies, are repealed in so far as they are part of the law of the Commonwealth or of an external Territory to which this Act extends.

             (2)  Section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ extends to those Imperial Acts as so repealed as though they were Acts of the Parliament repealed by this Act.

##### <a id="4"></a>4  Previous contracts

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), this Act does not apply to or in relation to a contract of insurance that was entered into before the date of commencement of this Act.

             (2)  The application of sections 32, 54 and 56 extends to and in relation to a blanket superannuation contract that was entered into before the date of commencement of this Act in so far as a person who becomes, on or after that date, a member of the relevant superannuation or retirement scheme is concerned.

##### <a id="5"></a>5  Crown to be bound

             (1)  This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or of a Territory in which this Act applies or to which this Act extends but does not bind the Crown in right of a State.

             (2)  Nothing in this Act renders the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or of a Territory liable to be prosecuted for an offence arising under this Act.

##### <a id="6"></a>6  Extension to external Territories

             (1)  This Act extends to an external Territory that is for the time being declared by Proclamation to be a Territory to which this Act extends.

             (2)  A reference in this Act to the date of commencement of this Act is, in relation to an external Territory to which this Act extends, a reference to that date or to the date on which this Act commences so to extend, whichever is the later.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Effect of Act on other laws

                   It is the intention of the Parliament that this Act is not, except in so far as this Act, either expressly or by necessary intendment, otherwise provides, to affect the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth, the operation of law of a State or Territory or the operation of any principle or rule of the common law (including the law merchant) or of equity.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Application of Act

             (1)  Subject to section 9, the application of this Act extends to contracts of insurance and proposed contracts of insurance the proper law of which is or would be the law of a State or the law of a Territory in which this Act applies or to which this Act extends.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), where the proper law of a contract or proposed contract would, but for an express provision to the contrary included or to be included in the contract or in some other contract, be the law of a State or of a Territory in which this Act applies or to which this Act extends, then, notwithstanding that provision, the proper law of the contract is the law of that State or Territory.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Exceptions to application of Act

             (1)  Except as otherwise provided by this Act, this Act does not apply to or in relation to contracts and proposed contracts:

                     (a)  of reinsurance; or

##### <a id="13"></a>13  The duty of the utmost good faith

                   A contract of insurance is a contract based on the utmost good faith and there is implied in such a contract a provision requiring each party to it to act towards the other party, in respect of any matter arising under or in relation to it, with the utmost good faith.

                   Where the insured under a contract of general insurance has suffered a pecuniary or economic loss by reason that property the subject-matter of the contract has been damaged or destroyed, the insurer is not relieved of liability under the contract by reason only that, at the time of the loss, the insured did not have an interest at law or in equity in the property.

             (1)  Subject to this Act, an insured has a duty to disclose to the insurer, before the relevant contract of insurance is entered into, every matter that is known to the insured, being a matter that:

                     (a)  the insured knows to be a matter relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms; or

                     (b)  a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know to be a matter so relevant.

             (2)  The duty of disclosure does not require the disclosure of a matter:

                     (a)  that diminishes the risk;

                     (b)  that is of common knowledge;

                     (c)  that the insurer knows or in the ordinary course of the insurer’s business as an insurer ought to know; or

##### <a id="21A"></a>21A  Eligible contracts of insurance—disclosure of specified matters

             (1)  This section applies to an eligible contract of insurance unless it is entered into by way of renewal.

Position of the insurer

             (2)  The insurer is taken to have waived compliance with the duty of disclosure in relation to the contract unless the insurer complies with either subsection (3) or (4).

             (3)  Before the contract is entered into, the insurer requests the insured to answer one or more specific questions that are relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms.

             (4)  Before the contract is entered into, both:

                     (a)  the insurer requests the insured to answer one or more specific questions that are relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms; and

                     (b)  the insurer expressly requests the insured to disclose each exceptional circumstance that:

                              (i)  is known to the insured; and

                             (ii)  the insured knows, or a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know, is a matter relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms; and

                            (iv)  is not a matter covered by subsection 21(2).

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the insurer complies with subsection (3) or (4); and

                     (b)  the insurer asks the insured to disclose to the insurer any other matters that would be covered by the duty of disclosure in relation to the contract;

the insurer is taken to have waived compliance with the duty of disclosure in relation to those matters.

Position of the insured

                     (a)  the insurer complies with subsection (3); and

                     (b)  in answer to each question referred to in subsection (3), the insured discloses each matter that:

                              (i)  is known to the insured; and

                             (ii)  a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to have disclosed in answer to that question;

the insured is taken to have complied with the duty of disclosure in relation to the contract.

             (7)  If:

                     (a)  the insurer complies with subsection (4); and

                     (b)  in answer to each question referred to in paragraph (4)(a), the insured discloses each matter that:

                     (c)  the insured complies with the request referred to in paragraph (4)(b);

Onus of proof—exceptional circumstance

             (8)  In any proceedings relating to this section, the onus of proving that a matter is an exceptional circumstance covered by subparagraph (4)(b)(iii) lies on the insurer.

Definition

             (9)  In this section:

                    <a name="elig-contract-insur"></a>**_eligible contract of insurance_** means a contract of insurance that is specified in the regulations.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Insurer to inform of duty of disclosure 

             (1)  The insurer shall, before a contract of insurance is entered into, clearly inform the insured in writing of the general nature and effect of the duty of disclosure and, if section 21A applies to the contract, also clearly inform the insured in writing of the general nature and effect of section 21A.

             (2)  If the regulations prescribe a form of writing to be used for informing an insured of the matters referred to in subsection (1), the writing to be used may be in accordance with the form so prescribed.

             (3)  An insurer who has not complied with subsection (1) may not exercise a right in respect of a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure unless that failure was fraudulent.

### Division 2—Misrepresentations

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Ambiguous questions

                   Where:

                     (a)  a statement is made in answer to a question asked in relation to a proposed contract of insurance or the provision of insurance cover in respect of a person who is seeking to become a member of a superannuation or retirement scheme; and

                     (b)  a reasonable person in the circumstances would have understood the question to have the meaning that the person answering the question apparently understood it to have;

that meaning shall, in relation to the person who made the statement, be deemed to be the meaning of the question.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Warranties of existing facts to be representations

                   A statement made in or in connection with a contract of insurance, being a statement made by or attributable to the insured, with respect to the existence of a state of affairs does not have effect as a warranty but has effect as though it were a statement made to the insurer by the insured during the negotiations for the contract but before it was entered into.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Misrepresentation by life insured

                   Where, during the negotiations for a contract of life insurance but before it was entered into, a misrepresentation was made to the insurer by a person who, under the contract, became the life insured or one of the life insureds, this Act has effect as though the misrepresentation had been so made by the insured.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Certain statements not misrepresentations

             (1)  Where a statement that was made by a person in connection with a proposed contract of insurance was in fact untrue but was made on the basis of a belief that the person held, being a belief that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have held, the statement shall not be taken to be a misrepresentation.

             (2)  A statement that was made by a person in connection with a proposed contract of insurance shall not be taken to be a misrepresentation unless the person who made the statement knew, or a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to have known, that the statement would have been relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms.

             (3)  This section extends to the provision of insurance cover in respect of:

                     (a)  a person who is seeking to become a member of a superannuation or retirement scheme; or

                     (b)  a person who is a holder, or is applying to become a holder, of an RSA.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Failure to answer questions

                   A person shall not be taken to have made a misrepresentation by reason only that the person failed to answer a question included in a proposal form or gave an obviously incomplete or irrelevant answer to such a question.

### Division 3—Remedies for non-disclosure and misrepresentation

##### <a id="28"></a>28  General insurance

             (1)  This section applies where the person who became the insured under a contract of general insurance upon the contract being entered into:

                     (a)  failed to comply with the duty of disclosure; or

                     (b)  made a misrepresentation to the insurer before the contract was entered into;

but does not apply where the insurer would have entered into the contract, for the same premium and on the same terms and conditions, even if the insured had not failed to comply with the duty of disclosure or had not made the misrepresentation before the contract was entered into.

             (2)  If the failure was fraudulent or the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, the insurer may avoid the contract.

             (3)  If the insurer is not entitled to avoid the contract or, being entitled to avoid the contract (whether under subsection (2) or otherwise) has not done so, the liability of the insurer in respect of a claim is reduced to the amount that would place the insurer in a position in which the insurer would have been if the failure had not occurred or the misrepresentation had not been made.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Life insurance

             (1)  This section applies where the person who became the insured under a contract of life insurance upon the contract being entered into:

                     (a)  failed to comply with the duty of disclosure; or

                     (b)  made a misrepresentation to the insurer before the contract was entered into;

but does not apply where:

                     (c)  the insurer would have entered into the contract even if the insured had not failed to comply with the duty of disclosure or had not made the misrepresentation before the contract was entered into; or

                     (d)  the failure or misrepresentation was in respect of the date of birth of one or more of the life insureds.

             (2)  If the failure was fraudulent or the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, the insurer may avoid the contract.

             (3)  If the insurer would not have been prepared to enter into a contract of life insurance with the insured on any terms if the duty of disclosure had been complied with or the misrepresentation had not been made, the insurer may, within 3 years after the contract was entered into, avoid the contract.

             (4)  If the insurer has not avoided the contract, whether under subsection (2) or (3) or otherwise, the insurer may, by notice in writing given to the insured before the expiration of 3 years after the contract was entered into, vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) a sum that is not less than the sum ascertained in accordance with the formula

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00217/Html/InsContracts1984WD2002_image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name=""></a>**_S_**is the number of dollars that is equal to the sum insured (including any bonuses).

                    <a name=""></a>**_P_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium that has, or to the sum of the premiums that have, become payable under the contract; and

                    <a name=""></a>**_Q_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium, or to the sum of the premiums, that the insurer would have been likely to have charged if the duty of disclosure had been complied with or the misrepresentation had not been made.

             (5)  In the application of subsection (4) in relation to a contract that provides for periodic payments, **_the sum insured_** means each such payment (including any bonuses).

             (6)  A variation of a contract under subsection (4) has effect from the time when the contract was entered into.

##### <a id="30"></a>30  Misstatements of age

             (1)  In this section, **_the standard formula_**, in relation to a contract of life insurance means the formula

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00217/Html/InsContracts1984WD2002_image002.gif)

where:

                    <a name=""></a>**_S_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the sum insured (including any bonuses).

                    <a name=""></a>**_P_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium that has, or to the sum of the premiums that have, become payable under the contract; and

                    <a name=""></a>**_Q_** is the number of dollars that is equal to the premium, or to the sum of the premiums, that would have become payable under the contract if it or they had been ascertained on the basis of the correct date of birth or dates of birth.

             (2)  If the date of birth of one or more of the life insureds under a contract of life insurance was not correctly stated to the insurer at the time when the contract was entered into:

                     (a)  where the sum insured (including any bonuses) exceeds the amount in dollars ascertained in accordance with the standard formula—the insurer may at any time vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) an amount that is not less than the amount in dollars so ascertained; and

                     (b)  where the sum insured (including any bonuses) is less than the amount so ascertained, the insurer shall either:

                              (i)  reduce, as from the date on which the contract was entered into, the premium payable to the amount that would have been payable if the contract had been based on the correct date of birth or correct dates of birth and repay the amount of overpayments of premium (less any amount that has been paid as the cash value of bonuses in excess of the cash value that would have been paid if the contract had been based on the correct date of birth or correct dates of birth) together with interest on that amount at the prescribed rate computed from the date on which the contract was entered into; or

                             (ii)  vary the contract by substituting for the sum insured (including any bonuses) the amount in dollars so ascertained.

             (3)  In the application of subsection (2) in relation to a contract that provides for periodic payments, **_the sum insured_** means each such payment (including any bonuses).

             (4)  A variation of a contract under subsection (2) has effect from the time when the contract was entered into.

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Court may disregard avoidance in certain circumstances

             (1)  In any proceedings by the insured in respect of a contract of insurance that has been avoided on the ground of fraudulent failure to comply with the duty of disclosure or fraudulent misrepresentation, the court may, if it would be harsh and unfair not to do so, but subject to this section, disregard the avoidance and, if it does so, shall allow the insured to recover the whole, or such part as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances, of the amount that would have been payable if the contract had not been avoided.

             (2)  The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised only where the court is of the opinion that, in respect of the loss that is the subject of the proceedings before the court, the insurer has not been prejudiced by the failure or misrepresentation or, if the insurer has been so prejudiced, the prejudice is minimal or insignificant.

             (3)  In exercising the power conferred by subsection (1), the court:

                     (a)  shall have regard to the need to deter fraudulent conduct in relation to insurance; and

                     (b)  shall weigh the extent of the culpability of the insured in the fraudulent conduct against the magnitude of the loss that would be suffered by the insured if the avoidance were not disregarded;

but may also have regard to any other relevant matter.

             (4)  The power conferred by subsection (1) applies only in relation to the loss that is the subject of the proceedings before the court, and any disregard by the court of the avoidance does not otherwise operate to reinstate the contract.

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Non-disclosure or misrepresentation by member of scheme

                   This Division extends to the case where there was a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, or a misrepresentation was made, to the insurer under a blanket superannuation contract in respect of a proposed member of the relevant superannuation or retirement scheme as though:

                     (a)  the insurance cover provided by that contract in respect of that member were provided by an individual superannuation contract between the insurer as insurer and the trustee for the purposes of the scheme as the insured; and

                     (b)  that contract had been entered into at the time when the proposed member became a member of the scheme.

##### <a id="32A"></a>32A  Non-disclosure or misrepresentation by holder of RSA

                   This Division extends to the case where there was a failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, or a misrepresentation was made, to the insurer in relation to a holder, or a person applying to become a holder, of an RSA as though:

                     (a)  the insurance cover provided in relation to that RSA in respect of that person were provided by a contract between the insurer as insurer and the RSA provider as the insured; and

                     (b)  that contract has been entered into at the time when the holder became the holder, or the person applying to become the holder, became the holder.

##### <a id="33"></a>33  No other remedies

                   The provisions of this Division are exclusive of any right that the insurer has otherwise than under this Act in respect of a failure by the insured to disclose a matter to the insurer before the contract was entered into and in respect of a misrepresentation or incorrect statement.

## Part V—The contract

### Division 1—Standard cover

##### <a id="34"></a>34  Interpretation

                    <a name="minimum-amount"></a>**_minimum amount_**, in relation to a claim, means the amount declared by the regulations to be the minimum amount in relation to a class of claims in which that claim is included.

                    <a name="prescrib-contract"></a>**_prescribed contract_** means a contract of insurance that is included in a class of contracts of insurance declared by the regulations to be a class of contracts in relation to which this Division applies.

                    <a name="prescrib-event"></a>**_prescribed event_**, in relation to a prescribed contract, means an event that is declared by the regulations to be a prescribed event in relation to that contract.

##### <a id="35"></a>35  Notification of certain provisions

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a claim is made under a prescribed contract; and

                     (b)  the event the happening of which gave rise to the claim is a prescribed event in relation to the contract;

the insurer may not refuse to pay an amount equal to the minimum amount in relation to the claim by reason only that the effect of the contract, but for this subsection, would be that the event the happening of which gave rise to the claim was an event in respect of which:

                     (c)  the amount of the insurance cover provided by the contract was less than the minimum amount; or

                     (d)  insurance cover was not provided by the contract.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not have effect where the insurer proves that, before the contract was entered into, the insurer clearly informed the insured in writing (whether by providing the insured with a document containing the provisions, or the relevant provisions, of the proposed contract or otherwise) or the insured knew, or a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to have known:

                     (a)  where the effect of the contract, but for subsection (1), would be that the liability of the insurer in respect of a claim arising upon the happening of the event would be less than the minimum amount—what the extent of the insurer’s liability under the contract in respect of such a claim would be; or

                     (b)  where the effect of the contract, but for subsection (1), would be that the insurer would be under no liability in respect of such a claim—that the contract would not provide insurance cover in respect of the happening of that event.

             (3)  Regulations made for the purposes of this section take effect at the expiration of 60 days after the day on which they are notified in the _Gazette._

             (4)  Where regulations made for the purposes of this section are amended after the day on which a particular contract of insurance is entered into, the amendments shall be disregarded in relation to the application of subsection (1) to that contract.

##### <a id="36"></a>36  Interpretation of regulations

                   If a question arises whether an event is a prescribed event, the relevant provisions of the regulations shall be construed as though they were provisions of a contract put forward by the insurer.

##### <a id="37"></a>37  Notification of unusual terms

                   An insurer may not rely on a provision included in a contract of insurance (not being a prescribed contract) of a kind that is not usually included in contracts of insurance that provide similar insurance cover unless, before the contract was entered into the insurer clearly informed the insured in writing of the effect of the provision (whether by providing the insured with a document containing the provisions, or the relevant provisions, of the proposed contract or otherwise).

### Division 2—General provisions relating to insurance contracts

##### <a id="38"></a>38  Interim contracts of insurance

             (1)  Where, under a provision included in an interim contract of insurance, the liability of the insurer is dependent upon the submission to, or the acceptance by, the insurer of a proposal for a contract of insurance intended to replace the interim contract of insurance, the provision is void.

                     (a)  an insurer has entered into an interim contract of insurance; and

                     (b)  before the insurance cover provided by the contract has expired, the insured has submitted a proposal to the insurer for a contract of insurance intended to replace the interim contract of insurance;

the insurer remains liable in accordance with the interim contract of insurance until the earliest of the following times:

                     (c)  the time when insurance cover commences under another contract of insurance (whether or not it is an interim contract of insurance) between the insured and the insurer or some other insurer, being insurance cover that is intended to replace the insurance cover provided by the interim contract of insurance;

                     (d)  the time when the interim contract of insurance is cancelled;

##### <a id="39"></a>39  Instalment contracts of general insurance

                   Where a provision included in an instalment contract of general insurance has the effect of limiting the liability of the insurer by reference to non-payment of an instalment of the premium, the insurer may not refuse to pay a claim, in whole or in part, by reason only of the operation of that provision unless:

                     (a)  at least one instalment of the premium has remained unpaid for a period of at least 14 days; and

                     (b)  before the contract was entered into, the insurer clearly informed the insured, in writing, of the effect of the provision.

##### <a id="40"></a>40  Certain contracts of liability insurance

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a contract of liability insurance the effect of which is that the insurer’s liability is excluded or limited by reason that notice of a claim against the insured in respect of a loss suffered by some other person is not given to the insurer before the expiration of the period of the insurance cover provided by the contract.

             (2)  The insurer shall, before the contract is entered into:

                     (a)  clearly inform the insured in writing of the effect of subsection (3); and

                     (b)  if the contract does not provide insurance cover in relation to events that occurred before the contract was entered into, clearly inform the insured in writing that the contract does not provide such cover.

                    Penalty:  300 penalty units.

             (3)  Where the insured gave notice in writing to the insurer of facts that might give rise to a claim against the insured as soon as was reasonably practicable after the insured became aware of those facts but before the insurance cover provided by the contract expired, the insurer is not relieved of liability under the contract in respect of the claim, when made, by reason only that it was made after the expiration of the period of the insurance cover provided by the contract.

##### <a id="41"></a>41  Liability insurance: insured may require insurer to elect

             (1)  This section applies where it would constitute a breach of a contract of liability insurance if, without the consent of the insurer, the insured were to:

                     (a)  whether the insurer admits that the contract applies to the claim; and

                     (b)  if the insurer so admits, whether the insurer proposes to conduct, on behalf of the insured, the negotiations and any legal proceedings in respect of the claim made against the insured.

             (3)  Where the insurer does not, within a reasonable time after the notice was given, inform the insured that the insurer admits that the contract of liability insurance applies to the claim and that the insurer proposes to conduct, on behalf of the insured, the negotiations and any legal proceedings in respect of the claim made against the insured, the insurer may not refuse payment of the claim, and the amount payable in respect of the claim is not reduced, by reason only that the insured breached the contract as mentioned in subsection (1).

##### <a id="42"></a>42  Maximum cover for premium

                   The maximum liability of the insurer under a contract of general insurance is the highest amount of insurance cover that the insurer would, at the time when the contract was entered into, have been prepared to provide under a contract that was, apart from the maximum liability under that contract, in the same terms and in respect of the same subject-matter and risk as those of the first-mentioned contract.

the provision is void.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect an agreement to submit a dispute or difference to arbitration if the agreement was made after the dispute or difference arose.

##### <a id="44"></a>44  Average provisions

             (1)  An insurer may not rely on an average provision included in a contract of general insurance unless, before the contract was entered into, the insurer clearly informed the insured in writing of the nature and effect of the provision including whether the provision is based on indemnity or on replacement value of the property that is the subject-matter of the contract.

             (2)  Where the sum insured in respect of property that is the subject-matter of a contract of general insurance that provides insurance cover in respect of loss of or damage to a building used primarily and principally as a residence for the insured, for persons with whom the insured has a family or personal relationship, or for both the insured and such persons, or loss of or damage to the contents of such a building, or both, is not less than 80% of the value of the property, the liability of the insurer in respect of loss of or damage to the property is not reduced by reason only of the operation of an average provision included in the contract.

             (3)  Where:

                     (a)  the sum insured in respect of property that is the subject-matter of such a contract is less than 80% of the value of the property; and

                     (b)  but for this subsection, an average provision included in the contract would have the effect of reducing the liability of the insurer in respect of loss of or damage to the property to an amount that is less than the amount ascertained in accordance with the formula

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2007C00217/Html/InsContracts1984WD2002_image003.gif)

                            where:

                    <a name=""></a>**_A_**is the number of dollars equal to the amount of the loss or damage.

                    <a name=""></a>**_S_**is the amount of the sum insured under the contract in respect of the property; and

                    <a name=""></a>**_P_**is 80% of the number of dollars equal to the value of the property.

the average provision has the effect of reducing the liability of the insurer to the amount so ascertained.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="valu"></a>**_value_**, in relation to property, means:

                     (a)  if the relevant contract provides for indemnifying the insured in respect of loss of or damage to the property¾the indemnity value of the property; or

                     (b)  if the relevant contract provides for reinstatement or replacement of the property¾the reinstatement or replacement value of the property;

at the time when the relevant contract was entered into.

##### <a id="45"></a>45  “Other insurance” provisions

             (1)  Where a provision included in a contract of general insurance has the effect of limiting or excluding the liability of the insurer under the contract by reason that the insured has entered into some other contract of insurance, not being a contract required to be effected by or under a law, including a law of a State or Territory, the provision is void.

             (2)  Where, at the time when the contract was entered into, the insured was not aware of, and a reasonable person in the circumstances could not be expected to have been aware of, the defect or imperfection, the insurer may not rely on a provision included in the contract that has the effect of limiting or excluding the insurer’s liability under the contract by reference to the condition, at a time before the contract was entered into, of the thing.

##### <a id="47"></a>47  Pre-existing sickness or disability

             (1)  This section applies where a claim under a contract of insurance is made in respect of a loss that occurred as a result, in whole or in part, of a sickness or disability to which a person was subject or had at any time been subject.

             (4)  Where 2 or more persons have served notices under this section, the amount ascertained under subsection (3) shall be divided between them in proportion to the values of their interests in the property.

             (5)  Nothing in subsection (3) renders the insurer liable to pay to a person an amount exceeding the amount of the loss suffered by that person.

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  a person (in this section called the **_purchaser_**) agrees to purchase, or to take an assignment of, property and in consequence the purchaser has, or will have, a right to occupy or use a building;

                     (c)  the risk in respect of loss of or damage to the building has passed to the purchaser;

the purchaser shall be deemed to be an insured under the contract of insurance, so far as the contract provides insurance cover in respect of loss of or damage to the building and such of the contents of the building as are being sold or assigned to the purchaser at the same time, during the period commencing on the day on which the risk so passed and ending at whichever of the following times is the earliest:

### Division 3—Remedies

##### <a id="54"></a>54  Insurer may not refuse to pay claims in certain circumstances

             (1)  Subject to this section, where the effect of a contract of insurance would, but for this section, be that the insurer may refuse to pay a claim, either in whole or in part, by reason of some act of the insured or of some other person, being an act that occurred after the contract was entered into but not being an act in respect of which subsection (2) applies, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of that act but the insurer’s liability in respect of the claim is reduced by the amount that fairly represents the extent to which the insurer’s interests were prejudiced as a result of that act.

             (2)  Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, where the act could reasonably be regarded as being capable of causing or contributing to a loss in respect of which insurance cover is provided by the contract, the insurer may refuse to pay the claim.

             (3)  Where the insured proves that no part of the loss that gave rise to the claim was caused by the act, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of the act.

             (4)  Where the insured proves that some part of the loss that gave rise to the claim was not caused by the act, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim, so far as it concerns that part of the loss, by reason only of the act.

                     (a)  the act was necessary to protect the safety of a person or to preserve property; or

                     (b)  it was not reasonably possible for the insured or other person not to do the act;

                     (b)  an act or omission that has the effect of altering the state or condition of the subject-matter of the contract or of allowing the state or condition of that subject-matter to alter.

##### <a id="55"></a>55  No other remedies

                   The provisions of this Division with respect to an act or omission are exclusive of any right that the insurer has otherwise than under this Act in respect of the act or omission.

##### <a id="55A"></a>55A  Representative actions by the ASIC

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an insured has entered into a contract of insurance with an insurer; and

                     (b)  ASIC is satisfied that the insured has suffered damage, or is likely to suffer damage, because the terms of the contract, or the conduct of the insurer, breaches the requirements of this Act;

ASIC may, by application, if ASIC is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so:

                     (c)  bring an action against the insurer on behalf of the insured under or in respect of that contract; or

                     (d)  take over and continue, on behalf of the insured, an action brought against the insurer by the insured under or in respect of that contract.

                     (a)  a number of insureds have entered into contracts of insurance with an insurer; and

                     (b)  ASIC is satisfied that those insureds have suffered damage, or are likely to suffer damage, because the terms of the contracts, or the conduct of the insurer, breaches the requirements of this Act;

ASIC may, by application, if ASIC is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so, bring a single action against the insurer on behalf of all of those insureds under or in respect of the contracts so entered into.

             (3)  ASIC may only bring or take over an action under subsection (1), or bring an action under subsection (2), if ASIC has obtained the written consent of the insured or of each of the insureds on whose behalf the action is being brought or is being continued.

##### <a id="56"></a>56  Fraudulent claims

             (1)  Where a claim under a contract of insurance, or a claim made under this Act against an insurer by a person who is not the insured under a contract of insurance, is made fraudulently, the insurer may not avoid the contract but may refuse payment of the claim.

             (2)  In any proceedings in relation to such a claim, the court may, if only a minimal or insignificant part of the claim is made fraudulently and non-payment of the remainder of the claim would be harsh and unfair, order the insurer to pay, in relation to the claim, such amount (if any) as is just and equitable in the circumstances.

             (3)  In exercising the power conferred by subsection (2), the court shall have regard to the need to deter fraudulent conduct in relation to insurance but may also have regard to any other relevant matter.

##### <a id="57"></a>57  Interest on claims 

             (1)  Where an insurer is liable to pay to a person an amount under a contract of insurance or under this Act in relation to a contract of insurance, the insurer is also liable to pay interest on the amount to that person in accordance with this section.

                     (a)  the day on which the payment is made;

                     (b)  the day on which the payment is sent by post to the person to whom it is payable.

             (3)  The rate at which interest is payable in respect of a day included in the period referred to in subsection (2) is the rate applicable in respect of that day that is prescribed by, or worked out in a manner prescribed by, the regulations.

             (4)  This section applies to the exclusion of any other law that would otherwise apply.

             (5)  In subsection (4):

                    <a name="law"></a>**_law_**means:

                     (a)  a statutory law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

##### <a id="58"></a>58  Insurer to notify of expiration of contracts of general insurance

             (1)  In this section, **_renewable insurance cover_** means insurance cover that:

                     (a)  is provided for a particular period of time; and

                     (b)  is of a kind that it is usual to renew or for the renewal of which it is usual to negotiate.

             (2)  Not later than 14 days before the day on which renewable insurance cover provided under a contract of general insurance (in this section called the **_original contract_**) expires, the insurer shall give to the insured or a person acting as agent for the insured a notice in writing informing the person to whom the notice is given of the day on which and the time at which the cover will expire and whether the insurer is prepared to negotiate to renew or extend the cover.

                     (a)  an insurer has failed to comply with subsection (2); and

                     (b)  before the original contract expired, the insured had not obtained from some other insurer insurance cover to replace that provided by the original contract;

then, by force of this section, there exists between the parties to the original contract a contract of insurance that provides insurance cover as provided by the original contract, except that the cover provided is in respect of the period that:

                     (c)  commences immediately after the insurance cover provided by the original contract expires; and

                     (d)  expires, unless the contract is sooner cancelled, at:

                              (i)  the expiration of a period equal to the period during which insurance cover was provided by the original contract; or

                             (ii)  the time when the insured obtains from the original insurer or some other insurer insurance cover to replace that provided by the original contract;

                            whichever is the earlier.

             (4)  Where a contract of insurance is in force by virtue of subsection (3):

                     (a)  except in a case to which paragraph (b) applies, no premium is payable in respect of the contract; but

                     (b)  if a claim is made under the contract, there is payable by the insured to the insurer, as a premium in respect of the contract, an amount worked out in accordance with subsection (5) or (6), as the case requires.

             (5)  If the claim is for total loss of the property insured, the premium is an amount equal to the amount (the **_hypothetical premium_**) that, if the original contract had been renewed for the same period and on the same terms and conditions (including the same subject-matter and risk), would have been payable by the insured in respect of the renewal.

             (6)  If the claim is not for total loss of the property insured, the premium is an amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

                     (b)  but for this section, the insurer would be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the insured against some other person (in this section called the **_third party_**); and

                     (c)  the insured has not exercised those rights and might reasonably be expected not to exercise those rights by reason of:

                              (i)  a family or other personal relationship between the insured and the third party; or

                     (a)  occurred in the course of or arose out of the third party’s employment by the insured; or

                     (b)  was serious or wilful misconduct.

             (3)  Where the third party is not insured in respect of the third party’s liability to the insured, the insurer does not have the right to be subrogated to the rights of the insured against the third party in respect of the loss.

             (4)  Where the third party is so insured, the insurer may not, in the exercise of the insurer’s rights of subrogation, recover from the third party an amount that exceeds the amount that the third party may recover under his contract of insurance in respect of the loss.

             (5)  An insured need not comply with a condition requiring the insured to assign those rights to the insurer in order to be entitled to payment in respect of the loss and an insurer shall not purport to impose such a condition on the making of such a payment or, before making such a payment, invite the insured so to assign those rights, or suggest that the insured so assign them.

                    Penalty:  300 penalty units.

             (6)  An assignment made in compliance with such a condition or in pursuance of such an invitation or suggestion is void.

##### <a id="66"></a>66  Subrogation to rights against employees

                   Where:

                     (a)  the rights of an insured under a contract of general insurance in respect of a loss are exercisable against a person who is the insured’s employee; and

                     (b)  the conduct of the employee that gave rise to the loss occurred in the course of or arose out of the employment and was not serious or wilful misconduct;

the insurer does not have the right to be subrogated to the rights of the insured against the employee.

##### <a id="67"></a>67  Rights with respect to moneys recovered under subrogation

             (1)  Where an insurer, in exercising a right of subrogation in respect of a loss, recovers an amount, the insured may recover that amount from the insurer.

             (2)  Unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, the insured may not recover under subsection (1):

                     (a)  an amount greater than the amount (if any) by which the amount recovered by the insurer exceeds the amount paid to the insured by the insurer in relation to the loss; or

                     (b)  an amount that, together with the amount paid to the insured under the contract, is greater than the amount of the insured’s loss.

             (3)  The rights of an insured and insurer under the preceding provisions of this section are subject to any agreement made between them after the loss occurred.

             (4)  A reference in this section to an amount recovered by an insurer shall be construed as a reference to the amount so recovered less the administrative and legal costs incurred in connection with the recovery of the amount.

##### <a id="68"></a>68  Contracts affecting rights of subrogation

             (1)  Where a contract of general insurance includes a provision that has the effect of excluding or limiting the insurer’s liability in respect of a loss by reason that the insured is a party to an agreement that excludes or limits a right of the insured to recover damages from a person other than the insurer in respect of the loss, the insurer may not rely on the provision unless the insurer clearly informed the insured in writing, before the contract of insurance was entered into, of the effect of the provision.

             (2)  The duty of disclosure does not require the insured to disclose the existence of a contract that so limits the insured’s rights.

the information may be given using the prescribed form of words.

             (2)  Where, by reason of a provision of this Act:

                     (c)  the information is not so given, but is given in writing at a later time;

the rights of a person other than the insurer in respect of a loss that occurred after the contract was entered into but before the information was given are the same as though the information had not been given.

the insurer shall, if the insured so requests in writing given to the insurer, give to the insured a statement in writing setting out the insurer’s reasons for not accepting the offer, for cancelling the contract, for not renewing the insurance cover or for offering insurance cover on less advantageous terms, as the case may be.

                    Penalty:  300 penalty units.

             (2)  In relation to a contract of general insurance, if the state of health of the insured was the reason, or one of the reasons, that the insurer did not accept the offer, cancelled the contract, did not renew the insurance cover or offered insurance cover on less advantageous terms, as the case may be, the insurer may require the insured to inform the insurer in writing of the name of a legally qualified medical practitioner to whom the statement may be given on behalf of the insured and, where the statement is given to the medical practitioner so nominated, the insurer shall be taken to have complied with subsection (1) in relation to the request.

             (3)  In relation to a contract of life insurance where the insured is not the life insured, subsection (1) does not apply if the state of health of the life insured was the only reason that the insurer did not accept the offer, cancelled the contract, did not renew the insurance cover or offered insurance cover on less advantageous terms, as the case may be.

Note:          A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in subsection (3), see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

Note:          A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to a matter mentioned in subsection (7), see section 13.4 of the _Criminal Code_.

## Part X—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="76"></a>76  Contribution between insurers

             (1)  When 2 or more insurers are liable under separate contracts of general insurance to the same insured in respect of the same loss, the insured is, subject to subsection (2), entitled immediately to recover from any one or more of those insurers such amount as will, or such amounts as will in the aggregate, indemnify the insured fully in respect of the loss.

             (2)  Nothing in subsection (1) entitles an insured:

                     (a)  to recover from an insurer an amount that exceeds the sum insured under the contract between the insured and that insurer; or

                     (b)  to recover an amount that exceeds, or amounts that in the aggregate exceed, the amount of the loss.

             (3)  Nothing in this section prejudices the rights of an insurer or insurers from whom the insured recovers an amount or amounts in accordance with this section to contribution from any other insurer liable in respect of the same loss.

##### <a id="76A"></a>76A  Liability of directors and employees etc.

             (1)  A director of a company, or an employee or agent (whether of a corporation or of an individual), who intentionally or recklessly permits or authorises a contravention of this Act by the company, corporation or individual, as the case may be, is guilty of an offence against this Act and, subject to subsection (2), is punishable by the penalty provided in respect of that contravention.

             (2)  If a director of a company, or an individual who is an employee or agent of a corporation, intentionally or recklessly permits or authorises a contravention by the company or corporation, the reference in subsection (1) to the penalty provided in respect of the contravention is a reference to:

                     (a)  the penalty that would apply to an individual in respect of the contravention; or

                     (b)  if there is no penalty provided for an individual—a penalty not exceeding one-fifth of the penalty applying to the company or corporation in respect of the contravention.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  a company or corporation is the agent of an individual; and

                     (b)  a director of the company, or an employee or agent of the corporation, intentionally or recklessly permits or authorises a contravention of this Act by the company or corporation in its capacity as agent of the individual;

then, despite subsection (1), the offence committed by the company or corporation as agent is punishable by a penalty not exceeding 5 times the penalty applying to the individual.

##### <a id="77"></a>77  Giving notices

             (1)  A notice or other document that is by this Act required or permitted to be given may be given:

                     (a)  to a body corporate—in any way in which documents may be served on the body corporate; and

                     (b)  to a natural person:

                              (i)  personally; or

                             (ii)  by post to that person at the person’s last-known address.

             (2)  If a notice of cancellation of a contract of insurance is given to an insured by post, the notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time at which it would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post unless the insured proves that, through no fault of the insured, the insured did not receive it.

##### <a id="78"></a>78  Regulations

                   The Governor-General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing matters:

                     (a)  required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed;
