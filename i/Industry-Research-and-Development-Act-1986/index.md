Note 2:       The notice could also mention the applicant’s right to have the finding reviewed under Division 5 (see section 30B).

             (3)  The Board must notify the R&amp;D entity in writing of any decision under paragraph 27F(4)(b) refusing to make a finding under subsection 27J(1) in response to an application under section 27G by the R&amp;D entity.

             (4)  A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of a finding or decision.

##### <a id="27L"></a>27L  Automatic variations so registration is consistent with findings

             (1)  If an R&amp;D entity is registered under section 27A for an income year, then while a finding is in force:

                     (a)  under subsection 27B(1) in relation to the application for the registration; or

                     (b)  under subsection 27J(1) in relation to the registration;

the registration is taken always to have existed in a form consistent with the finding.

Note 1:       This subsection will cease to apply if the finding is set aside on review (see Division 5).

Note 2:       A finding has no effect to the extent of any inconsistency with a finding already in force under this Part in relation to the R&amp;D entity (see section 32B).

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a finding under subsection 28A(1) (advance findings about the nature of activities) comes into force for an R&amp;D entity about an activity conducted during an income year; and

                     (b)  the R&amp;D entity is later registered under section 27A for the activity for the income year;

then, after registration and while the finding is in force, the registration is taken to exist in a form consistent with the finding.

Note 1:       This subsection will cease to apply if the finding is set aside on review (see Division 5).

Note 2:       A finding has no effect to the extent of any inconsistency with a finding already in force under this Part in relation to the R&amp;D entity (see section 32B).

             (3)  This section has effect for the purposes of this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="27M"></a>27M  Varying registrations on application

             (1)  The Board may, by notice in writing given to an R&amp;D entity, vary the entity’s registration under section 27A for an income year if:

                     (a)  the entity applies for the variation; and

                     (b)  the variation is consistent with the Board’s findings (if any) in force under this Part in relation to the R&amp;D entity; and

                     (c)  making the variation is justified in accordance with the decision‑making principles.

Note 1:       A decision not to vary is reviewable (see Division 5).

Note 2:       Section 32A deals with the decision‑making principles.

             (2)  An application for a variation must be:

                     (a)  in the approved form; and

                     (b)  accompanied by the fee (if any) specified in regulations made under section 48A for the purposes of this section.

Note:          Section 32 deals with approved forms.

             (3)  Section 27E applies to an application under this section in a way corresponding to the way that section applies to an application under section 27D.

Note:          This means the Board may request further information about the application for variation.

             (4)  For the purposes of this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the effect of a variation is that the entity’s registration under section 27A for the income year is taken always to have existed as varied.

##### <a id="27N"></a>27N  Revoking registrations

             (1)  The Board may, by notice in writing given to an entity, revoke the entity’s registration under section 27A for an income year if the Board is satisfied that the entity was not an R&amp;D entity at any time when an activity covered by the registration was conducted during the income year.

Note:          A decision to revoke under this subsection is reviewable (see Division 5).

             (2)  The Board may, by notice in writing given to an R&amp;D entity, revoke the entity’s registration under section 27A for an income year if the entity requests the Board to do so.

##### <a id="28D"></a>28D  Conditions for a finding that an overseas activity cannot be conducted in Australia etc.

Must be an R&amp;D activity

             (1)  The first condition is that the overseas activity is covered by a finding under paragraph 28A(1)(a) or (b) (findings that activities are R&amp;D activities).

Must have significant scientific link to Australian core activities

             (2)  The second condition is that the overseas activity has a significant scientific link to one or more core R&amp;D activities (the **_Australian core activities_**):

                     (a)  that are conducted or to be conducted solely within Australia or an external Territory; and

                     (b)  that:

                              (i)  are registered under section 27A for the R&amp;D entity for an income year; or

                             (ii)  are reasonably likely to be conducted and be registered under section 27A for the R&amp;D entity for an income year.

             (3)  The overseas activity has a **_significant scientific link_** to the Australian core activities if:

                     (a)  the Australian core activities cannot be completed without the overseas activity being conducted; and

                     (b)  the conditions (if any) specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection are met.

Must be unable to be conducted within Australia etc.

             (4)  The third condition is that the overseas activity cannot be conducted solely in Australia or the external Territories because:

                     (a)  conducting it requires access to a facility, expertise or equipment not available in Australia or the external Territories; or

                     (b)  conducting it in Australia or the external Territories would contravene a law relating to quarantine; or

                     (c)  conducting it requires access to a population (of living things) not available in Australia or the external Territories; or

                     (d)  conducting it requires access to a geographical or geological feature not available in Australia or the external Territories; or

                     (e)  it meets a condition (if any) specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

Expenditure must be less than that incurred on Australian core activities

             (5)  The fourth condition is that the total actual and reasonably anticipated expenditure of any entity in all income years on:

                     (a)  the overseas activity; and

                     (b)  each other activity (if any) conducted wholly or partly outside Australia and the external Territories that has a significant scientific link to the Australian core activities;

is less than the total actual and reasonably anticipated expenditure of any entity in all income years on:

                     (c)  the Australian core activities; and

                     (d)  activities conducted solely within Australia and the external Territories that are supporting R&amp;D activities in relation to the Australian core activities.

#### Subdivision D—Findings about whether technology is core technology

##### <a id="28E"></a>28E  Findings about whether technology is core technology

             (1)  If an R&amp;D entity has acquired, or has acquired the right to use, particular technology wholly or partly for the purposes of one or more R&amp;D activities conducted, or to be conducted, during one or more income years, the Board may:

                     (a)  find that the technology is core technology for the R&amp;D activities; or

                     (b)  find that the technology is not core technology for the R&amp;D activities; or

                     (c)  if justified in accordance with the decision‑making principles—refuse to make a finding about the technology and the R&amp;D activities.

Note 1:       A finding, or a refusal to make a finding, is reviewable (see Division 5).

Note 2:       A finding under paragraph (a) means that a tax offset will not be available for expenditure incurred in acquiring, or in acquiring the right to use, the technology for the R&amp;D activities (see subsection 355‑225(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

Note 3:       Section 32A deals with the decision‑making principles.

             (2)  Particular technology is **_core technology_** for one or more R&amp;D activities if:

                     (a)  a purpose of the R&amp;D activities was or is:

                              (i)  to obtain new knowledge based on that technology; or

                             (ii)  to create new or improved materials, products, devices, processes, techniques or services to be based on that technology; or

                     (b)  the R&amp;D activities were or are an extension, continuation, development or completion of the activities that produced that technology.

             (3)  The Board must make a finding under paragraph (1)(a) or (b) if requested by the Commissioner to make a finding under this section.

             (4)  In addition to subsection (3), the Board:

                     (a)  may make a finding under subsection (1) on its own initiative; and

Note 2:       Section 32A deals with the decision‑making principles.

##### <a id="29D"></a>29D  Board may need to make inquiries about an application

             (1)  The Board may notify the applicant in writing that the Board:

                     (a)  needs to make inquiries in order to determine whether the applicant meets the criteria for registration referred to in subsection 29A(2); and

                     (b)  requires the applicant to pay the Board a specified amount towards the cost of those inquiries.

             (2)  The Board may refuse to consider the application until the applicant pays the Board that amount.

             (3)  An amount specified in a notice under subsection (1) must not exceed the higher of:

                     (a)  $1,000; and

                     (b)  the amount (if any) specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection;

and must not be such as to amount to taxation.

#### Subdivision D—Varying or revoking registrations

##### <a id="29E"></a>29E  Duration of registrations

             (1)  At least 2 months before the end of each financial year, the Board must give each research service provider a notice:

                     (a)  asking the provider if it wishes to continue to be registered under section 29A; and

                     (b)  attaching an approved form to be completed by the provider and returned to the Board if the provider wishes to continue to be registered.

This subsection does not apply to a provider who becomes registered under section 29A in May or June of that financial year.

Note:          Section 32 deals with approved forms.

             (2)  The Board may, by notice in writing given to the provider, revoke the provider’s registration under section 29A if the provider does not return the completed form within:

                     (a)  30 days after the notice under subsection (1) was given; or

                     (b)  a further period allowed by the Board in accordance with the decision‑making principles.

Note 1:       A decision to revoke under this subsection is reviewable (see Division 5).

Note 2:       Section 32A deals with the decision‑making principles.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the revocation takes effect at the end of that financial year.

Note:          This subsection will cease to apply if the revocation is set aside on review (see Division 5).

##### <a id="29F"></a>29F  Varying registrations—on application

             (1)  The Board may, by notice in writing given to a research service provider, vary the provider’s registration under section 29A if:

                     (a)  the provider applies for the variation; and

                     (b)  the Board is satisfied that the provider would still meet the criteria for registration referred to in subsection 29A(2) were the application to be successful.

Note:          A refusal to vary is reviewable (see Division 5).

             (2)  An application for a variation must be:

                     (a)  in the approved form; and

                     (b)  accompanied by the fee (if any) specified in regulations made under section 48A for the purposes of this section.

Note:          Section 32 deals with approved forms.

             (3)  Sections 29C and 29D apply to applications under this section in a way corresponding to the way those sections apply to applications under section 29B.

Note:          This means the Board may request further information about the application for variation, and make inquiries about the application for variation.

##### <a id="29G"></a>29G  Varying registrations—otherwise than on application

             (1)  The Board may, by notice in writing given to a research service provider, vary the provider’s registration under section 29A so that the provider ceases to be registered to provide services in one or more specified research fields.

Note 1:       A decision to vary is reviewable (see Division 5).

Note 2:       This subsection will cease to apply if the variation is set aside on review (see Division 5).

             (2)  The Board may do so if the Board is satisfied that the provider does not meet the criteria for registration referred to in subsection 29A(2) in so far as those criteria relate to those research fields.

##### <a id="29H"></a>29H  Revoking registrations

             (1)  The Board may, by notice in writing given to a research service provider, revoke the provider’s registration under section 29A if the Board is satisfied:

                     (a)  that the provider has ceased to meet the criteria for registration referred to in subsection 29A(2); or

                     (b)  that the provider has breached a condition, referred to in subsection 29A(3), of the registration.

Note 1:       A decision to revoke under this subsection is reviewable (see Division 5).

Note 2:       This subsection will cease to apply if the revocation is set aside on review (see Division 5).

Note 3:       Revocation can also happen under subsection 29E(2) if the provider does not appropriately indicate that it wishes to continue to be registered for the next financial year.

             (2)  The Board may, by notice in writing given to a research service provider, revoke the provider’s registration under section 29A if the provider requests the Board to do so.

             (3)  A request for a revocation under subsection (2) must be in the approved form.

Note:          Section 32 deals with approved forms.

#### Subdivision E—Register of research service providers

##### <a id="29J"></a>29J  Register of research service providers

             (1)  The Board is to make available for inspection on the internet a register that includes details of:

                     (a)  registrations in force under this Division; and

                     (b)  registrations that have been revoked under this Division during the current financial year or the previous financial year.

Note 1:       A registration in force under this Division includes the research fields for which the provider is registered.

Note 2:       A registration in force under this Division is that registration as varied under section 29F or 29G.

             (2)  The register is not a legislative instrument.

### Division 5—Review

##### <a id="30B"></a>30B  Notice of reviewable decision and internal review rights

             (1)  When making a reviewable decision relating to an entity, the Board must give written notice to the entity of the following things:

                     (a)  the making of the decision;

                     (b)  the reasons for the decision;

                     (c)  the entity’s right to have the decision reviewed under this Division.

             (2)  If written notice of any of these things is given to the entity under another provision of this Part, notice of the thing does not have to be given twice.

Note:          Other provisions of this Part require notice to be given about decisions covered by item 2, 7 or 11 of the table in section 30A.

             (3)  A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the decision.

##### <a id="30C"></a>30C  Applications for internal review of reviewable decisions

Applications by affected entities

             (1)  An application for review of a reviewable decision may be made by or on behalf of any entity whose interests are affected by the reviewable decision.

             (2)  An application under subsection (1) must be in the approved form.

Note:          Section 32 deals with approved forms.

             (3)  An application under subsection (1) for review of a reviewable decision must be made within:

                     (a)  28 days after the entity to which the decision relates is notified of the decision under this Part; or

                     (b)  such further period as the Board allows in accordance with the decision‑making principles.

Note 1:       A refusal to allow a further period is reviewable (see section 30A).

Note 2:       Section 32A deals with the decision‑making principles.

Applications by Commissioner

             (4)  The Commissioner may, at any time, apply to the Board for review of a reviewable decision.

##### <a id="30D"></a>30D  Internal review of reviewable decisions

             (1)  After receiving an application for review of a reviewable decision, the Board must review the decision.

Making internal review decisions

             (2)  After reviewing the reviewable decision, the Board must make a decision (an **_internal review decision_**):

                     (a)  confirming the reviewable decision; or

                     (b)  varying the reviewable decision; or

                     (c)  setting aside the reviewable decision and substituting a new decision.

Note:          An internal review decision is reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (see section 30E). Under the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, notice of the internal review decision must be given to any person whose interests are affected by the decision.

Deemed internal review decisions

             (3)  If the Board does not make a decision under subsection (2) before the end of the period of 90 days after the day on which the Board received the application for review, the Board is taken, at the end of that period, to have made a decision (also an **_internal review decision_**) confirming the reviewable decision.

Note:          Under the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_, notice must be given to any person whose interests are affected by the internal review decision taken to be made under this subsection.

             (4)  However, an internal review decision (the **_deemed decision_**) is taken not to have been made under subsection (3) if:

                     (a)  after the end of the period referred to in that subsection, the Board makes a decision under subsection (2) about the applicable reviewable decision; and

                     (b)  an application has yet to be made under section 30E to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the deemed decision.

Matters relevant to all internal review decisions

             (5)  For the purposes of this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, an internal review decision takes effect on the day on which the reviewable decision took effect.

             (6)  The Board must notify the Commissioner in writing of:

                     (a)  the making of an internal review decision; and

                     (b)  the reasons for that decision.

##### <a id="30E"></a>30E  External review by AAT of internal review decisions

             (1)  Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of an internal review decision of the Board.

             (2)  Subsection 43(6) of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ has effect for the purposes of this Act and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for:

                     (a)  an internal review decision as varied by the Tribunal under section 43 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_; or

                     (b)  a decision made by the Tribunal under that section in substitution for an internal review decision.

Note:          This means that the varied or substituted decision takes effect from the day on which the reviewable decision took effect (see subsection 30D(5)).

             (3)  If an internal review decision is taken to be made under subsection 30D(3), section 29 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if:

                     (a)  paragraph 29(1)(d) of that Act applied to the internal review decision; and

                     (b)  the prescribed time for the purposes of that paragraph were the end of the period of 28 days starting on the day on which the internal review decision is taken to be made.

             (4)  Despite section 35 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_:

                     (a)  hearings of proceedings for review of an internal review decision are to be held in private; and

                     (b)  during the proceedings, the Tribunal may, by order:

                              (i)  give directions as to the persons who may be present during all or part of a hearing of the proceedings; and

                             (ii)  give directions of a kind mentioned in paragraph 35(2)(aa), (b) or (c) of that Act.

### Division 6—Consolidated groups and MEC groups

##### <a id="31"></a>31  Registrations and findings not effective for subsidiary members for group R&amp;D activities

             (1)  An R&amp;D entity’s registration under section 27A for an income year has no effect to the extent that the registration is for an activity conducted during a period that the R&amp;D entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group, of which the head company is an R&amp;D entity.

Example:    If an activity is conducted by the R&amp;D entity during all of an income year, and part way through the income year the R&amp;D entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group:

(a)    the R&amp;D entity can apply to be registered for the activity for the income year, and that registration will be effective in respect of the first part of the income year; and

(b)    the head company of the group can apply to be registered for the activity for the income year in respect of the second part of the income year.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a finding is made under this Part on application by an R&amp;D entity that is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group; and

                     (b)  the head company of the group is also an R&amp;D entity;

the finding has no effect to the extent that the finding is for an activity conducted during a period that the R&amp;D entity is a subsidiary member of the group.

##### <a id="31A"></a>31A  What happens to findings if R&amp;D entity joins a group

             (1)  If a finding (the **_actual finding_**) under this Part:

                     (a)  is in force for an R&amp;D entity immediately before the time (the **_joining time_**) it becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group, of which the head company is an R&amp;D entity; and

                     (b)  is for an activity to be conducted wholly or partly after the joining time;

a corresponding finding (the **_deemed finding_**) in the same terms is taken to come into force at the joining time for the head company and the activity.

             (2)  The deemed finding ceases to be in force if the R&amp;D entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group.

             (3)  The result of any review (see Division 5) of an actual finding is taken to apply in a corresponding way to the deemed finding.

             (4)  Neither section 28F (notice of decision about findings) nor Division 5 (review) applies to the deemed finding.

##### <a id="31B"></a>31B  What happens to findings if R&amp;D entity leaves a group

             (1)  The consequences in subsection (2) apply if a finding (the **_group finding_**) under this Part:

                     (a)  is for an R&amp;D entity that is the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group; and

                     (b)  is in force immediately before the time (the **_leaving time_**) another R&amp;D entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group; and

                     (c)  is for an activity to be conducted by or for the other R&amp;D entity wholly or partly after the leaving time; and

                     (d)  is not a deemed finding.

             (2)  The consequences are as follows:

                     (a)  a corresponding finding (the **_continuing finding_**) in the same terms is taken to come into force at the leaving time for the other R&amp;D entity and the activity;

                     (b)  everything that happened under this Part before the leaving time in relation to the group finding is taken to have happened in relation to the continuing finding;

                     (c)  the group finding ceases to be in force at the leaving time.

### Division 7—Other matters

##### <a id="32"></a>32  Approved forms

             (1)  This section applies if a provision of this Part requires a thing to be in the approved form.

             (2)  To be in the approved form for the provision, the thing must:

                     (a)  be in writing in a form approved by the Board; and

                     (b)  include the information required by the form; and

                     (c)  include any other material (including documents) required by the form.

             (3)  The Board may approve, in writing, a form for the purposes of paragraph (2)(a). When doing so, the Board must ensure the form requires the production of information, or other material (including documents), specified in regulations made for the purposes of this subsection.

Note:          For specification by class, see subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_.

##### <a id="32A"></a>32A  _Decision‑making principles_

                   The Minister may, by legislative instrument, make principles (the **_decision‑making principles_**) that the Board must comply with when deciding the following:

                     (a)  whether to allow a thing to be given under this Part within a further period than that specified in this Part;

                     (b)  whether refusing to make a finding sought under this Part is justified;

                     (c)  whether making a variation sought under section 27M is justified.

##### <a id="32B"></a>32B  General rules about findings under this Part

             (1)  A finding made under this Part in relation to an R&amp;D entity has no effect to the extent of any inconsistency with a finding already in force under this Part in relation to the R&amp;D entity.

Example:    A finding under subsection 27J(1) in relation to an R&amp;D entity’s registration has no effect to the extent of any inconsistency with:

(a)    a finding already in force under that subsection in relation to that registration; or

(b)    a finding already in force under subsection 27B(1) in relation to the application for that registration; or

(c)    a finding already in force under subsection 28A(1) (advance findings about the nature of activities) in relation to the R&amp;D entity.

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 3  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things etc., in relation to past matters

(1)       Even though a provision is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Note:          Examples of things covered by this subitem are as follows:

(a)    an eligible company may object under Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ in an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011 about a notice given under former section 73I of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for an income year commencing before 1 July 2011;

(2)       Even though a provision is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded so far as it relates to a state of affairs:

                     (a)  that exists after the repeal or amendment applies; and

                     (b)  that relates to:

                              (i)  an act done or omitted to be done; or

                             (ii)  a state of affairs existing; or

                            (iii)  a period ending;

(a)    an amount may be included in an eligible company’s assessable income under former subsection 73BF(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011 if the company receives in that income year an amount for the results of research and development activities for which the company had deductions under former section 73BA of that Act in an income year commencing before 1 July 2011;

(b)    an eligible company’s deduction under section 73B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for expenditure incurred during an income year commencing before 1 July 2011 is reduced because of section 73C of that Act if, in an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011, the company receives a recoupment of that expenditure from the Commonwealth.

(3)       To avoid doubt, this item extends to the repeal of subsection 286‑75(3), and paragraph 286‑80(2)(b), in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

## 5  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on a provision that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.
