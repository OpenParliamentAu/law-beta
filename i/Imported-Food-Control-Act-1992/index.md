	(b)	an officer of Customs reasonably believes, on the basis of information supplied by authorised officers in respect of the Food Inspection Scheme and information supplied by the owner in respect of those particular goods, that the goods may be, or may include, examinable food;
an authority to deal with the food under section 71B of that Act by delivering it into home consumption, or into the warehouse specified in the entry, as the case requires, may be expressed, under subsection (6) of that section, to be subject to the condition that a food control certificate in respect of the food is presented to the person having possession of the food.
	(4)	The granting under the Customs Act of a permission referred to in subsection (1) or (2), or the issue under that Act of an authority referred to in subsection (3), is not to be taken to affect any person’s obligations under this Act in any way.

	(1)	An application for a food control certificate must:
	(a)	be made in a manner prescribed by the regulations; and
	(b)	be made by an owner of the food to which the application relates; and
	(c)	be given or communicated to an authorised officer; and
	(d)	contain such information as the regulations provide.
	(2)	The regulations may provide that an entry of goods under section 71A of the Customs Act for home consumption or warehousing that is communicated to Customs by computer is to be taken, to the extent that that entry relates to examinable food, to be an application for a food control certificate for the purposes of subsection (1).
	(3)	If the regulations make provision in accordance with subsection (2) in relation to a computer entry under the Customs Act, the application so made is taken to have been communicated to an authorised officer at the time when it is taken to have been communicated to Customs under the Customs Act.
12  Issue of food control certificate
Subject to subsections 20(13) and 36(8), if an application for a food control certificate is made under section 11, an authorised officer must, as soon as practicable after deciding whether or not the examinable food to which the application relates is required to be inspected, or inspected and analysed, under the Food Inspection Scheme, give the applicant a food control certificate for presentation to the person having possession of the food.
13  Form of food control certificate
	(1)	A food control certificate must be in a form approved, in writing, by the Secretary for the purposes of this section.
	(2)	The Secretary may approve more than one form of food control certificate.
	(3)	Without limiting subsection (1), a food control certificate must:
	(a)	if the examinable food to which the certificate relates is not required to be inspected, or inspected and analysed, under the Food Inspection Scheme—state that the food is not required to be inspected, or inspected and analysed, under the Scheme; or
	(b)	if the food is required to be inspected, or inspected and analysed, under that Scheme:
	(i)	state that the food is required to be so inspected or so inspected and analysed; and
	(ii)	require the food to be dealt with in a specified manner, or as directed by an authorised officer, pending that inspection, or inspection and analysis.
	(4)	If:
	(a)	a food control certificate is issued in respect of food; and
	(b)	the food to which the certificate relates will not, on presentation to the person having possession of the food, cease to be under Customs control;
then:
	(c)	an authorised officer must give a copy of the certificate to an officer of Customs having responsibility under section 71E of the Customs Act for the movement of goods under Customs control; and
	(d)	the officer of Customs must authorise the food to be dealt with as if an application had been made under that section by the owner of the food in the terms of the requirement contained in the certificate. 
	(5)	The fact that particular food is described in a food control certificate as not required to be inspected, or inspected and analysed, under the Food Inspection Scheme does not imply that an authorised officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that the food may be failing food may not inspect, or inspect and analyse, that food under the Scheme.
Note:	Customs control is defined in subsection 3(1).
14  Imported food inspection advice
	(1)	After food that is required to be inspected, or inspected and analysed, has been so inspected, or inspected and analysed, an authorised officer must issue a written advice:
	(a)	to the owner of the food; and
	(b)	if the food is under Customs control—to the person having possession of the food at the time;
stating:
	(c)	whether the whole or a part of the food dealt with in the advice is identified as failing food; and
	(d)	in respect of food that is so identified—how the food is to be dealt with.
	(2)	Without limiting subsection (1), an advice issued under this section may indicate that food identified as failing food:
	(a)	must be destroyed in accordance with the requirements of section 20; or
	(b)	must either be destroyed or re-exported from Australia in accordance with the requirements of that section; or
	(c)	must, if not treated by the owner in accordance with the requirements of that section:
	(i)	be destroyed; or
	(ii)	be destroyed or re-exported from Australia;
		in accordance with the requirements of that section. 
	(3)	Despite subsections (1) and (2), the owner of food identified in an advice under subsection (1) as failing food may, in the circumstances specified in the Food Inspection Scheme, apply, in writing, to an authorised officer for the issue of a further imported food inspection advice in respect of a part of that food.
	(4)	Neither:
	(a)	the fact that food identified as failing food under an imported food inspection advice may be the subject of an application for a further such advice; nor
	(b)	the making of an application for a further such advice in respect of the food;
causes the food to cease to be failing food on the basis of the original advice but, if the original advice indicates that the food must be treated, destroyed or re-exported, the food is not required to be so treated, destroyed or re-exported unless:
	(c)	the circumstances permitting the application for the further advice cease to exist; or
	(d)	an application is made and rejected.
	(5)	If the owner of food identified in an advice as failing food makes an application for the issue of a further imported food inspection advice in respect of a part of the food, the person must, if the food to which the application relates is under Customs control, inform the person having possession of the food that he or she had made that application.
	(6)	If an application is made under subsection (3), an authorised officer must:
	(a)	if he or she is not satisfied that the application is made in accordance with the requirements of the Food Inspection Scheme—reject the application and give notice to the applicant of that rejection and of the reasons for the rejection; and
	(b)	in any other case—consider the application and issue to the applicant a further imported food inspection advice in respect of the food the subject of the application.
	(7)	If, under subsection (6), an authorised officer is required to inform an applicant either of the rejection of an application or to issue to the applicant a further imported food inspection advice in respect of food that is under Customs control, the authorised officer must inform the person having possession of the food of the rejection of the application or of the particulars of the further advice, as the case requires.
	(8)	If a further advice is issued in respect of the food the subject of an application, this Act has effect as if:
	(a)	that further advice were substituted for the initial advice issued in respect of that food under subsection (1); and
	(b)	subsection (3) were not included.
	(9)	A failure by an authorised officer to comply with the requirements of subsection (7) in relation to an application for a further imported food inspection advice does not invalidate the rejection of that application or the issue of that further advice, as the case requires.
15  Holding orders for certain food
	(1)	If:
	(a)	an inspection, or inspection and analysis, of examinable food of a particular kind indicates the food, or a part of the food, to be failing food; or
	(b)	the Secretary is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that food of a particular kind would, on inspection, or inspection and analysis, be so identified;
the Secretary may, by writing, make a holding order:
	(c)	stating that, until the revocation of the order, food of that kind that is imported into Australia after the making of the order must be held in a place to be approved by an authorised officer, until an inspection, or inspection and analysis, required under the Food Inspection Scheme, has been completed; and
	(d)	specifying the circumstances in which the order will be revoked.
	(2)	If the Secretary is satisfied, in respect of a holding order, that the circumstances specified for its revocation have occurred, the Secretary must, by writing, immediately revoke the holding order.
Division 2—The Food Inspection Scheme
16  Food Inspection Scheme
	(1)	The regulations may set out particulars of a food inspection scheme (Scheme) applicable to all food to which this Act applies.
	(2)	Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations setting out particulars of the Scheme may:
	(a)	empower the Minister, subject to section 17, to make orders identifying food of particular kinds as food of a kind that is required to be inspected, or inspected and analysed, under the Scheme and, from time to time, to vary orders so made; and
	(b)	specify the manner and incidence of inspection, or inspection and analysis, attaching to various kinds of food identified by the Minister in orders made under paragraph (a); and
	(c)	specify the manner and incidence of the inspection, or inspection and analysis, of food of a kind that is subject to a holding order; and
	(d)	specify the manner and incidence of the inspection, or inspection and analysis, of particular food, other than food of a kind that is identified by the Minister in an order made under paragraph (a) or that is subject to a holding order, that is imported into Australia; and
	(e)	set out the circumstances in which authorised officers may exercise powers to inspect, or inspect and analyse, particular food that is not:
	(i)	food of a kind that is identified by the Minister in an order under paragraph (a) or that is subject to a holding order; or
	(ii)	food that is required to be inspected in accordance with regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (d); and
	(f)	specify powers of authorised officers to inspect, or inspect and analyse, food required or permitted to be inspected, or inspected and analysed, under this Scheme; and
	(g)	specify circumstances in which food is to be taken to be failing food because of its relationship to food that is found to be failing food; and
	(h)	set out the circumstances in which food, other than food that is the subject of a holding order, is to be held pending the outcome of an inspection, or inspection and analysis; and
	(i)	permit variation in the incidence of inspection, or inspection and analysis, of food if:
	(i)	a recognised foreign government certificate or a recognised quality assurance certificate covering the food is given to an authorised officer; and
	(ii)	the authorised officer has no reason to doubt the authenticity or reliability of the certificate; and
	(j)	set out the circumstances in which, and procedures by which, the reliability of certificates referred to in paragraph (i) will be tested.
	(3)	Without limiting the factors that may affect the incidence of inspection, or inspection and analysis, of food, the regulations may provide for the incidence to differ according to whether the food is supplied by an overseas processing operation that has previously supplied food of that kind and the results of any analysis of food so supplied.
	(4)	If:
	(a)	food is held pending the outcome of an inspection, or inspection and analysis, under the Scheme, whether because the food is subject to a holding order or not; and
	(b)	that food, or a part of that food, is identified in an imported food inspection advice as failing food;
then, without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may:
	(c)	in the circumstances and within the period set out in the regulations, permit the owner of the food to make application for a further imported food inspection advice in respect of part only of the food so identified; and
	(d)	specify the part of the food so identified in respect of which the application may be made.
17  Making, publication and disallowance of orders
	(1)	The Minister must not make or vary an order made under section 16 unless the Minister has first consulted the Australia New Zealand Food Authority concerning the proposed order or variation.
	(2)	Sections 48, 48A, 48B, 49, 49A and 50 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 apply in relation to orders made by the Minister under section 16 as if references to regulations were references to orders and references to an Act were references to regulations.
	(3)	An order is not a Statutory Rule within the meaning of the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903, but subsections 5(3) to (3C) (inclusive) of that Act apply in relation to an order in the same way as they apply in relation to a Statutory Rule.
	(4)	For the purposes of the application of subsection 5(3B) of the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903 in accordance with subsection (3), the reference in the first-mentioned subsection to the Minister specified in that subsection is to be read as a reference to a Minister administering this Act.
18  Foreign government certificates

	(b)	revoke any such approval.
	(2)	If an overseas food processing operation is subject to a current approval under subsection (1), the Secretary may determine, in writing, to the effect that, while the determination remains in force, each certificate issued by the person purportedly in charge of that operation stating that particular food processed in that operation meets applicable standards and does not pose a risk to human health is a recognised quality assurance certificate.
	(3)	The Secretary may revoke a determination under subsection (2) if:
	(a)	the Secretary has reason to doubt the reliability of any statement made in any certificate to which the determination relates; or
	(b)	the approval of the overseas food processing operation concerned is revoked.

	(a)	has been identified in an imported food inspection advice as failing food; and
	(b)	is required, under that advice, to be treated, destroyed or re- exported from Australia.

the person for whom that chargeable service is arranged must pay to the Commonwealth, within a prescribed period, by way of reimbursement for the amount so paid, an amount equal to the amount so paid.
	(5)	The regulations may prescribe circumstances in which the Secretary may, in his or her discretion, on behalf of the Commonwealth, waive fees that would otherwise be payable under this section.
	(6)	If:
	(a)	a person for whom a service is provided pays for the service before or at the time it is rendered; and
	(b)	the service is not so rendered;
the Secretary may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, refund the amount paid in respect of the provision of the service.
	(7)	Under subsection (1), if the inspection of food leads to its analysis (whether by the person who inspected it or another person), the inspection is not taken to have been provided until the results of the analysis are notified to the person for whom the analysis is arranged.
	(8)	If a person for whom a chargeable service is provided in respect of food does not pay the fee payable to the Commonwealth in respect of that service within 28 days after the last day on which that payment was due, the Secretary may direct, in writing:
	(a)	if the relevant documentation has not already been issued in respect of the food—that authorised officers should not issue such documentation in respect of the food; or
	(b)	if the relevant documentation has been issued in respect of the food—that authorised officers should not issue such documentation in respect of any other food imported by that person into Australia;
until:
	(c)	the person has paid the outstanding fees; or
	(d)	the person has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth in accordance with subsection (9).
	(9)	Without limiting the matters that may be entered into under an agreement referred to in paragraph (8)(d), such an agreement may require a person who has failed to pay a fee to do either or both of the following:
	(a)	pay interest at a rate not exceeding 20% per year, calculated on a daily basis, on the amount of the fees from time to time owing to the Commonwealth in respect of the food;
	(b)	give security for the payment of the fees and interest (if any) owing to the Commonwealth in respect of the food.
	(10)	An authorised officer must not deal with the food in contravention of a direction under subsection (8).
	(11)	In this section:
chargeable service, in relation to food to which this Act applies, means:
	(a)	an inspection, or inspection and analysis of the food; or
	(b)	the arrangement by an authorised officer of an analysis of the food to be carried out by another person; or
	(c)	the issue of relevant documentation in respect of the food; or
	(d)	the supervision of the treatment, destruction or re-exportation of the food; or
	(e)	the provision of any other service that is prescribed for the purpose of this definition.
relevant documentation means:
	(a)	if the food is examinable food—a food control certificate; and
	(b)	if the food is required to be inspected, or inspected and analysed—an imported food inspection advice.
37  Certain moneys are a debt due to the Commonwealth

38  Exemption from suit
	(1)	If:
	(a)	an act or thing is done, or not done (whether or not the act or thing is done or omitted to be done negligently), in good faith by a person exercising or purportedly exercising any power or authority conferred by or under this Act; and
	(b)	a person sustains a loss or injury (including loss or injury by way of damage to the person’s business reputation or the goodwill associated with his or her business) because of the act or thing done or not done;
an action does not lie against the Commonwealth or against a person referred to in paragraph (1)(a) for the loss or injury.
	(2)	If an action is instituted against a person responsible for the manufacture, importation, distribution or sale of food to which this Act applies in relation to a loss or injury directly or indirectly sustained because of the purchase or consumption of food of that kind, it is not a defence to that action that the Commonwealth or any other person has, or has not, exercised any powers under this Act in respect of food of that kind.
39  Compensation for destroyed food
	(1)	If food is destroyed in accordance with section 20, the Secretary may approve the payment of compensation in respect of the food if:

	(b)	the Secretary is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that the food was destroyed as a result of a mistake of fact or of law.
	(2)	Compensation approved under this section must:

	(b)	if there are two or more owners of the food at that time—be divided among those owners in accordance with their interests.
	(3)	The compensation payable under this section in respect of food is the amount agreed between the Secretary and the owner or owners of the food as being the market value of the food immediately before its destruction.
	(4)	If the Secretary and the owner or owners of the food at the time of its destruction do not agree on the market value of the food at that time, the market value must be determined by a person agreed on by the Secretary and the owner or owners.
	(5)	If the Secretary approved the payment of compensation under this section in respect of food, the compensation payable in respect of that food is payable by the Commonwealth to the owner or owners and may be recovered by action against the Commonwealth in a court of competent jurisdiction.
	(6)	In this section:
owner, in relation to food that is permitted to be treated or required to be destroyed or re-exported, means a person having a beneficial interest in the food other than a person who has such an interest only because he or she has been given a mortgage or charge, or has a lien over the goods.
