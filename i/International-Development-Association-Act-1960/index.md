  The Association shall be guided in all its decisions by the provisions of this Article.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  II<lf> <lf>                        Membership; Initial Subscriptions<lf> <lf> Section 1\. Membership<lf> <lf>   (a) The original members of the Association shall be those members of the Bank listed in Schedule A hereto which, on or before the date specified in Article<lf> XI, Section 2 (c), accept membership in the Association.<lf> <p>  (b) Membership shall be open to other members of the Bank at such times and in accordance with such terms as the Association may determine.<lf> <p>Section 2\. Initial Subscriptions<lf> <lf>   (a) Upon accepting membership, each member shall subscribe funds in the amount assigned to it. Such subscriptions are herein referred to as initial<lf> subscriptions.<lf> <p>  (b) The initial subscription assigned to each original member shall be in the<lf> amount set forth opposite its name in Schedule A, expressed in terms of United<lf> States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960.<lf> <p>  (c) Ten percent of the initial subscription of each original member shall be<lf> payable in gold or freely convertible currency as follows: fifty percent within<lf> thirty days after the date on which the Association shall begin operations<lf> pursuant to Article XI, Section 4, or on the date on which the original member<lf> becomes a member, whichever shall be later; twelve and one-half percent one year after the beginning of operations of the Association; and twelve and one-half<lf> percent each year thereafter at annual intervals until the ten percent portion<lf> of the initial subscription shall have been paid in full.<lf> <p>  (d) The remaining ninety percent of the initial subscription of each original<lf> member shall be payable in gold or freely convertible currency in the case of<lf> members listed in Part I of Schedule A, and in the currency of the subscribing<lf> member in the case of members listed in Part II of Schedule A. This ninety<lf> percent portion of initial subscriptions of original members shall be payable in five equal annual instalments as follows: the first such instalment within<lf> thirty days after the date on which the Association shall begin operations<lf> pursuant to Article XI, Section 4, or on the date on which the original member<lf> becomes a member, whichever shall be later; the second instalment one year after the beginning of operations of the Association, and succeeding instalments each<lf> year thereafter at annual intervals until the ninety percent portion of the<lf> initial subscription shall have been paid in full.<lf> <p>  (e) The Association shall accept from any member, in place of any part of the<lf> member's currency paid in or payable by the member under the preceding<lf> subsection (d) or under Section 2 of Article IV and not needed by the<lf> Association in its operations, notes or similar obligations issued by the<lf> government of the member or the depository designated by such member, which<lf> shall be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing and payable at their par value on<lf> demand to the account of the Association in the designated depository.<lf> <p>  (f) For the purposes of this Agreement the Association shall regard as<lf>  "freely convertible currency ":<lf> <lf>    (i)  currency of a member which the Association determines, after<lf> consultation with the International Monetary Fund, is adequately convertible<lf> into the currencies of other members for the purposes of the Association's<lf> operations; or<lf> <lf>   (ii)  currency of a member which such member agrees, on terms satisfactory to<lf> the Association, to exchange for the currencies of other members for the<lf> purposes of the Association's operations.<lf> <p>  (g) Except as the Association may otherwise agree, each member listed in Part<lf> I of Schedule A shall maintain, in respect of its currency paid in by it as<lf> freely convertible currency pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, the same convertibility as existed at the time of payment.<lf> <p>  (h) The conditions on which the initial subscriptions of members other than<lf> original members may be made, and the amounts and the terms of payment thereof,<lf> shall be determined by the Association pursuant to Section 1 (b) of this<lf> Article.<lf> <p>Section 3\. Limitation on Liability<lf> <lf>   No member shall be liable, by reason of its membership, for obligations of the Association.<lf> <p>                                  ARTICLE  III<lf> <lf>                              Additions to Resources<lf> <lf> Section 1\. Additional Subscriptions<lf> <lf>   (a) The Association shall at such time as it deems appropriate in the light of the schedule for completion of payments on initial subscriptions of original<lf> members, and at intervals of approximately five years thereafter, review the<lf> adequacy of its resources and, if it deems desirable, shall authorize a general<lf> increase in subscriptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, general or individual<lf> increases in subscriptions may be authorized at any time, provided that an<lf> individual increase shall be considered only at the request of the member<lf> involved. Subscriptions pursuant to this Section are herein referred to as<lf> additional subscriptions.<lf> <p>  (b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) below, when additional<lf> subscriptions are authorized, the amounts authorized for subscription and the<lf> terms and conditions relating thereto shall be as determined by the Association. <p>  (c) When any additional subscription is authorized, each member shall be given an opportunity to subscribe, under such conditions as shall be reasonably<lf> determined by the Association, an amount which will enable it to maintain its<lf> relative voting power, but no member shall be obligated to subscribe.<lf> <p>  (d) All decisions under this Section shall be made by a two-thirds majority of the total voting power.<lf> <p>Section 2\. Supplementary Resources Provided by a Member in the Currency of<lf>                                  Another Member<lf> <lf>   (a) The Association may enter into arrangements, on such terms and conditions<lf> consistent with the provisions of this Agreement as may be agreed upon, to<lf> receive from any member, in addition to the amounts payable by such member on<lf> account of its initial or any additional subscription, supplementary resources<lf> in the currency of another member, provided that the Association shall not enter into any such arrangement unless the Association is satisfied that the member<lf> whose currency is involved agrees to the use of such currency as supplementary<lf> resources and to the terms and conditions governing such use. The arrangements<lf> under which any such resources are received may include provisions regarding the disposition of earnings on the resources and regarding the disposition of the<lf> resources in the event that the member providing them ceases to be a member or<lf> the Association permanently suspends its operations.<lf> <p>  (b) The Association shall deliver to the contributing member a Special<lf> Development Certificate setting forth the amount and currency of the resources<lf> so contributed and the terms and conditions of the arrangement relating to such<lf> resources. A Special Development Certificate shall not carry any voting rights<lf> and shall be transferable only to the Association.<lf> <p>  (c) Nothing in this Section shall preclude the Association from accepting<lf> resources from a member in its own currency on such terms as may be agreed upon. <p>                                  ARTICLE  IV<lf> <lf>                                    Currencies<lf> <lf> Section 1\. Use of Currencies<lf> <lf>   (a) Currency of any member listed in Part II of Schedule A, whether or not<lf> freely convertible, received by the Association pursuant to Article II, Section<lf> 2 (d), in payment of the ninety percent portion payable thereunder in the<lf> currency of such member, and currency of such member derived therefrom as<lf> principal, interest or other charges, may be used by the Association for<lf> administrative expenses incurred by the Association in the territories of such<lf> member and, insofar as consistent with sound monetary policies, in payment for<lf> goods and services produced in the territories of such member and required for<lf> projects financed by the Association and located in such territories; and in<lf> addition when and to the extent justified by the economic and financial<lf> situation of the member concerned as determined by agreement between the member<lf> and the Association, such currency shall be freely convertible or otherwise<lf> usable for projects financed by the Association and located outside the<lf> territories of the member.<lf> <p>  (b) The usability of currencies received by the Association in payment of<lf> subscriptions other than initial subscriptions of original members, and<lf> currencies derived therefrom as principal, interest or other charges, shall be<lf> governed by the terms and conditions on which such subscriptions are authorized. <p>  (c) The usability of currencies received by the Association as supplementary<lf> resources other than subscriptions, and currencies derived therefrom as<lf> principal, interest or other charges, shall be governed by the terms of the<lf> arrangements pursuant to which such currencies are received.<lf> <p>  (d) All other currencies received by the Association may be freely used and<lf> exchanged by the Association and shall not be subject to any restriction by the<lf> member whose currency is used or exchanged; provided that the foregoing shall<lf> not preclude the Association from entering into any arrangements with the member in whose territories any project financed by the Association is located<lf> restricting the use by the Association of such member's currency received as<lf> principal, interest or other charges in connection with such financing.<lf> <p>  (e) The Association shall take appropriate steps to ensure that, over<lf> reasonable intervals of time, the portions of the subscriptions paid under<lf> Article II, Section 2 (d) by members listed in Part I of Schedule A shall be<lf> used by the Association on an approximately pro rata basis, provided, however,<lf> that such portions of such subscriptions as are paid in gold or in a currency<lf> other than that of the subscribing member may be used more rapidly.<lf> <p>Section 2\. Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings<lf> <lf>   (a) Whenever the par value of a member's currency is reduced or the foreign<lf> exchange value of a member's currency has, in the opinion of the Association,<lf> depreciated to a significant extent within that member's territories, the member shall pay to the Association within a reasonable time an additional amount of<lf> its own currency sufficient to maintain the value, as of the time of<lf> subscription, of the amount of the currency of such member paid in to the<lf> Association by the member under Article II, Section 2 (d), and currency<lf> furnished under the provisions of the present paragraph, whether or not such<lf> currency is held in the form of notes accepted pursuant to Article II, Section 2 (e), provided, however, that the foregoing shall apply only so long as and to<lf> the extent that such currency shall not have been initially disbursed or<lf> exchanged for the currency of another member.<lf> <p>  (b) Whenever the par value of a member's currency is increased, or the foreign exchange value of a member's currency has, in the opinion of the Association,<lf> appreciated to a significant extent within that member's territories, the<lf> Association shall return to such member within a reasonable time an amount of<lf> that member's currency equal to the increase in the value of the amount of such<lf> currency to which the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section are<lf> applicable.<lf> <p>  (c) The provisions of the preceding paragraphs may be waived by the<lf> Association when a uniform proportionate change in the par value of the<lf> currencies of all its members is made by the International Monetary Fund.<lf> <p>  (d) Amounts furnished under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section to maintain the value of any currency shall be convertible and usable to the same<lf> extent as such currency.<lf> <p>                                   ARTICLE  V<lf> <lf>                                    Operations<lf> <lf> Section 1\. Use of Resources and Conditions of Financing<lf> <lf>   (a) The Association shall provide financing to further development in the<lf> less-developed areas of the world included within the Association's membership.<lf> <p>  (b) Financing provided by the Association shall be for purposes which in the<lf> opinion of the Association are of high developmental priority in the light of<lf> the needs of the area or areas concerned and, except in special circumstances,<lf> shall be for specific projects.<lf> <p>  (c) The Association shall not provide financing if in its opinion such<lf> financing is available from private sources on terms which are reasonable for<lf> the recipient or could be provided by a loan of the type made by the Bank.<lf> <p>  (d) The Association shall not provide financing except upon the recommendation of a competent committee, made after a careful study of the merits of the<lf> proposal. Each such committee shall be appointed by the Association and shall<lf> include a nominee of the Governor or Governors representing the member or<lf> members in whose territories the project under consideration is located and one<lf> or more members of the technical staff of the Association. The requirement that<lf> the committee include the nominee of a Governor or Governors shall not apply in<lf> the case of financing provided to a public international or regional<lf> organization.<lf> <p>  (e) The Association shall not provide financing for any project if the member<lf> in whose territories the project is located objects to such financing, except<lf> that it shall not be necessary for the Association to assure itself that<lf> individual members do not object in the case of financing provided to a public<lf> international or regional organization.<lf> <p>  (f) The Association shall impose no conditions that the proceeds of its<lf> financing shall be spent in the territories of any particular member or members. The foregoing shall not preclude the Association from complying with any<lf> restrictions on the use of funds imposed in accordance with the provisions of<lf> these Articles, including restrictions attached to supplementary resources<lf> pursuant to agreement between the Association and the contributor.<lf> <p>  (g) The Association shall make arrangements to ensure that the proceeds of any financing are used only for the purposes for which the financing was provided,<lf> with due attention to considerations of economy, efficiency and competitive<lf> international trade and without regard to political or other non-economic<lf> influences or considerations.<lf> <p>  (h) Funds to be provided under any financing operation shall be made available to the recipient only to meet expenses in connection with the project as they<lf> are actually incurred.<lf> <p>Section 2\. Form and Terms of Financing<lf> <lf>   (a) Financing by the Association shall take the form of loans. The Association may, however, provide other financing, either<lf> <lf>    (i)  out of funds subscribed pursuant to Article III, Section 1, and funds<lf> derived therefrom as principal, interest or other charges, if the authorization<lf> for such subscriptions expressly provides for such financing; or<lf> <lf>   (ii)  in special circumstances, out of supplementary resources furnished to<lf> the Association, and funds derived therefrom as principal, interest or other<lf> charges, if the arrangements under which such resources are furnished expressly<lf> authorize such financing.<lf> <p>  (b) Subject to the foregoing paragraph, the Association may provide financing<lf> in such forms and on such terms as it may deem appropriate, having regard to the economic position and prospects of the area or areas concerned and to the nature and requirements of the project.<lf> <p>  (c) The Association may provide financing to a member, the government of a<lf> territory included within the Association's membership, a political subdivision<lf> of any of the foregoing, a public or private entity in the territories of a<lf> member or members, or to a public international or regional organization.<lf> <p>  (d) In the case of a loan to an entity other than a member, the Association<lf> may, in its discretion, require a suitable governmental or other guarantee or<lf> guarantees.<lf> <p>  (e) The Association, in special cases, may make foreign exchange available for local expenditures.<lf> <p>Section 3\. Modifications of Terms of Financing<lf> <lf>   The Association may, when and to the extent it deems appropriate in the light<lf> of all relevant circumstances, including the financial and economic situation<lf> and prospects of the member concerned, and on such conditions as it may<lf> determine, agree to a relaxation or other modification of the terms on which any of its financing shall have been provided.<lf> <p>Section 4\. Cooperation with Other International Organizations and Members<lf>                         Providing Development Assistance<lf> <lf>   The Association shall cooperate with those public international organizations<lf> and members which provide financial and technical assistance to the<lf> less-developed areas of the world.<lf> <p>Section 5\.

As part of such settlement of accounts, the Association and the government may agree on the amounts to be<lf> paid to the government on account of its subscription and on the time and<lf> currencies of payment. The term  "subscription"  when used in relation to any<lf> member government shall for the purposes of this Article be deemed to include<lf> both the initial subscription and any additional subscription of such member<lf> government.<lf> <p>  (c) If no such agreement is reached within six months from the date when the<lf> government ceased to be a member, or such other time as may be agreed upon by<lf> the Association and the government, the following provisions shall apply:<lf> <lf>    (i)  The government shall be relieved of any further liability to the<lf> Association on account of its subscription, except that the government shall pay to the Association forthwith amounts due and unpaid on the date when the<lf> government ceased to be a member and which in the opinion of the Association are needed by it to meet its commitments as of that date under its financing<lf> operations.<lf> <p>  (ii)  The Association shall return to the government funds paid in by the<lf> government on account of its subscription or derived therefrom as principal<lf> repayments and held by the Association on the date when the government ceased to be a member, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Association such<lf> funds will be needed by it to meet its commitments as of that date under its<lf> financing operations.<lf> <p>  (iii)  The Association shall pay over to the government a pro rata share of<lf> all principal repayments received by the Association after the date on which the government ceases to be a member on loans contracted prior thereto, except those made out of supplementary resources provided to the Association under<lf> arrangements specifying special liquidation rights. Such share shall be such<lf> proportion of the total principal amount of such loans as the total amount paid<lf> by the government on account of its subscription and not returned to it pursuant to clause (ii) above shall bear to the total amount paid by all members on<lf> account of their subscriptions which shall have been used or in the opinion of<lf> the Association will be needed by it to meet its commitments under its financing operations as of the date on which the government ceases to be a member. Such<lf> payment by the Association shall be made in instalments when and as such<lf> principal repayments are received by the Association, but not more frequently<lf> than annually. Such instalments shall be paid in the currencies received by the<lf> Association except that the Association may in its discretion make payment in<lf> the currency of the government concerned.<lf> <p>  (iv)  Any amount due to the government on account of its subscription may be<lf> withheld so long as that government, or the government of any territory included within its membership, or any political subdivision or any agency of any of the<lf> foregoing remains liable, as borrower or guarantor, to the Association, and such amount may, at the option of the Association, be applied against any such<lf> liability as it matures.<lf> <p>  (v)  In no event shall the government receive under this paragraph (c) an<lf> amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the lesser of the two following: (a) the<lf> amount paid by the government on account of its subscription, or (b) such<lf> proportion of the net assets of the Association, as shown on the books of the<lf> Association as of the date on which the government ceased to be a member, as the amount of its subscription shall bear to the aggregate amount of the<lf> subscriptions of all members.<lf> <p>  (vi)  All calculations required hereunder shall be made on such basis as shall be reasonably determined by the Association.<lf> <p>  (d)  In no event shall any amount due to a government under this Section be<lf> paid until six months after the date upon which the government ceases to be a<lf> member. If within six months of the date upon which any government ceases to be<lf> a member the Association suspends operations under Section 5 of this Article,<lf> all rights of such government shall be determined by the provisions of such<lf> Section 5 and such government shall be considered a member of the Association<lf> for purposes of such Section 5, except that it shall have no voting rights.<lf> <p>Section 5\. Suspension of Operations and Settlement of Obligations<lf> <lf>   (a) The Association may permanently suspend its operations by vote of a<lf> majority of the Governors exercising a majority of the total voting power.

Until final<lf> settlement of such obligations and distribution of such assets, the Association<lf> shall remain in existence and all mutual rights and obligations of the<lf> Association and its members under this Agreement shall continue unimpaired,<lf> except that no member shall be suspended or shall withdraw and that no<lf> distribution shall be made to members except as in this Section provided.<lf> <p>  (b) No distribution shall be made to members on account of their subscriptions until all liabilities to creditors shall have been discharged or provided for<lf> and until the Board of Governors, by vote of a majority of the Governors<lf> exercising a majority of the total voting power, shall have decided to make such distribution.<lf> <p>  (c) Subject to the foregoing, and to any special arrangements for the<lf> disposition of supplementary resources agreed upon in connection with the<lf> provision of such resources to the Association, the Association shall distribute its assets to members pro rata in proportion to amounts paid in by them on<lf> account of their subscriptions. Any distribution pursuant to the foregoing<lf> provision of this paragraph (c) shall be subject, in the case of any member, to<lf> prior settlement of all outstanding claims by the Association against such<lf> member. Such distribution shall be made at such times, in such currencies, and<lf> in cash or other assets as the Association shall deem fair and equitable.<lf> Distribution to the several members need not be uniform in respect of the type<lf> of assets distributed or of the currencies in which they are expressed.<lf> <p>  (d) Any member receiving assets distributed by the Association pursuant to<lf> this Section or Section 4 shall enjoy the same rights with respect to such<lf> assets as the Association enjoyed prior to their distribution.<lf> <p>                                 ARTICLE  VIII<lf> <lf>                        Status, Immunities and Privileges<lf> <lf> Section 1\.
