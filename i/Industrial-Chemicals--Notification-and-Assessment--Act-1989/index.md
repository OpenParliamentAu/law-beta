             (2)  Every person who applies to be registered must pay a prescribed fee for the application.

             (3)  However, broadly speaking, only those who introduced chemicals of at least the threshold value last financial year, or who propose to introduce chemicals of at least that value during this financial year, must pay a registration charge. (A person who pays the charge at the beginning of the year but who does not in fact introduce chemicals of at least the threshold value during the year is entitled to a refund.)

##### <a id="80B"></a>80B  Person must be registered to introduce relevant industrial chemicals

             (1)  A person commits an offence if:

                     (a)  the person introduces any relevant industrial chemicals in a registration year; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  the person is not registered in relation to the registration year; or

                             (ii)  at the time the relevant chemicals are introduced, the person’s registration in relation to the registration year is not in force.

                    Penalty:  300 penalty units.

                     (b)  when the Director grants the renewal application—since the start of that registration year.

             (6)  However, subsection (5) does not apply for the purposes of a prosecution under section 80B:

                     (a)  that is in relation to the introduction of relevant industrial chemicals that occurred in the registration year for which the late renewal application is made; and

                     (b)  for which the charge was laid before the late renewal application was made.

##### <a id="80KC"></a>80KC  Director must give notice of renewal decision

##### <a id="80M"></a>80M  Time for dealing with applications

                   Subject to section 80N, the Director must deal with an application for registration, or renewal of registration, as follows:

                     (a)  if the application is in relation to the registration year in which the application is made or a previous registration year—as soon as practicable but, in any case, within 30 days after receipt of the application; and

                     (b)  if the application is in relation to the next registration year—as soon as practicable but, in any case, not later than the later of:

                              (i)  30 days after the start of that next registration year; and

                             (ii)  30 days after receipt of the application.

##### <a id="80N"></a>80N  Director may require further information

             (1)  If the Director is satisfied that, for a proper consideration of an application for registration or renewal, further information is required, he or she may, by notice in writing given to the applicant, require the applicant to provide the further information within a period specified in the notice.

             (2)  In working out a period of 30 days referred to in section 80M, the period starting with the giving of that notice and ending with the provision of:

                     (a)  the further information; or

must be disregarded.

             (3)  If the applicant fails either to provide that further information or to explain why that further information cannot be provided within the period allowed for providing that further information, the application is taken to have been withdrawn at the end of that period.

##### <a id="80P"></a>80P  Cancellation or endorsement of registration in certain cases

             (1)  The Director must cancel a person’s registration in relation to a particular registration year if the person’s name was entered on the Register by mistake.

             (2)  The Director may correct the Register if he or she is satisfied that any particulars recorded in relation to a person whose name was entered on the Register were recorded in error.

             (3)  If, at any time during or after the end of a registration year, the Director becomes satisfied for any reason that a person registered in relation to that year will not, or did not, during that year, introduce chemicals of a value equal to or exceeding the threshold value, the Director must:

                     (a)  endorse the Register with a notation stating that he or she is so satisfied and indicating the reason for being so satisfied; and

                     (b)  if the person has paid an amount as or on account of registration charge—notify the person in writing that the person is entitled to be repaid that amount; and

                     (c)  unless the person is a body corporate that has ceased to exist because of a takeover or a merger—pay to the person, on behalf of the Commonwealth, an amount equal to the amount paid as registration charge, or on account of registration charge, payable in relation to the registration year.

             (4)  It is a condition of registration that a person who is registered in relation to a registration year must inform the Director in writing:

                     (a)  as soon as possible; and

                     (b)  in any case, before August 31 of that registration year;

if the person considers that, for any reason, it is unlikely that the person will seek registration in relation to the next registration year.

             (5)  Compliance with the condition set out in subsection (4) in relation to a particular registration year does not prevent a person later seeking registration in relation to that registration year.

##### <a id="80Q"></a>80Q  Certain registered persons to provide final statements concerning introduction

             (1)  A person who, under subparagraph 80F(e)(ii), 80KA(1)(e)(ii) or 80KB(2)(c)(ii), has paid an amount on account of the registration charge payable in relation to a registration year must, within 2 months after the end of that registration year or such longer period as the Director allows, give the Director a written statement in the approved form indicating the value of the relevant industrial chemicals actually introduced by the person in that year.

                     (a)  if registration charge is payable by that person in relation to that year—the amount of charge so payable; and

                     (b)  if registration charge is not payable by that person in relation to that year—a statement to that effect; and

                     (c)  if registration charge is payable by that person but the person is entitled to be repaid the charge under subsection 80P(3)—the amount of the charge so payable and the amount of the repayment.

             (2)  The assessment issued in respect of a person and a registration year must record the amount paid on account of registration charge in relation to that year.

             (3)  If registration charge is payable in relation to a registration year, any amount paid on account of that charge is, by force of this subsection, applied in satisfaction of that charge.

             (4)  If the amount of registration charge payable by a person in relation to a registration year exceeds the amount paid on account of that charge, the person is required to pay an amount of charge equal to the amount of the excess.

             (5)  In the circumstances referred to in subsection (4):

                     (a)  the assessment must set out a date (which may not be earlier than 28 days after the day the assessment is given) by which charge equal to the amount of the excess referred to in that subsection is required to be paid by the person to whom the assessment relates; and

                     (b)  if that amount is not so paid within that period—it may be recovered from that person as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

             (6)  An assessment is taken to be a decision for the purpose of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_.

             (7)  The production of an assessment, or of a document purporting to be an assessment, signed by the Director or a delegate of the Director, is conclusive evidence:

                     (a)  of the due making of the assessment; and

                     (b)  except in proceedings under section 80QC on a review or appeal relating to the assessment—that the amounts specified in the assessment and all the particulars of the assessment are correct.

##### <a id="80QB"></a>80QB  Fresh assessments

             (1)  Subject to subsection (2), if the Director is satisfied that an assessment made under section 80QA is incorrect, the Director may make a fresh assessment under that section in substitution for the original assessment, whether or not registration charge has been fully paid in respect of the original assessment.

             (2)  A fresh assessment may:

                     (a)  if the original assessment was based on false or misleading information given to the Director—be made at any time; or

                     (b)  otherwise—be made only within 4 years from the day on which charge became payable under the original assessment.

##### <a id="80QC"></a>80QC  Reconsideration and review of assessments

             (1)  A person who receives an assessment made by the Director may, by written notice given to the Director within 21 days after the day on which the person first received the assessment or such longer period that the Director allows, request the Director to reconsider the assessment.

             (2)  The person must set out in the request reasons for making the request.

             (3)  Upon receipt of the request, the Director must reconsider the assessment and, subject to subsection (4), may confirm or revoke the assessment or vary the assessment in any manner that he or she thinks fit.

             (4)  If the Director does not confirm, revoke or vary an assessment within 21 days after the day he or she received the request under subsection (1) to reconsider the assessment, he or she is taken, at the end of that period, to have confirmed the assessment under subsection (3).

             (5)  If the Director confirms, revokes or varies an assessment before the end of the period referred to in subsection (4), the Director must, by written notice given to the person making the request, tell the person the result of the reconsideration of the assessment and the reasons for confirming, varying or revoking the assessment, as the case may be.

             (6)  A failure to comply with subsection (5) does not affect the validity of the confirmation, revocation or variation.

             (7)  Applications may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of assessments of the Director that have been confirmed or varied under subsection (3).

             (8)  If an assessment is taken, because of subsection (4), to be confirmed, section 29 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the prescribed time for making application for review of the assessment were the period beginning on the day on which the assessment is taken to be confirmed and ending on the 28th day after that day.

             (9)  If a request is made under subsection (1) in respect of an assessment, section 41 of the _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975_ applies as if the making of the request were the making of an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the assessment.

##### <a id="80QD"></a>80QD  Retention of records by certain registered persons

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a person makes an application for registration, or renewal of registration, in relation to a registration year; and

                     (b)  the Director grants that application;

the person must retain, for 5 years after the end of that registration year, such records relating to the introduction of industrial chemicals in that year (whether introduced before, on or after, the day of grant of the application) as are necessary to work out whether the registration charge is payable and any amount of registration charge payable by the person in relation to that year under paragraph 80T(2)(a) or (b).

                    Penalty:  30 penalty units

             (2)  Subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

Note:          For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### <a id="80R"></a>80R  Transfer of registration

             (1)  Except as set out in subsections (2), (3) and (4), the registration of a person is not transferable.
