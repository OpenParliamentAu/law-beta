Note:          Most of the conventions, protocols and other agreements described in these sections are set out in the Australian Treaty Series.

                    <a name="assess-act"></a>**_Assessment Act_** means the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                    <a name="australian-tax"></a>**_Australian tax_** means:

                     (a)  income tax imposed as such by an Act; or

                     (b)  fringe benefits tax imposed by the _Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986_.

Note:          This includes Medicare levy (see subsection (10)).

                    <a name="foreign-tax"></a>**_foreign tax_** means tax, other than Australian tax, which is the subject of an agreement.

                    <a name="prescrib-trust-estat"></a>**_prescribed trust estate_**, in relation to a year of income, means a trust estate that:

             (2)  For the purpose of this Act and the Assessment Act, a reference in an agreement to profits of an activity or business shall, in relation to Australian tax, be read, where the context so permits, as a reference to taxable income derived from that activity or business.

          (2A)  After the commencement of this subsection, a reference in an agreement to income from shares, or to income from other rights participating in profits, does not include a reference to a return on a debt interest (as defined in Subdivision 974‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

             (3)  For the purposes of this Act, an amount of income derived by a person, being income other than interest or royalties, shall be deemed to be income attributable to interest or royalties, as the case may be:

                     (b)  if the person derived the amount of income as a beneficiary in a trust estate and the amount of income can be attributed, directly or indirectly, to the interest or royalties or to an amount that is to be deemed, by any application or successive applications of this subsection, to be an amount of income attributable to the interest or royalties.

             (4)  Where a beneficiary in a trust estate, other than a trust estate that is a prescribed trust estate, in relation to the year of income, is presently entitled to income of the trust estate, that income shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an amount of income derived by the person.

             (8)  Where, by virtue of a provision of an agreement, the expression **_royalties_** as used in, or in a particular provision of, that agreement has the meaning that that expression has under the law of Australia relating to income tax, that expression has, for the purposes of that agreement or of that particular provision, as the case may be, the meaning that that expression has by virtue of subsection 6(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (9)  Where, by virtue of a provision of an agreement, expressions used in, or in a particular provision of, that agreement and not otherwise defined for the purposes of that agreement or of that particular provision have the meanings that those expressions have under the law of Australia relating to income tax, subsection (8) does not affect the interpretation of that agreement or of that particular provision, as the case may be, in relation to the meaning of expressions other than the expression **_royalties_**.

           (10)  For the purposes of this Act, Medicare levy shall be deemed to be income tax and to be imposed as such and, unless the contrary intention appears, references to income tax or tax shall be construed accordingly.

           (11)  Where:

                     (a)  a beneficiary of a trust estate (not being a prescribed trust estate) who is a resident of a country with which, or with the government of which, Australia, or the Government of Australia, has made an agreement before the commencement of this subsection is presently entitled, either directly or through one or more interposed trust estates, to a share of the income of the trust estate derived from the carrying on by the trustee in Australia of a business through a permanent establishment in Australia; and

                     (b)  under the agreement, the income is to be dealt with in accordance with the article (in this subsection referred to as the **_business profits article_**) of the agreement relating to the taxing of income of an enterprise of a Contracting State where the enterprise carries on a business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State;

for the purpose of determining whether the beneficiary’s share of the income may be taxed in Australia in accordance with the business profits article:

                     (c)  the beneficiary shall be deemed to carry on in Australia, through a permanent establishment in Australia, the business carried on in Australia by the trustee; and

                     (d)  the beneficiary’s share of the income shall be deemed to be attributable to that permanent establishment.

        (11A)  If:

                     (a)  the licensee of a spectrum licence (within the meaning of the _Radiocommunications Act 1992_), or a person authorised under section 68 of that Act by the licensee, derives income from operating radiocommunications devices (within the meaning of that Act) under the licence or from authorising others to do so; and

                     (b)  the licensee or authorised person is a resident of a country (other than Australia), or a territory (other than an Australian‑‑controlled territory), to whose residents an agreement applies; and

                     (c)  under the agreement, the income is to be dealt with in accordance with the business profits article of the agreement referred to in paragraph 3(11)(b);

for the purpose of determining whether the income may be taxed in Australia in accordance with the business profits article:

                     (d)  the licensee or authorised person is taken to carry on a business, through a permanent establishment, in Australia; and

                     (e)  the income is taken to be attributable to that permanent establishment.

           (12)  In subsections (11) and (11A):

                    <a name="contract-state"></a>**_Contracting State_**, in relation to an agreement, means a country which, or the government of which, is a party to the agreement.

             (2)  Where a person is liable to pay an amount of United States tax to which this section applies, there is payable by that person to the Commissioner as a debt due to the Queen on behalf of Australia an amount equivalent to that amount, and the amount so payable may be sued for and recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner suing in his or her official name.

             (3)  An amount payable to the Commissioner under the last preceding subsection may be collected by the Commissioner under section 218 of the Assessment Act and, for that purpose, a reference in that section to a taxpayer shall be read as a reference to the person by whom that amount is payable and a reference to an amount due by a taxpayer in respect of tax shall be read as a reference to the amount so payable.

             (5)  The Commissioner shall pay to the Government of the United States of America an amount equal to any amount paid or recovered by virtue of this section.

Article 7

Business profits

1.         The profits of an enterprise of a territory shall be taxable only in that territory unless the enterprise carries on business in the other territory through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory. If the enterprise carries on business in that manner, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other territory but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

2.         Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a territory carries on business in the other territory through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory, there shall be attributed to that permanent establishment in each territory the profits which that permanent establishment might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

3.         In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the territory in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

4.         No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

5.         Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a territory relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that territory is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article.

6.         Where profits include items of income or gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

7.         Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law of a territory relating to tax imposed on profits from insurance with non‑residents provided that if the relevant law in force in either territory at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the parties to this Agreement shall consult each other with a view to facilitating any amendment of this paragraph as may be appropriate.

8.         Where:

            (a)     a resident of a territory is beneficially entitled, whether directly or through one or more interposed trust estates, to a share of the business profits of an enterprise carried on in the other territory by the trustee of a trust estate other than a trust estate which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and

            (b)     in relation to that enterprise, that trustee would, in accordance with the principles of Article 5, have a permanent establishment in that other territory,

the enterprise carried on by the trustee shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other territory by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory and that share of business profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment.

Article 8

Ships and aircraft

1.         Profits derived by an enterprise of a territory from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that territory.

2.         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, such profits shall be taxed in the other territory to the extent that they are profits derived directly or indirectly from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that other territory.

3.         The profits to which the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 apply shall include profits from:

            (a)     the lease of ships or aircraft on a full time, voyage or bareboat basis, and of containers and related equipment, which is merely incidental to the international operation of ships or aircraft by the lessor, provided that the leased ships or aircraft, or the containers and related equipment, are used in international operations by the lessee; and

            (b)     the operation of ships or aircraft derived through participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.

4.         For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a territory and discharged at a place in that territory shall be treated as profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that territory.

Article 9

Associated enterprises

1.         Where

            (a)     an enterprise of a territory participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other territory; or

            (b)     the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a territory and an enterprise of the other territory,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2.         Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a territory relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that territory is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article.

3.         Where profits on which an enterprise of a territory has been charged to tax in that territory are also included, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 1 or 2, in the profits of an enterprise of the other territory and charged to tax in that other territory, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other territory if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first‑mentioned territory shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first‑mentioned territory. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and for this purpose the competent authorities shall if necessary consult each other.

Article 10

Dividends

1.         Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a territory for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other territory is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other territory.

2.         However, those dividends may also be taxed in the territory of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that territory, but the tax so charged shall not exceed:

            (a)     in the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Australian Taxation Office is applied:

                     (i)      10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, to the extent to which the dividends have been fully “franked” in accordance with the federal law of that territory relating to its income tax; and

                     (ii)     15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases; and

            (b)     in the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Department of Taxation, Ministry of Finance, Taipei is applied:

                     (i)      10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, where the dividends are paid to a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends; and

                     (ii)     15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases,

provided that if the relevant law in either territory at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied, otherwise than in minor respects so as to not affect its general character, the parties to this Agreement shall consult each other with a view to facilitating any amendment of this paragraph as may be appropriate.

3.         The term “dividends” in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the law, relating to tax, of the territory of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax.

4.         The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated in that other territory, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In that case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.         Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a territory, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other territory is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other territory except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other territory. This paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Australian Taxation Office is applied for the purposes of tax imposed by that territory and which is also a resident of the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Department of Taxation, Ministry of Finance, Taipei is applied for the purposes of tax imposed by that territory.

Article 11

Interest

1.         Interest arising in a territory, being interest to which a resident of the other territory is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other territory.

2.         However, that interest may also be taxed in the territory in which it arises, and according to the law of that territory, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

3.         The term “interest” in this Article includes interest from government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, interest from any other form of indebtedness and all other income assimilated to income from money lent by the law, relating to tax, of the territory in which the income arises.

4.         The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated in that other territory, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In that case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.         Interest shall be deemed to arise in a territory when the payer is an authority of that territory or a subdivision or local authority of that territory or a person who is a resident of that territory for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a territory or not, has in a territory a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and that interest is borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then the interest shall be deemed to arise in the territory in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

6.         Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of that relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last‑mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law, relating to tax, of each territory, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

Article 12

Royalties

1.         Royalties arising in a territory, being royalties to which a resident of the other territory is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other territory.

2.         However, those royalties may also be taxed in the territory in which they arise, and according to the law of that territory, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 12.5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3.         The term “royalties” in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for:

            (a)     the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; or

            (b)     the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment; or

            (c)     the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information; or

            (d)     the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (paragraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (paragraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (paragraph (c) of this paragraph; or

            (e)     the reception of, or the right to receive, visual images or sounds, or both, transmitted to the public by:

                     (i)      satellite; or

                     (ii)     cable, optic fibre or similar technology; or

             (f)     the use in connection with television broadcasting or radio broadcasting, or the right to use in connection with television broadcasting or radio broadcasting, visual images or sounds, or both, transmitted by:

                     (i)      satellite; or

                     (ii)     cable, optic fibre or similar technology; or

            (g)     the use of, or the right to use:

                     (i)      motion picture films; or

                     (ii)     films or video tapes for use in connection with television; or

                     (iii)    tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting; or

            (h)     total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph.

4.         The provisions of paragraphs l and 2 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated in that other territory, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated in that other territory, and the property or right in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In that case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.         Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a territory when the payer is an authority of that territory or a subdivision or local authority of that territory or a person who is a resident of that territory for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a territory or not, has in a territory a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the territory in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

6.         Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last‑mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the law, relating to tax, of each territory, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

Article 13

Alienation of property

1.         Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a territory from the alienation of real property situated in the other territory may be taxed in that other territory.

2.         Income, profits or gains from the alienation of property, other than real property, that forms part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a territory has in the other territory or pertains to a fixed base available in that other territory to a resident of the first‑mentioned territory for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including income, profits or gains from the alienation of that permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of that fixed base, may be taxed in that other territory.

3.         Income, profits or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or of property (other than real property) pertaining to the operation of those ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in the territory of which the enterprise operating those ships or aircraft is a resident.

4.         Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a territory from the alienation of shares or comparable interests in a company, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of real property situated in the other territory, may be taxed in that other territory.

5.         Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the application of a law of a territory relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply.

6.         In this Article, the term “real property” has the same meaning as it has in Article 6.

7.         The situation of real property shall be determined for the purposes of this Article in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 6.

Article 14

Independent personal services

1.         Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a territory in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that territory unless a fixed base is regularly available to the individual in the other territory for the purpose of performing the individual's activities. If such a fixed base is available to the individual, the income may be taxed in the other territory but only so much of it as is attributable to activities exercised from that fixed base.

2.         The term “professional services” includes services performed in the exercise of independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as in the exercise of the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants.

Article l5

Dependent personal services

1.         Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and l9, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of a territory in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that territory unless the employment is exercised in the other territory. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived from that exercise may be taxed in that other territory.

2.         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of a territory in respect of an employment exercised in the other territory shall be taxable only in the first‑mentioned territory if:

            (a)     the recipient is present in the other territory for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the year of income concerned; and

            (b)     the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of that other territory; and

            (c)     the remuneration is not deductible in determining taxable profits of a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in that other territory; and

            (d)     the remuneration is, or upon the application of this Article will be, subject to tax in the first‑mentioned territory.

3.         Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a territory in international traffic shall be taxable only in that territory.

Article 17

1.         Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, income derived by entertainers (such as theatrical, motion picture, radio or television artistes and musicians) and sportspersons from their personal activities as such may be taxed in the territory in which these activities are exercised.

2.         Where income in respect of the personal activities of an entertainer or a sportsperson as such accrues not to that entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the territory in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised.

Article 18

However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other territory if the services are rendered in that other territory and the recipient is a resident of that other territory who:

            (a)     is a citizen or national of that territory; or

            (b)     did not become a resident of that territory solely for the purpose of performing the services.

2.         The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with any trade or business carried on by any authority referred to in paragraph 1\. In that case, the provisions of Article 15 or Article 16, as the case may be, shall apply.

Article 20

Students

Where a student, who is a resident of a territory or who was a resident of that territory immediately before visiting the other territory and who is temporarily present in that other territory solely for the purpose of the student's education, receives payments from sources outside that other territory for the purpose of the student's maintenance or education, those payments shall be exempt from tax in that other territory.

Article 21

Other income

1.         Items of income of a resident of a territory, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that territory.

2.         However, any such income derived by a resident of a territory from sources in the other territory may also be taxed in that other territory.

3.         The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from real property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, derived by a resident of a territory where that income is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base situated in the other territory. In that case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

Article 22

Methods of elimination of double taxation

Subject to the provisions of the law of a territory from time to time in force relating to the allowance of a credit against tax payable in that territory of tax paid outside that territory (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), tax paid under the law of the other territory and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of the first‑mentioned territory from sources in the other territory shall be allowed as a credit against tax payable in the first‑mentioned territory in respect of that income. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the tax in the first‑mentioned territory on that income computed in accordance with its taxation laws and regulations.

Article 23

Mutual agreement procedure

1.         Where a person considers that the actions of the competent authority of one or both of the territories result or will result for the person in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement, the person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those territories concerning taxes to which this Agreement applies, present a case to the competent authority of the territory of which the person is a resident. The case must be presented within 3 years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

2.         The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case with the competent authority of the other territory, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Agreement. The solution so reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the territories.

3.         The competent authorities shall jointly endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Agreement.

4.         The competent authorities may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Agreement.

Article 24

Exchange of information

1.         The competent authorities shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out this Agreement or of the domestic law of each of the territories concerning taxes to which this Agreement applies insofar as the taxation under that law is not contrary to this Agreement. Any information received by the competent authority of a territory shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic law of that territory and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which this Agreement applies. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

2.         In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on the competent authority of a territory the obligation:

            (a)     to carry out administrative measures at variance with the law or the administrative practice of that or of the other territory; or

            (b)     to supply information which is not obtainable under the law or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other territory; or

            (c)     to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or to supply information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.

Article 25

Entry into effect

This Agreement shall enter into effect on the date on which the Australian Commerce and Industry Office and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office notify each other in writing that the last of such things has been done as is necessary to give this Agreement effect in the domestic law of the respective territories. This Agreement shall have effect:

            (a)     in both territories, in respect of:

            (c)     in respect of other tax of the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Department of Taxation, Ministry of Finance, Taipei is applied, in relation to income, profits or gains of any year of income beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Agreement enters into effect.

Article 26

Termination

This Agreement shall continue in effect indefinitely, but an authority administering either territory may, on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into effect, give to the other written notice of termination and, in that event, the Agreement shall cease to be effective:

            (a)     in both territories, in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non‑resident, in relation to income, profits or gains derived on or after the first day of the second month next following that in which the notice of termination is given;

            (b)     in respect of other tax of the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Australian Taxation Office is applied, in relation to income, profits or gains of any year of income beginning on or after 1 July in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given;

            (c)     in respect of other tax of the territory in which the taxation law administered by the Department of Taxation, Ministry of Finance, Taipei is applied, in relation to income, profits or gains of any year of income beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given.

## 224  Application rule for credits arising under the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_

(1)       Despite the repeal of Division 19 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, that Division continues to apply, after the commencement of this item, in relation to:

                     (a)  a determination made by a person under the Division before the commencement of this item; or

                     (b)  a credit to which the Division applied before the commencement of this item;

as if the repeal had not happened.

(2)       The Commissioner may make determinations under that Division as it so continues to apply.

(3)       Section 24 of the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_, as inserted by item 211 of this Schedule, applies from the commencement of this item in relation to any income year.

## 225  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 226  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example:    For the 2006‑07 income year, Smart Investor Pty Ltd, an Australian resident private investment company, has assessable foreign income in the passive income class on which it has paid foreign tax for which it wishes to claim a foreign tax credit. The company also has a tax loss for the year from its Australian investments. When it lodges its tax return for the year it does not elect to claim a deduction for any of the tax loss under section 79DA of the ITAA 1936, because the Australian tax payable on its passive foreign income equals the foreign tax it has paid.

                   In 2009 the amount of foreign tax payable in respect of some foreign rental income it had included in its return for the 2006‑07 year is reduced and Smart Investor receives a refund of the difference in foreign tax. Smart Investor Pty Ltd then applies to be able to make an election under section 79DA, that is, after the _Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Act 2007_ (which repeals section 79DA) receives Royal Assent. The Commissioner allows Smart Investor to submit an election to claim a deduction for so much of its 2006‑07 tax loss as to reduce the amount of Australian tax payable on its 2006‑07 assessable foreign income to the revised foreign tax paid, by the end of 2009.

                   Despite the repeal of section 79DA, item 226 allows the Commissioner to permit an election to be lodged after the return for 2006‑07 has been lodged, and to amend Smart Investor’s assessment for that year, because these actions relate to a thing done, and periods ending, before the repeal of section 79DA applies.

## Schedule 1

## 70  Definitions

In this Part:

**_commencement day_** means the day this Schedule commences.

**_new Act_** means the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_ as amended by this Schedule.

**_old Act_** means the _International Tax Agreements Act 1953_ as in force before the commencement day.

## 71  Transitional—amendments operate prospectively

(1)       This item applies to a provision of an agreement that has the force of law on the commencement day because of section 5 of the new Act.

(2)       Despite section 5 of the new Act, for each day before the commencement day, the provision of the agreement continues to have the force of law in accordance with the old Act.

## 72  Transitional—new description of agreements do not affect their legal operation

(1)       This item applies to a provision of an agreement that:

                     (a)  had the force of law under the old Act immediately before the commencement day; and

                     (b)  is not covered by section 5 or 5A of the new Act.

(2)       To avoid doubt, the provision continues to have the force of law, on and after the commencement day, under the new Act.

_Note:       This means the changes made by this Schedule have no effect on the provision’s legal operation._
