             (1)  This section applies in relation to each relevant part of a taxpayer’s income of the year of income that consists of income in respect of which a provision of an agreement limits the amount of Australian tax payable.

             (2)  The taxpayer is entitled, in respect of each relevant part of the taxpayer’s income of the year of income to which this section applies, to a rebate of the amount (if any) by which the amount ascertained in accordance with the last preceding section as the amount of Australian tax payable in respect of that part exceeds the limit applicable under the provisions of the agreement in relation to that part.

             (3)  The rebate to which a taxpayer is entitled under this section in respect of a relevant part of the taxpayer’s income shall be allowed in the taxpayer’s assessment in respect of income of the year of income in the assessable income of which that part is included.

             (4)  A rebate, or the sum of the rebates, a taxpayer is entitled to under subsection (2), in respect of income of a year of income, must not exceed the amount of Australian tax payable in respect of the taxpayer’s taxable income of that year after all other rebates of, and deductions from, that tax have been taken into account.

##### <a id="17A"></a>17A  Withholding tax

             (1)  Where a provision of an agreement limits the amount of Australian tax payable in respect of a dividend or a royalty, being a dividend or a royalty in respect of which withholding tax is payable, and the amount of that withholding tax exceeds the limit specified in the agreement, the liability of the taxpayer for the withholding tax shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the excess.

             (2)  Where the liability of a taxpayer for withholding tax payable in respect of a unit trust dividend would have been reduced in pursuance of subsection (1) if that unit trust dividend had been a dividend paid to the taxpayer by a company that is a resident, that liability shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount by which the liability would have been reduced if the unit trust dividend had been a dividend paid to the taxpayer by a company that is a resident.

             (3)  In subsection (2):

                    <a name="unit-trust-dividend"></a>**_unit trust dividend_** means a unit trust dividend within the meaning of Division 6B or 6C of Part III of the Assessment Act.

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  a provision (**_basic royalty provision_**) of an agreement is covered by either of the following subparagraphs:

                              (i)  paragraph 1 or 2 of Article 12 of the Chinese agreement;

                             (ii)  a corresponding provision of another agreement; and

                     (b)  another provision of the agreement expressly excludes particular royalties (**_excluded royalties_**) from the scope of the basic royalty provision;

section 128B of the Assessment Act (which deals with liability for withholding tax) does not apply to the excluded royalties.

             (5)  Section 128B of the Assessment Act (which deals with liability for withholding tax) does not apply to the payment of a royalty as defined in subsection 6(1) of that Act if:

                     (a)  the royalty is paid to a person who is a resident of a Contracting State or territory (other than Australia) for the purposes of an agreement; and

                     (b)  the agreement does not treat the amount paid as a royalty.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Source of dividends

             (1)  Where a company is not a resident of Australia but, for the purposes of a law of a country with which, or with the government of which, an agreement has been made (being a law which imposes foreign tax), is resident in that other country, a dividend paid by the company shall, for the purposes of the agreement, be deemed to be derived from a source in that country.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not limit the operation of a provision of an agreement by virtue of which a dividend is deemed to be derived from a source outside Australia.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Collection of tax due to the United States of America

             (1)  The purpose of this section is to enable the Government of Australia to give effect to its obligation under paragraph (5) of Article 25 of the United States convention and accordingly the amounts of United States tax to which this section applies are amounts of United States tax the collection of which is necessary in order to ensure that the benefit of exemptions from United States tax, or of reductions in rates of United States tax, provided for by the convention is not received by a person not entitled to that benefit.

             (2)  Where a person is liable to pay an amount of United States tax to which this section applies, there is payable by that person to the Commissioner as a debt due to the Queen on behalf of Australia an amount equivalent to that amount, and the amount so payable may be sued for and recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction by the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner suing in his or her official name.

             (3)  An amount payable to the Commissioner under the last preceding subsection may be collected by the Commissioner under section 218 of the Assessment Act and, for that purpose, a reference in that section to a taxpayer shall be read as a reference to the person by whom that amount is payable and a reference to an amount due by a taxpayer in respect of tax shall be read as a reference to the amount so payable.

             (4)  The Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner may, by writing under his or her hand, certify:

                     (a)  that, on a date specified in the certificate, a person specified in the certificate was liable to pay an amount of United States tax;

                     (b)  that that amount was an amount of United   States tax to which this section applies; and

                     (c)  that an amount specified in the certificate is an amount equivalent to the amount of   United States tax;

and such a certificate is, in all courts and for all purposes, evidence of the matters stated in the certificate and that the person specified in the certificate has, during the period from the date specified in the certificate until the date of the certificate, continued to be liable to pay the amount of United States tax.

             (5)  The Commissioner shall pay to the Government of the United States of America an amount equal to any amount paid or recovered by virtue of this section.

             (6)  In this section:

                    <a name="tax"></a><a name="united-state"></a>**_United States_****_tax_** has the same meaning as in the United States convention.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Regulations

                   The power to make regulations conferred by section 266 of the Assessment Act shall be deemed to extend to the making of regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Application of this Act

                   Nothing in this Act affects assessments in respect of income, or the ascertainment of credits against tax on income, of a year of income before the year of income that commenced on 1 July 1953.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Gathering and exchanging information

             (1)  The Commissioner or an officer authorised by the Commissioner may use the information gathering provisions for the purpose of gathering information to be exchanged in accordance with the Commissioner’s obligations under an international agreement.

             (2)  Making a record of, and exchanging, information in accordance with the Commissioner’s obligations under an international agreement is not a breach of a provision of a taxation law that prohibits the Commissioner or an officer from making a record of, or disclosing, information.

Example:    An example of such a provision is section 3C of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

             (3)  Subsections (1) and (2) have effect whether or not the information relates to Australian tax.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="inform-gather-provision"></a>**_information gathering provision_** means a provision of a taxation law that allows the Commissioner:

                     (a)  to access land, premises, documents, information, goods or other property; or

                     (b)  to require or direct a person to provide information; or

                     (c)  to require or direct a person to appear before the Commissioner or an officer and give evidence or produce documents.

                    <a name="intern-agreem"></a>**_international agreement_** means:

                     (a)  an agreement given the force of law under this Act; or

                     (b)  some other agreement that allows for the exchange of information on tax matters between Australia and:

                              (i)  a foreign country or a constituent part of a foreign country; or

                             (ii)  an overseas territory.

                    <a name="taxat-law"></a>**_taxation law_** has the same meaning as in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Relief from double taxation where profits adjusted

Application

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  Australia has an agreement with one of the following (a **_treaty partner_**):

                              (i)  a foreign country or a constituent part of a foreign country;

                             (ii)  an overseas territory; and

                     (b)  the treaty partner taxes profits, or purports to tax profits, in accordance with, or consistent with the principles of:

                              (i)  if the treaty partner is the United Kingdom—Article 9 of the 2003 United Kingdom convention; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—a corresponding provision of another agreement.

Note:          Article 9 of the 2003 United Kingdom Convention deals with associated enterprises.

Object

             (2)  The object of this section is to prevent double taxation of the profits, to the extent that the Commissioner considers the taxation of the profits by the treaty partner to be in accordance with the agreement.

Adjustment of taxable income or tax loss

             (3)  The Commissioner may determine the amount of a taxpayer’s taxable income or tax loss of a year of income to be an amount that is appropriate having regard to the object of this section.

Note:          The Commissioner may amend an assessment at any time to give effect to this section: see subsection 170(11) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

(a)     it has a building site or construction or installation project in that State, or it undertakes a supervisory or consultancy activity in that State connected with such a site or project, but only if that site, project or activity lasts more than 12 months;

(b)     it maintains substantial equipment for rental or other purposes within that other State (excluding equipment let under a hire-purchase agreement) for a period of more than 12 months; or

(c)     a person acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State manufactures or processes in the first-mentioned State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise.

4       (a)     The duration of activities under subparagraph (a) of paragraph 3 will be determined by aggregating the periods during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by associated enterprises provided that the activities of the enterprise in that State are connected with the activities carried on in that State by its associate.

7       An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting  State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such brokers or agents are acting in the ordinary course of their business as such.

8       The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself make either company a permanent establishment of the other.

ARTICLE 6

Income from real property

1       Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from real property may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the real property is situated.

2       The term “real property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting  State in which the property is situated.  The term shall in any case include:

4       The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of real property.

5       The provisions of paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Article shall also apply to the income from real property of an enterprise.

ARTICLE 7

Business profits

1       The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated in that other State.  If the enterprise carries on business in that manner, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

2       Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated in that other State, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises.

3       In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

4       Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment.  In such cases that law shall be applied, having regard to the information that is available, consistently with the principles of this Article.

5       No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

6       Where profits include items of income or gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

7       Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law of a Contracting State relating to tax imposed on profits from insurance with non-residents provided that if the relevant law in force in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Convention is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

ARTICLE 8

Shipping and air transport

1       Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.

2       Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting  State from the operation of ships or aircraft may be taxed in the other Contracting  State to the extent that they are profits derived from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that other State.

3       For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include:

         (a)     profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft; and

         (b)     profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods or merchandise;

provided such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is directly connected or ancillary to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.

4       The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency, but only to so much of the profits so derived as is attributable to the participant in proportion to its share in the joint operation.

5       For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from:

         (a)     the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a Contracting State and are discharged at the same or another place in that State; or

         (b)     the use of a ship or aircraft for haulage, survey or dredging activities, or for exploration or extraction activities in relation to natural resources, where such activities are undertaken in a Contracting State;

shall be treated as profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that State.

ARTICLE 9

Associated enterprises

1       Where:

         (a)     an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or

         (b)     the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State;

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which might, but for those conditions, have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2       Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits accruing to an enterprise.  In such cases that law shall be applied, having regard to the information that is available, consistently with the principles of this Article.

3       Where profits on which an enterprise of a Contracting State has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of the provisions of paragraphs 1 or 2, in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and charged to tax in that other State, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first-mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax it has charged on those profits.  In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

ARTICLE 10

Dividends

1       Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of its tax, being dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

2       However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but the tax charged shall not exceed:

         (a)     5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and

         (b)     15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.

3       Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned shares representing 80 per cent or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for a 12 month period ending on the date the dividend is declared and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends:

(a)     has its principal class of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (o) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 and regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges;

(b)     is owned directly or indirectly by one or more companies whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (o) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 and regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges; or

(c)     does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph but the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State determines, in accordance with the law of that State, that the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations did not have as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of benefits under this Convention.  The competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State shall consult the competent authority of the other Contracting State before refusing to grant benefits of this Convention under this subparagraph.

4       The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident and also includes any other item which, under the laws of the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividend is a resident, is treated as a dividend or distribution of a company.

5       The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.

6       Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, being dividends beneficially owned by a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State, except insofar as the holding in respect of which such dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.  This paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of the United   Kingdom for the purposes of United Kingdom tax.

7       No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.

8       For the purposes of paragraph 3 of this Article, the term “principal class of shares” means the ordinary or common shares of the company, provided that such class of shares represents the majority of the voting power and value of the company.  If no single class of ordinary or common shares represents the majority of the voting power and value of the company, the “principal class of shares” is that class or those classes that in the aggregate represent a majority of the voting power and value of the company.

ARTICLE 11

Interest

<u> </u>

1       Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2       However, that interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

3       Notwithstanding paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if:

(a)     the interest is derived by a Contracting State or by a political or administrative sub-division or a local authority thereof, or by any other body exercising governmental functions in a Contracting State, or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State; or

(b)     the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer.  For the purposes of this Article, the term “financial institution” means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance.

4       Notwithstanding paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph (b) of that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if the interest is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans.

5       The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, and income from any other form of indebtedness.  The term “interest” also includes income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.  The term “interest” shall not include any item which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10 of this Convention.

6       The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, subparagraph (b) of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid or credited is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case, the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.

7       Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax.  Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and that interest is borne by that permanent establishment, then the interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

8       Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid or credited exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which might reasonably have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

9       No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.

ARTICLE 12

Royalties

1       Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2       However, those royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3       The term “royalties” in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for:

         (a)     the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right;

         (b)     the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information;

         (c)     the supply of any ancillary and subsidiary assistance that is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of any such item as is mentioned in subparagraph (a) or (b) of this paragraph;

         (d)     the use of or the right to use:

                  (i)      motion picture films; or

                  (ii)     films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio or other broadcasting; or

         (e)     total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph.

4       The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated in that other State, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with that permanent establishment.  In that case the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.

5       Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax.  Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6       Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which might reasonably have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such case, the excess paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

7       The provisions of this Article shall not apply if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the rights in respect of which the royalties are paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.

ARTICLE 13

Alienation of property

1       Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of real property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2       Income or gains from the alienation of property, other than real property, forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such income or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State.

4       Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of any shares or other interests in a company, or of an interest of any kind in a partnership, trust or other entity, where the value of the assets of such entity, whether they are held directly or indirectly (including through one or more interposed entities, such as, for example, through a chain of companies), is principally attributable to real property situated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

5       An individual who elects, under the taxation law of a Contracting State, to defer taxation on income or gains relating to property which would otherwise be taxed in that State upon the individual ceasing to be a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax, shall, if the individual is a resident of the other State, be taxable on income or gains from the subsequent alienation of that property only in that other State.

6       Nothing in this Convention affects the application of a law of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply.

7       In this Article, the term “real property” has the same meaning as it has in Article 6.

8       The situation of interests or rights referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 6 shall be determined for the purposes of this Article in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 6.

9       The provisions of this Article shall not affect the right of the United Kingdom to levy according to its laws a tax chargeable in respect of income or gains from the alienation of any property on a person who is a resident of the United Kingdom at any time during the fiscal year in which the property is alienated, or has been so resident at any time during the 6 years immediately preceding that year.

ARTICLE 14

Income from employment

1       Subject to the provisions of Articles 17 and 18 of this Convention, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State.  If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived from that exercise may be taxed in that other State.

2       Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:

         (a)     the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year or year of income of that other State; and

         (b)     the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and

         (c)     the remuneration is not deductible in determining taxable profits of a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State.

3       Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the enterprise operating the ship or aircraft is a resident.

4       In relation to remuneration of a director of a company derived from the company the preceding provisions of this Article shall apply as if the remuneration were remuneration of an employee in respect of an employment and as if the references to an employer were references to the company.

ARTICLE 15

Fringe benefits

1       Where, except for the application of this Article, a fringe benefit is taxable in both Contracting States the benefit will be taxable only in the Contracting State which would have the primary taxing right over that benefit if the value of the benefit were paid to the employee as ordinary employment income.

2.      For the purposes of this Article:

         (a)     “fringe benefit” has the meaning it has under Australia’s _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment_ Act _1986 (Commonwealth)_, as it may be amended from time to time, and does not include a benefit arising from the acquisition of an option over shares under an employee share scheme;

         (b)     a Contracting State has a “primary taxing right” to the extent that it has a taxing right under this Convention in respect of the remuneration for the relevant employment and the other Contracting State is required under this Convention to allow relief for any taxes imposed in respect of such remuneration by the first-mentioned Contracting State.

ARTICLE 16

Entertainers and sportspersons

1       Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14 of this Convention, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

2       Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to that person but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14 of this Convention, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised.

         (a)     is a national of that State; or

         (b)     did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services.

2       The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with any trade or business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority of that State.  In that case, the provisions of Article 14, 15 or 16, as the case may be, shall apply.

ARTICLE 19

ARTICLE 20

Other income

1       Items of income beneficially owned by a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State.

ARTICLE 22

Elimination of double taxation

(a)     United Kingdom tax paid under the laws of the United Kingdom and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income or gains derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in the United Kingdom shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income;

(b)     Where a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and is not a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax pays a dividend to a company which is a resident of Australia and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power of the first-mentioned company, the credit shall include the United Kingdom tax paid by that first-mentioned company in respect of that portion of its profits out of which the dividend is paid.

2       Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):

(a)     Australian tax payable under the laws of Australia and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, on income or chargeable gains from sources within Australia (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Australian tax is computed;

(b)     in the case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of Australia to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any Australian tax for which credit may be allowed under the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph) the Australian tax payable by the company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid.

2       Where under this Convention any income or gains are relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the law in force in the other Contracting State, an individual in respect of that income or those gains is exempt from tax by virtue of being a temporary resident of the other State within the meaning of the applicable tax laws of that other State, then the relief to be allowed under this Convention in the first-mentioned State shall not apply to the extent that that income or those gains are exempt from tax in the other State.

ARTICLE 24

Partnerships

         Where a partnership is treated as a taxable unit under the law of a Contracting State and under any provision of this Convention is entitled, as a resident of that State, to relief from tax in the other Contracting State on any income or gains, that provision shall not be construed as restricting the right of that other State to tax any member of the partnership who is a resident of that other State on that member’s share of such income or gains; but any such income or gains shall be treated for the purposes of Article 22 of this Convention as income or gains from sources in the first-mentioned State.

ARTICLE 25

Non-discrimination

1       Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.

2       The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances.

4       Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected.

5       Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to individuals who are residents of the other Contracting State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident.

         (a)     is designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes;

2       The competent authority shall endeavour, if the case appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting  State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Convention.

3       The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall jointly endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention.  They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Convention.

5       For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States.  Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of this Article or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.

ARTICLE 27

Exchange of information

1       The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant to the administration or enforcement of the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes to which this Convention applies insofar as the taxation under those laws is not contrary to this Convention.  The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1 of this Convention.  Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic law of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which this Convention applies.  Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes.  They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

2       If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall obtain that information in the same manner and to the same extent as if the tax of the first-mentioned State were the tax of that other State and were being imposed by that other State, notwithstanding that the other State may not, at that time, need such information for the purposes of its own tax.

**2003****UNITED KINGDOM****NOTES**

No LGB 03/170

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade presents its compliments to the British High Commission to Australia and has the honour to refer to the Convention between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains which has been signed today (the “Convention”).

The Department has the honour to make the following proposals on behalf of the Government of Australia:

_1.       With reference generally to the application of the Convention (including these Notes),_

the Contracting States agree that:

(a)   the term “income or gains” includes “profits”;

(b)   the term “laws” includes the full body of law, and is not limited to statutory law;

(c)   the terms “paid or credited” and “payments or credits” shall not include the recording of internal transactions between a permanent establishment and another part of the same enterprise;

(d)   the expression “any provision of the laws of a Contracting State which is designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes” includes:

(i)        measures designed to address thin capitalisation, dividend stripping and transfer pricing;

(ii)       controlled foreign company, transferor trust and foreign investment fund rules;

(iii)       measures designed to ensure that taxes can be effectively recovered (conservancy measures); and

(e)   nothing in the Convention shall be construed as restricting, in any manner, the application of any provision of the laws of a Contracting State which is designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes.

_2._      _With reference to Article 5 (Permanent establishment),_

the Contracting States agree that the term “permanent establishment” fully encompasses the concept of a “fixed base” used in other double tax treaties in the context of independent personal services.

_3.      With reference to Article 7 (Business profits),_

the Contracting States agree that:

(a)   nothing in paragraph 3 of the Article shall permit the deduction of an expense which would not be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent enterprise which incurred the expense; and

(b)   where:

(i)        a resident of a Contracting State is beneficially entitled, whether directly or through one or more interposed trust estates, to a share of the business profits of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust estate other than a trust estate which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and

(ii)       in relation to that enterprise, that trustee would, in accordance with the principles of Article 5, have a permanent establishment in that other State,

the enterprise carried on by the trustee shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and that share of business profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment.

_4.         With reference to Article 9 (Associated enterprises),_

the Contracting States note that the expression “dealing wholly independently with one another” is included in paragraph 1 of the Article to conform to Australia’s consistent treaty practice and to address Australia’s concerns that the appropriate benchmark for determining the conditions operating between the associated enterprises should have regard to whether those dealings between the enterprises occurred on a truly independent basis.

_5.         With reference to Article 10 (Dividends),_

the Contracting States agree that if the relevant law in either Contracting State at the date of signature of the Convention is varied otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character, the Contracting States shall consult each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of paragraph 2 and 3 of the Article as may be appropriate.

_6.         With reference to Article 11 (Interest),_

the Contracting States agree that:

(a)   the term “financial institution” shall not include a corporate treasury or a member of a corporate group performing financing services for the group; and

(b)   nothing in the Convention shall have the effect of subjecting to tax in a Contracting State any interest paid by a resident of that State to a resident of the other State where the payer has outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and that interest is borne by that permanent establishment.

_7._         _With reference to Article 12 (Royalties),_

the Contracting States agree that:

(a)   the term “royalties” shall not include payments for the use of spectrum licences.  The provisions of Article 7 of the Convention shall apply to such payments; and

(b)   nothing in the Convention shall have the effect of subjecting to tax in a Contracting State any royalties paid by a resident of that State to a resident of the other State where the payer has outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment.

_8._         _With reference to Article 14 (Income from employment)_,

the Contracting States agree that:

(a)   income or gains derived by employees in relation to share option schemes shall be treated as “other similar remuneration” for the purposes of Article 14;  

(b)   unless the facts otherwise indicate, the period of employment to which the option relates shall be taken to be the period between the grant of the option and the date on which all the conditions for its exercise have been satisfied (the vesting of the option); and

(c)   where a resident of a Contracting State derives such income or gains, and

(i)        the period of employment to which the share option relates is the period between grant and vesting of the option;

(ii)       the employee remains in that employment at the date of alienation or exercise of the option; and

(iii)       that employment has been exercised by the employee in the other Contracting State during all or part of the period between grant and vesting of the option;

the proportion of the income or gain which shall be attributable to employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be determined in accordance with the ratio of the number of days of employment exercised in that State between grant and vesting of the option to the total number of days of employment exercised between grant and vesting of the option.

_9.         With reference to Article 25 (Non-discrimination),_

the Contracting States agree that:

(a)        in relation to paragraph 4 and subparagraph 6(c) of the Article, the reference to capital being owned or controlled “directly or indirectly” includes cases where the capital is held through a chain of companies or other entities; and

(b)        nothing in the Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting  State to allow tax rebates and credits in relation to dividends received by a person who is a resident of the other Contracting State.

_10.       With reference to Article 26 (Mutual agreement procedure) and Article 27 (Exchange of information),_

the Contracting States agree that the provisions of the Articles shall have effect from the date of entry into force of the Convention, without regard to the date of the relevant transactions or the taxable or chargeable period to which the matter relates.

_11.     With reference to Article 26 (Mutual agreement procedure),_

the Contracting States agree that in relation to paragraph 1 of the Article, the applicable time limits in the domestic laws bearing on the time available for presenting a case to the relevant competent authority shall apply, whether or not those applicable time limits specifically refer to the competent authority process.

_12.     Miscellaneous_

The Contracting States agree that the two Governments shall consult each other at intervals of not more than five years regarding the terms, operation and application of the Convention with a view to ensuring that it continues to serve the purposes of avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion.  The first such consultation shall take place no later than the end of the fifth year after the entry into force of the Convention.

If the foregoing proposals are acceptable to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Department has the honour to propose that the present Note and the High Commission’s confirmatory Note in reply shall constitute an Agreement on certain matters between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Australia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, which shall enter into force at the same time as the entry into force of the Convention.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the British High Commission to Australia the assurances of its highest consideration.

For the purposes of this paragraph, in determining an individual’s permanent home, regard shall be given to the place where the individual dwells with his family, and in determining the Contracting State with which an individual’s personal and economic relations are closer, regard shall be given to his citizenship (if he is a citizen of one of the Contracting States).

(3)   An individual who is deemed to be a resident of one of the Contracting States for any year of income, or taxable year, as the case may be by reason of the provisions of paragraph (2) shall, for all purposes of this Convention, be deemed to be a resident only of that State for such year.

(4)   Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State if:

            and are, after such purchase or production, subjected to substantial processing in that other State by an enterprise where either enterprise participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the other enterprise, or where the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the other enterprise, or where the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of both enterprises.

(5)   An enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because that enterprise carries on business in that other State through a broker, general commission agent, or any other agent of independent status, where such broker or agent is acting in the ordinary course of his business as a broker, general commission agent or other agent of independent status.

(6)   The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.

(7)   The principles set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall be applied in determining for purposes of this Convention whether there is a permanent establishment in a State other than one of the Contracting States and whether an enterprise other than an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States.

ARTICLE 7

<u>Business Profits</u>

(1)   The business profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the business profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the business profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the business profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are reasonably connected with the profits (including executive and general administrative expenses) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   No business profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(5)   For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, the business profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

(6)   Where business profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

(7)   Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that, on the basis of the available information, the determination of the profits of the permanent establishment is consistent with the principles stated in this Article.

(8)   Nothing in this Article shall in a Contracting State prevent the operation in that State of its law relating specifically to the taxation of any person who carries on the business of any form of insurance (as long as that law as in effect on the date of signature of this Convention is not varied otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character).

ARTICLE 8

<u>Shipping and Air Transport</u>

(1)   Profits derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States from the operation in international traffic of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that State. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation in international traffic of ships or aircraft include:

     (a)  profits from the lease on a full basis of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic by the lessee, provided that the lessor either operates ships or aircraft otherwise than solely between places in the other Contracting State or regularly leases ships or aircraft on a full basis; and

     (b)  profits from the lease of ships or aircraft on a bare boat basis or of containers and related equipment, provided that such lease is merely incidental to the operation in international traffic of ships or aircraft by the lessor and the leased ships or aircraft are operated in international traffic, or the containers and related equipment are used in international traffic, by the lessee.

ARTICLE 9

<u>Associated Enterprises</u>

(1)        Where:

     (a)  an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1), in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

(3)   Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the income to be attributed to an enterprise, provided that, on the basis of the available information, the determination of that tax liability is consistent with the principles stated in this Article.

ARTICLE 10

(1)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such dividends may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends.

(3)   The term “dividends” in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax.

(4)   The provisions of paragraph (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, being the State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Where a company is a resident of one of the Contracting States, the other Contracting State may not impose any tax on dividends paid by the company, except insofar as:

     (a)  a resident of that other State is beneficially entitled to the dividends;

     (b)  the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State; or

     (c)  that other State does not impose a tax of the kind described in paragraph (6) (excluding the accumulated earnings tax and the personal holding company tax imposed by the United States) and the dividends are paid out of profits attributable to one or more permanent establishments which such company had in that other State, provided that the gross income attributable to such permanent establishments constituted at least 50 percent of such company’s gross income from all sources.

Where sub--paragraph (c) applies and sub--paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply, any such tax shall not exceed 15 percent of the dividends.

(6)   Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the income of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, tax in addition to the taxes referred to in Article 2 in relation to the first--mentioned Contracting State which are payable by a company which is a resident of the first--mentioned State, provided that any such additional tax shall not exceed 15 percent of the amount by which the taxable income of the first--mentioned company of a year of income exceeds the tax payable on that taxable income to the first--mentioned State. Any tax payable to a Contracting State on the undistributed profits of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State shall be calculated as if that company were not liable to the additional tax referred to in this paragraph and had paid dividends of such amount that tax equal to the amount of that additional tax would have been payable on the dividends in accordance with paragraph (2) of this Article.

ARTICLE 11

<u>Interest</u>

(1)   Interest from sources in one of the Contracting States, being interest to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(3)   Paragraph (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, has a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State or performs independent personal services in that other State from a fixed base situated therein and the indebtedness giving rise to the interest is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the case may be, shall apply.

(4)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Convention.

(5)   The term “interest” as used in this Convention includes income which, under the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income has its source, is assimilated to income from money lent.

(6)   A Contracting  State may not impose any tax on interest paid by a resident of the other Contracting  State, except insofar as:

     (a)  such interest has its source in the first--mentioned State, or is interest to which a resident of that State is beneficially entitled; or

     (b)  the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base of the beneficial owner of the interest situated in the first--mentioned State.

(7)   Interest shall be treated as income from sources in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political subdivision or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in one of the Contracting States or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to have its source in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(3)   Paragraph (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, has a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State or performs independent personal services in that other State from a fixed base situated therein, and the property or rights giving rise to the royalties are effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the case may be, shall apply.

(4)   The term “royalties” in this Article means:

     (a)  payments or credits of any kind to the extent to which they are consideration for the use of or the right to use any:

             (i)     copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right;

             (ii)     the supply of any assistance of an ancillary and subsidiary nature furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of knowledge or information referred to in sub--paragraph (b) (i) or of any other property or right to which this Article applies; or

            (iii)     a total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right described in this paragraph; or

     (c)  income derived from the sale, exchange or other disposition of any property or right described in this paragraph to the extent to which the amounts realized on such sale, exchange or other disposition are contingent on the productivity, use or further disposition of such property or right.

(5)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Convention.

(6) (a)  Royalties shall be treated as income from sources in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political subdivision or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in one of the Contracting States or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to have their source in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

     (b)  Where sub--paragraph (a) does not operate to treat royalties as being from sources in one of the Contracting States, and the royalties relate to use or the right to use in one of the Contracting States of any property or right described in paragraph (4), the royalties shall be treated as income from sources in that State.

For purposes of applying the United States credit in relation to income tax paid to   Australia the taxes referred to in sub--paragraph (1) (b) and paragraph (2) of Article 2 (Taxes Covered) shall be considered to be income taxes. No provision of this Convention relating to source of income shall apply in determining credits against United States tax for foreign taxes other than those referred to in sub--paragraph (1) (b) and paragraph (2) of Article 2 (Taxes Covered).

(2)   Subject to paragraph (4), United States tax paid under the law of the United States and in accordance with this Convention, other than United States tax imposed in accordance with paragraph (3) of Article 1 (Personal Scope) solely by reason of citizenship or by reason of an election by an individual under United States domestic law to be taxed as a resident of the United States, in respect of income derived from sources in the United States by a person who, under Australian law relating to Australian tax, is a resident of Australia shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of the income. The credit shall not exceed the amount of Australian tax payable on the income or any class thereof or on income from sources outside Australia. Subject to these general principles, the credit shall be in accordance with the provisions and subject to the limitations of the law of Australia as that law may be in force from time to time.

(3)   An Australian corporation that owns at least 10 percent of the voting power in a United States corporation is, in accordance with the law of Australia as in force at the date of signature of this Convention, entitled to a rebate in its assessment, at the average rate of tax payable by it, in respect of dividends paid by the United States corporation that are included in the taxable income of the Australian corporation. However, should the law as so in force be amended so that the rebate in relation to the dividends ceases to be allowable under that law, Australia shall allow credit under paragraph (2) for the United States tax paid on the profits out of which the dividends are paid as well as for the United States tax paid on the dividends.

(4)   For the purposes of computing United States tax, where a United States citizen is a resident of Australia, the United States shall allow as a credit against United   States tax the income tax paid to Australia after the credit referred to in paragraph (2). The credit so allowed against United States tax shall not reduce that portion of the United States tax that is creditable against Australian tax in accordance with paragraph (2).

ARTICLE 23

<u>Non--Discrimination</u>

(1)   Each Contracting State in enacting tax measures shall ensure that:

     (a)  citizens of a Contracting State who are residents of the other Contracting State shall not be subjected in that other State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation or connected requirements to which citizens of that other State who are residents of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected;

     (b)  except where the provisions of paragraph (1) of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises), paragraph (4) of Article 11 (Interest) or paragraph (5) of Article 12 (Royalties) apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of the resident of the first--mentioned State, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first--mentioned State;

     (c)  a corporation of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first--mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation or connected requirements to which other similar corporations of the first--mentioned State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected; and

     (d)  the taxation on a permanent establishment which a resident of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favorably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on residents of that other State that carry on the same activities in the same circumstances.

(2)   Nothing in this Article relates to any provision of the taxation laws of a Contracting State:

     (a)  in force on the date of signature of this Convention;

     (c)  reasonably designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes;

provided that, with respect to provisions covered by subparagraphs (b) or (c), such provisions (other than provisions in international agreements) do not discriminate between citizens or residents of the other Contracting State and those of any third State.

(3)   Without limiting by implication the interpretation of this Article, it is hereby declared that, except to the extent expressly so provided, nothing in the Article prevents a Contracting State from distinguishing in its taxation laws between residents and non--residents solely on the ground of their residence.

(4)   Where one of the Contracting States considers that the taxation measures of the other Contracting  State infringe the principles set forth in this Article the Contracting States shall consult together in an endeavor to resolve the matter.

The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of that action.

     (b)  Should the claim be considered to have merit by the competent authority of the Contracting  State to which the claim is made, that competent authority shall seek to come to an agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State with a view to the avoidance of taxation contrary to the provisions of this Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits or other procedural limitations in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

(2)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall seek to resolve by agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application or interpretation of this Convention. In particular the competent authorities of the Contracting States may agree:

     (c)  to the same determination of the source of particular items of income;

     (d)  to the same meaning of any term used in this Convention; or

     (e)  to which of the Contracting States an individual described in subparagraph (2) (c) of Article 4 (Residence) has closer personal and economic relations.

(3)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of this Article.

ARTICLE 25

<u>Exchange of Information</u>

(1)   The competent authorities shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or for the prevention of fraud or for the administration of statutory provisions concerning taxes to which this Convention applies provided the information is of a class that can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of each Contracting State with respect to its own taxes.

(2)   Any information so exchanged shall be treated as secret and shall not be disclosed to any persons other than those (including a Court or administrative body) concerned with the assessment, collection, administration or enforcement of, or with litigation with respect to, the taxes to which this Convention applies.

(4)   If specifically requested by the competent authority of one of the Contracting States, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall provide information under this Article in the form of copies of unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts or writings) to the same extent such documents can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect to its own taxes.

(5)   Each of the Contracting States shall endeavor to collect on behalf of the other Contracting State amounts equal to such taxes imposed by the other State as will ensure that any exemption or reduction in rate of tax granted under this Convention by that other State shall not be enjoyed by persons not entitled to such benefits.

ARTICLE 26

<u>Diplomatic and Consular Privileges</u>

Nothing in this Convention shall affect diplomatic and consular privileges under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

ARTICLE 27

(b)        in relation to that enterprise, that fiscally transparent entity (or trustee) would, in accordance with the principles of Article 5 (Permanent Establishment), have a permanent establishment in that other State, that enterprise carried on by that fiscally transparent entity (or trustee) shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and that share of business profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment.”.

**ARTICLE 6**

Article 10 of the Convention is omitted and the following Article is substituted:

“ARTICLE 10

<u>Dividends</u>

(1)        Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.
 (2)        However, those dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but:

(a)        the tax charged shall not exceed 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends, if the person beneficially entitled to those dividends is a company which holds directly at least 10 percent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and

(b)        the tax charged shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends to the extent to which those dividends are not within sub-paragraph (a), 

provided that if the relevant law in either Contracting State is varied after the effective date of this provision otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character, the Contracting States shall consult each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

(3)        Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the person who is beneficially entitled to the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned shares representing 80 percent or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for a 12-month period ending on the date the dividend is declared and:

(a)        is a qualified person by reason of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph (2) of Article 16 (Limitation on Benefits); or

(b)        is entitled to benefits with respect to the dividends under paragraph (5) of that Article.

(4)        (a)        Sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph (2) and paragraph (3) shall not apply in the case of dividends paid by a Regulated Investment Company (RIC) or a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). 

(b)        In the case of dividends paid by a RIC, sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph (2) shall apply.

(c)        In the case of dividends paid by a REIT, sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph (2) shall apply only if:

(i)    the person beneficially entitled to the dividends is an individual holding an interest of not more than 10 percent in the REIT; 

(ii)   the dividends are paid with respect to a class of stock that is publicly traded and the person beneficially entitled to the dividends holds an interest of not more than 5 percent of any class of the REIT’s stock; or

(iii)  the person beneficially entitled to the dividends holds an interest of not more than 10 percent in the REIT and the gross value of no single interest in real property held by the REIT exceeds 10 percent of the gross value of the REIT’s total interest in real property.

(d)        Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (c), sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph (2) shall apply with respect to dividends paid by a REIT to a listed Australian property trust (“LAPT”). However, if the responsible entity for the LAPT knows or has reason to know that one or more unitholders each owns 5 percent or more of the beneficial interests in the LAPT, each of such 5 percent or more unitholders shall, for purposes of this paragraph, be deemed to hold such proportion of the LAPT’s direct interest in the REIT as equals that person’s proportionate interest in the LAPT and shall be deemed to be beneficially entitled to the REIT dividends paid with respect thereto, and the provisions of sub-paragraph (c) shall apply to that person. For purposes of this paragraph, dividends paid with respect to REIT shares held by an LAPT shall be deemed to be paid with respect to a class of stock that is publicly traded. For these purposes, a “listed Australian property trust” means an Australian unit trust registered as a “Managed Investment Scheme” under the Australian Corporations Act in which the principal class of units is listed on a recognized stock exchange in Australia and regularly traded on one or more recognized stock exchanges (as defined in Article 16 (Limitation on Benefits)).

(5)     The above provisions of this Article shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated in that other State, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated in that other State, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In that case the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the case may be, shall apply.

(6)        The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, as well as other amounts which are subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax.

(7)        Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company—being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled—except insofar as the holding in respect of which such dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor may it impose tax on a company’s undistributed profits, except as provided in paragraph (8), even if the dividends paid consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

(8)        A company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States and that has a permanent establishment in the other State or that is subject to tax in the other State on a net basis on its income or gains that may be taxed in the other State under Article 6 (Income from Real Property) or under paragraph (1) or (3) of Article 13 (Alienation of Property) may be subject in that other State to a tax in addition to the tax allowable under the other provisions of this Convention. Such tax, however, may be imposed on only the portion of the business profits of the company attributable to the permanent establishment and the portion of the income or gains referred to in the preceding sentence that is subject to tax under Article 6 (Income from Real Property) or under paragraph (1) or (3) of Article 13 (Alienation of Property) that, in the case of the United States, represents the dividend equivalent amount of such profits, income or gains and, in the case of Australia, is an amount that is analogous to the dividend equivalent amount. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of a company which:

(a)     is a qualified person by reason of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph (2) of Article 16 (Limitation on Benefits) of this Convention; or 

(b)     is entitled to benefits with respect to the dividends under paragraph (5) of that Article.

(9)     The tax referred to in paragraph (8) may not be imposed at a rate in excess of the rate specified in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph (2).”.

**ARTICLE 7**

Article 11 of the Convention is omitted and the following Article is substituted:

“ARTICLE 11

<u>Interest</u>

(1)        Interest arising in one of the Contracting States, being interest to which a resident of the other Contracting  State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)        However, that interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest.

(3)        Notwithstanding paragraph (2), interest arising in one of the Contracting States to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if:

(a)     the interest is derived by one of the Contracting States or by a political or administrative sub-division or a local authority thereof, or by any other body exercising governmental functions in a Contracting State, or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State;

(b)     the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer. For the purposes of this Article, the term “financial institution” means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance.

(4)        (a)     Notwithstanding paragraph (3), interest referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest if the interest is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans.

(b)        Nothing in this Article shall be construed as restricting, in any manner, the right of a Contracting State to apply any anti-avoidance provisions of its taxation law.

(5)        The term “interest” in this Article means interest from government securities or from bonds or debentures (including premiums attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures), whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, interest from any other form of indebtedness, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the law of the Contracting State in which the income arises. Income dealt with in Article 10 (Dividends) and penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purposes of this Article.

(6)        The provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated in that other State, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated in that other State, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In that case the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the case may be, shall apply.

(7)        Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and that interest is borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then the interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(8)        Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might reasonably have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of that relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

(9)        Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4):

(a)        interest that is paid by a resident of one of the Contracting States and that is determined with reference to the profits of the issuer or of one of its associated enterprises, as defined in sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (1) of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises), being interest to which a resident of the other State is beneficially entitled, also may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the laws of that State, at a rate not exceeding 15 percent of the gross amount of the interest; and

(b)        interest that is paid with respect to the ownership interests in a person used for the securitization of real estate mortgages or other assets, to the extent that the amount of interest paid exceeds the normal rate of return on publicly-traded debt instruments with a similar risk profile, may be taxed by each State in accordance with its domestic law.

(10)      Where interest expense is deductible in determining the profits, income or gains of a company resident in one of the Contracting States, being profits, income or gains which:

(a)     are attributable to a permanent establishment of that company in the other Contracting  State; or

(b)     may be taxed in the other Contracting State under Article 6 (Income from Real Property) or paragraph (1) or (3) of Article 13 (Alienation of Property),

and that interest expense exceeds the interest paid by that permanent establishment or paid with respect to the debt secured by real property located in the other Contracting State, the amount of that excess shall be deemed to be interest arising in that other Contracting State to which a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State is beneficially entitled.”.

**ARTICLE 8**

Article 12 of the Convention is amended by:

(a)        omitting “10” and substituting “5” in paragraph (2); and

(b)        omitting sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph (4) and substituting:

“(a)    payments or credits of any kind to the extent to which they are consideration for the use of or the right to use any:

(i)      copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; 

(ii)      motion picture films; or 

(iii)     films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio or other broadcasting;”.

**ARTICLE 9**

Article 13 of the Convention is amended by:

(a)        omitting paragraph (3) and substituting:

“(3)         Income or gains from the alienation of property, other than real property, that forms part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has in the other Contracting State or pertains to a fixed base available in that other State to a resident of the first-mentioned State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including income or gains from the alienation of that permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of that fixed base, may be taxed in that other State.

(4)        Income or gains derived by an enterprise of one of the Contracting States from the alienation of ships, aircraft or containers operated or used in international traffic or property, other than real property, pertaining to the operation or use of such ships, aircraft, or containers shall be taxable only in that State.

(5)        Where an individual who, upon ceasing to be a resident of one of the Contracting States, is treated under the taxation law of that State as having alienated any property and is taxed in that State by reason thereof, the individual may elect to be treated for the purposes of taxation in the other Contracting State as if the individual had, immediately before ceasing to be a resident of the first-mentioned State, alienated and re-acquired the property for an amount equal to its fair market value at that time.

(6)        An individual who elects, under the taxation law of a Contracting State, to defer taxation on income or gains relating to property which would otherwise be taxed in that State upon the individual ceasing to be a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax, shall, if the individual is a resident of the other State, be taxable on income or gains from the subsequent alienation of that property only in that other State.

(7)        Except as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Article, each Contracting State may tax capital gains in accordance with the provisions of its domestic law.”; and

(b)        renumbering paragraph (4) as paragraph (8).

**ARTICLE 10**

Article 16 of the Convention is omitted and the following Article is substituted:

“ARTICLE 16

<u>Limitation on Benefits</u>

(1)        Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a resident of one of the Contracting States that derives income from the other Contracting State shall not be entitled to the benefits of this Convention otherwise accorded to residents of one of the Contracting States unless such resident is a “qualified person” as defined in paragraph (2).

(2)        A resident of one of the Contracting States shall be a qualified person for a taxable year if the resident is: 

(a)     an individual;

(3)        (a)     A resident of one of the Contracting States will be entitled to the benefits of the Convention with respect to an item of income derived from the other State, regardless of whether the resident is a qualified person, if the resident is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in the first-mentioned State (other than the business of making or managing investments for the resident’s own account, unless these activities are banking, insurance or securities activities carried on by a bank, insurance company or a registered, licensed or authorized securities dealer), and the income derived from the other Contracting State is derived in connection with, or is incidental to, that trade or business.

(b)     If the resident or any of its associated enterprises carries on a trade or business activity in the other Contracting State which gives rise to an item of income, sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph shall apply to such item only if the trade or business activity in the first-mentioned State is substantial in relation to the trade or business activity in the other State. Whether a trade or business activity is substantial for purposes of this paragraph will be determined based on all the facts and circumstances.

(c)     In determining whether a person is “engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business” in a Contracting State under sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, activities conducted by a partnership in which that person is a partner and activities conducted by persons connected to such person shall be deemed to be conducted by such person. A person shall be connected to another if one possesses at least 50 percent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 percent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) or another person possesses, directly or indirectly, at least 50 percent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 percent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) in each person. In any case, a person shall be considered to be connected to another if, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or persons.

(4)        Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, if a company that is a resident of one of the Contracting States, or a company that owns at least 50 percent of the aggregate vote or value of such a company, has outstanding a class of shares:

(a)     which is subject to terms or other arrangements which entitle its holders to a portion of the income of the company derived from the other Contracting State that is larger than the portion such holders would receive absent such terms or arrangements (“the disproportionate part of the income”); and 

(b)     50 percent or more of the voting power and value of which is owned by persons who are not qualified persons,

the benefits of this Convention shall not apply to the disproportionate part of the income.

(5)        A resident of one of the Contracting States that is not a qualified person pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article shall, nevertheless, be granted benefits of the Convention if the competent authority of the other Contracting State determines, in accordance with the law of that other State, that the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of such person and the conduct of its operations did not have as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of benefits under the Convention.

(6)        For purposes of this Article the term “recognized stock exchange” means:

(a)     the NASDAQ System owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and any stock exchange registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934;

     (b)  in so acting, he manufactures or processes in that State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise.

(7)   The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise) shall not of itself make either company a permanent establishment of the other.

CHAPTER III

**TAXATION OF INCOME**

ARTICLE 6

_Income from Real Property_

ARTICLE 7

_Business Profits_

(1)   The profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting  State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(5)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment of an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(6)   For the purposes of this Article, except as provided in the Articles referred to in this paragraph, the profits of an enterprise do not include items of income dealt with in Articles 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17 and paragraphs (3) and (4) of Article 21.

(7)   Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law of a Contracting State relating specifically to taxation of any person who carries on a business of any form of insurance, provided that if the law in force in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Convention is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

ARTICLE 8

_Shipping and Air Transport_

(1)   Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), such profits may be taxed in the other Contracting  State where they are profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that other State.

(3)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States through participation in a pool service, in a joint transport operating organisation or in an international operating agency.

(4)   For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise taken on board in a Contracting State for discharge at another place in that State shall be treated as profits from operations confined solely to places in that State.

ARTICLE 9

_Associated Enterprises_

(1)   Where—

     (a)  an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(3)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1) or (2), in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall, subject to paragraph (4), make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention in relation to the nature of the income, and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

(4)   The provisions of paragraph (3) relating to an appropriate adjustment are not applicable after the expiration of six years from the end of the year of income or taxation year in respect of which a Contracting State has charged to tax the profits to which the adjustment would relate.

ARTICLE 10

_Dividends_

(1)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such dividends may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

(3)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State. Provided that this paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of Canada for the purposes of Canadian tax.

(4)   The term “dividends” in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

(5)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State, or performs professional services from a fixed base situated in that other State, being the State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(6)   Canada may impose tax, on the earnings attributable to a permanent establishment in Canada of a company which is a resident of Australia, in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a resident of Canada; provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 15 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the profits attributable to a permanent establishment in Canada in a year and previous years, after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits in Canada.

(7)   Australia may impose an income tax (in this paragraph called a “branch profits tax”) on the reduced taxable income of a company that is a resident of Canada in addition to the income tax (in this paragraph called “the general income tax”) payable by the company in respect of its taxable income; provided that any branch profits tax so imposed in respect of a year of income shall not exceed 15 per cent of the amount by which the reduced taxable income of that year of income exceeds the general income tax payable in respect of the reduced taxable income of that year of income.

ARTICLE 11

_Interest_

(1)   Interest arising in one of the Contracting States, being interest to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such interest may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

(3)   The term “interest” in this Article includes interest from Government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, and interest from any other form of indebtedness as well as all other income assimilated to interest by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State, or performs professional services from a fixed base situated in that other State, being the State in which the interest arises, and the indebtedness giving rise to the interest is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a political sub--division or a local authority thereof or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in a State other than that of which he is a resident a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and that interest is borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest or between both of them and some other person the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Convention.

ARTICLE 12

_Royalties_

(1)   Royalties arising in one of the Contracting States, being royalties to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such royalties may be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

(3)   The term “royalties” in this Article means payments (including credits), whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right, or industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information, or for the supply of any assistance of an ancillary and subsidiary nature furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of such knowledge or information or any other property or right to which this Article applies and includes any payments to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, motion picture films, films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting, or for total or partial forbearance in respect of the use of a property or right referred to in this paragraph.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State, or performs professional services from a fixed base situated in that other State, being the State in which the royalties arise and the asset giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a political sub--division or a local authority thereof or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in a State other than that of which he is a resident a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and those royalties are borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Convention.

     (b)  the tax that would be payable in respect of the pension or annuity received in the year if the recipient were a resident of the Contracting State in which the pension or annuity arises.

Article 9

Associated Enterprises

1.         Where

_a)_      an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or

_b)_      the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2.         Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits accruing to an enterprise, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article.

3.         Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits.  In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

4.         No adjustments to the profits of an enterprise for a year of income shall be made by a Contracting State in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 after the expiration of 7 years from the date on which the enterprise has completed the tax filing requirements of that State for that year of income.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default or where, within that period of 7 years, an audit into the profits of an enterprise has been initiated by that State.

Article 10

Dividends

1.         Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State, being dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

2.         However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed:

_a_)      5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner of those dividends is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and

_b)_15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.

This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

3.         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned, directly or indirectly through one or more residents of either Contracting State, shares representing 80 per cent or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for a 12 month period ending on the date the dividend is declared and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends:

_a)_      has its principal class of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subsubparagraph 1 _l)(i)_ or _(ii)_ of Article 3 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges; 

_b)_      is owned directly or indirectly by one or more companies: 

_(i)_      whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subsubparagraph 1 _l)(i)_ or _(ii)_ of Article 3 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges; or

_(ii)_which, if that company or each of those companies owned directly the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid, would be entitled to equivalent benefits in respect of such dividends under a tax treaty between the State of which that company is a resident and the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident; or

_c)_       does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs _a)_ or _b)_ of this paragraph but the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State determines that the first sentence of paragraph 9 of this Article does not apply.  The competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State shall consult the competent authority of the other Contracting State before refusing to grant benefits of this Convention under this subparagraph.

4.         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends holds directly no more than 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends, and the beneficial owner is a Contracting State, or political subdivision or a local authority thereof (including a government investment fund).

5.         The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights participating in profits, as well as other amounts which are subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax**.**

6.         The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

7.         Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company—being dividends beneficially owned by a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State—except insofar as the holding in respect of which such dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.  

8.         Notwithstanding paragraph 7, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax may be taxed in a Contracting State to the extent that the dividends are paid out of profits or income arising in that State.  Where such dividends are beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall apply as if the company paying the dividends were a resident only of the first-mentioned State.

9.         No relief shall be available under this Article if it is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the dividends, or with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article.  In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State.

Article 11

Interest

1.         Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2.         However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

3.         Notwithstanding paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if:

_a)_      the interest is derived by a Contracting State or by a political sub-division or a local authority thereof (including a government investment fund), or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State; or

_b)_      the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer.  For the purposes of this Article, the term “financial institution” means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance.

4\.         Notwithstanding paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph _b)_ of that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if:

_a)_      in the case of interest arising in New Zealand, it is paid by a person that has not paid approved issuer levy in respect of the interest.  This subparagraph _a)_ shall not apply if New Zealand does not have an approved issuer levy, or the payer of the interest is not eligible to elect to pay the approved issuer levy, or if the rate of the approved issuer levy payable in respect of such interest exceeds two percent of the gross amount of the interest.  For the purposes of this Article, “approved issuer levy” includes any identical or substantially similar charge payable by the payer of interest arising in New Zealand enacted after the date of this Convention in place of approved issuer levy; or

_b)_      it is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans.

5.         The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10.

6.         The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, subparagraph _b)_ of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

7.         Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax.  Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside bothContracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

8.         Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

9.         No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the assignment of the interest, the creation or assignment of the debt-claim or other rights in respect of which the interest is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the person which is the beneficial owner of the interest or the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article.  In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State.

Article 12

Royalties

1.         Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2.         However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3.         The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for:

_a)_      the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; 

_b)_      the supply of information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific experience; 

_c)_       the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph _a)_ or any such information as is mentioned in subparagraph _b)_; 

_d)_      the use of, or the right to use:

_(i)_      motion picture films;

_e)_       the use of, or the right to use, some or all of the part of the radiofrequency spectrum as specified in a spectrum licence of a Contracting State, where the payment or credit arises in that State; or

_f)_       total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph.

4.         The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5.         Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax.  Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6.         Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such case, the excess part of the payments or credits shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

7.         No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the royalties, or with the creation or assignment of the rights in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited, to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.  In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State.

6.         Where an individual who upon ceasing to be a resident of a Contracting State, is treated under the taxation law of that State as having alienated any property and is taxed in that State by reason thereof, the individual may elect to be treated for the purposes of taxation in the other Contracting State as if the individual had, immediately before ceasing to be a resident of the first-mentioned State, alienated and reacquired the property for an amount equal to its fair market value at that time.

7.         The provisions of this Article shall not affect the right of Australia to tax, in accordance with its laws, income, profits or gains from the alienation of any property derived by a person who is a resident of Australia at any time during the year of income in which the property is alienated, or has been so resident at any time during the 6 years immediately preceding that year.

Article 24

Non-discrimination

1.         Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.  This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.

2.         The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances.

4.         Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected.

_a)_      is designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes;

Article 25

Mutual Agreement Procedure

1.         Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for the person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, the person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if the case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which the person is a national.  The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.

2.         The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention.  Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

3.         The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.  They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.

4.         The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

5.         For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States.  Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of this Article or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.

6.         Where,

_a)_      under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and

_b)_      the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the presentation of the case to the competent authority of the other Contracting State,

any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been reserved or rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State.  Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.

7.         The issues to which the provisions of paragraph 6 apply are:

_a)_      issues of fact; and

_b)_      issues which the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand agree, in an Exchange of Notes, shall be covered by the provisions of paragraph 6.

Article 26

Exchange of Information

1.         The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is forseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed, in the case of Australia, under the federal tax laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, and in the case of New Zealand, under its tax laws, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention.  The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.

2.         Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above.  Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes.  They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.

3.         In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

_a_)      to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; 

_b_)      to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

_c_)       to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).

4.         If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

5.         In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.

Article 27

Assistance in the Collection of Taxes

1.         The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims.  This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.

2.         The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description imposed, in the case of Australia, under the federal tax laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, and in the case of New Zealand, under its tax laws, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount.

3.         When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State.  That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.

4.         When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State.  That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection. 

5.         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such.  In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.

6.         Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State. 

7.         Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be

_a)_      in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or

_b)_      in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection

the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.

8.         In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

_a)_      to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

_b)_      to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public); 

_c)_       to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice; 

_d)_      to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State;

_e)_       to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles.

Article 28

Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts

            Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international agreements.

ARTICLE 5

1.    Profits of an Australian enterprise shall not be subject to Singapore tax unless the enterprise carries on trade or business in Singapore through a permanent establishment in Singapore. If it carries on trade or business as aforesaid, Singapore tax may be imposed on those profits but only on so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

2.    Profits of a Singapore enterprise shall not be subject to Australian tax unless the enterprise carries on trade or business in Australia through a permanent establishment in Australia. If it carries on trade or business as aforesaid, Australian tax may be imposed on those profits but only on so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

3.    Where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on trade or business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make in that other Contracting State if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with an independent enterprise; and the profits so attributed shall be deemed to be income derived from sources in that other Contracting State and shall be taxed accordingly.

4.    In determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States, there shall be allowed as deductions all expenses of the enterprise, including executive and general administrative expenses, which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent enterprise and which are reasonably allocable to the permanent establishment, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere, but where goods manufactured out of that Contracting State by the enterprise are imported into that Contracting State, and the goods are, either before or after importation, sold in that Contracting State by the enterprise, the profits of the enterprise taxable in that Contracting State may be determined by deducting from the sale price of the goods the amount for which, at the date the goods were shipped to that Contracting State, goods of the same nature and quality could be purchased by a wholesale buyer in the country of manufacture, and the expenses incurred in transporting them to and selling them in that Contracting State.

5.    If the information available to the competent authority of the Contracting State concerned is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that Contracting State in relation to the liability of the enterprise to pay tax, in respect of the permanent establishment, on an amount determined by the exercise of a discretion or the making of an estimate by the competent authority of that Contracting State. Provided that the discretion shall be exercised or the estimate shall be made, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles stated in this Article.

6.    Profits shall not be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase or mere purchase and transportation by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

7.    Nothing in this Article shall apply to either Contracting State to prevent the operation in the Contracting State of any provisions of its law relating specifically to the taxation of any person who carries on a business of any form of insurance or to the taxation of a non--resident who derives income under any contract or agreement with any person in relation to the carrying on in the Contracting State by that person of any form of film business controlled abroad. Provided that if the law in force in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Agreement relating to the taxation of such persons is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character), the Contracting Governments shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to such amendment of this paragraph as may be necessary.

ARTICLE 6

1.    Where—

(a)   an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State; or

(b)   the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and, in either case, conditions are operative between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between distinct and separate enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then, if by reason of those circumstances profits which might be expected to accrue to one of the enterprises do not accrue to that enterprise, there may be included in the profits of that enterprise the profits which might have been expected so to accrue to it if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities and its dealings with the other enterprise were dealings wholly independently with that enterprise or an independent enterprise.

2.    Profits included in the profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be deemed to be income of that enterprise derived from sources in that Contracting State and shall be taxed accordingly.

3.    If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine, for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, the profits which might have been expected to accrue to an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that Contracting State in relation to the liability of that enterprise to pay tax on an amount determined by the exercise of a discretion or the making of an estimate by the competent authority of that Contracting State. Provided that the discretion shall be exercised or the estimate shall be made, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles stated in this Article.

ARTICLE 7

1.    The tax payable in a Contracting State by a resident of the other Contracting State in respect of profits from the operation of ships, other than profits from voyages or operations of ships confined solely to places in the first--mentioned Contracting State, shall not exceed half the amount which would be payable in respect of those profits but for this paragraph.

2.    A resident of one of the Contracting States shall be exempt from tax in the other   Contracting State on profits from the operation of aircraft, other than profits from flights of aircraft confined solely to places in the other Contracting  State.

3.    The relief provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States through participation in a pool service, in a joint transport operating organisation or in an international operating agency but only to the extent to which the share of the profits is not attributable to profits from voyages, flights or operations confined solely to places in the other Contracting State.

4.    For the purpose of this Article profits derived from the carriage of passengers, livestock, mails or goods shipped in one of the Contracting States for discharge at another place in that Contracting State or, in the case of Australia, at a place in the Territory of Papua or the Trust Territory of New Guinea are profits from a voyage or flight of a ship or aircraft confined solely to places in that Contracting State.

ARTICLE 8

1.    The Australian tax on dividends, being dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia, derived by a Singapore resident who is beneficially entitled to the dividends, shall not exceed 15 per centum of the gross amount of the dividends.

_Note:       See section 3._

**Second Protocol amending the Agreement between the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Singapore for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income as amended by the Protocol of 16 October 1989.**

            The Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Singapore

            Have agreed as follows:

ARTICLE I

            Article 19 of the Agreement is omitted and the following Article is substituted:

“ARTICLE 19

1.         The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1A and 1.

2.         Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

3.         In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

a)         to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

4.         If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

5.         In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.”

ARTICLE II

            The Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Singapore shall notify each other through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their respective internal procedures required for the bringing into force of this Protocol which shall form an integral part of the Agreement.

<u> </u>

_(i)_         derived from a Contracting State through an entity that is organised in a state other than the Contracting States; and

_(ii)_        treated as the income, profits or gains of the beneficiaries, members or participants of that entity under the tax law of the other Contracting State,

shall be eligible for the benefits of the Convention that would be granted if it were directly derived by a beneficiary, member or participant of that entity who is a resident of that other Contracting State, to the extent that such beneficiaries, members or participants are residents of that other Contracting State and satisfy any other conditions specified in the Convention, without regard to whether the income, profits or gains are treated as the income, profits or gains of such beneficiaries, members or participants under the tax law of the first-mentioned Contracting State or such state.

_d)_                an item of income, profits or gains:

_(ii)_        the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the enterprises.

<u> </u>

6.           Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Article, an enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment merely by reason of:

_b)_ the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;

_c)_ the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;

_d)_ the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; or

_e)_ the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

7.           Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person—other than an agent of an independent status to whom the provisions of paragraph 8 apply—is acting on behalf of an enterprise and:

8.           An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that Contracting State through a person who is a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that the person is acting in the ordinary course of the person’s business as such a broker or agent.

9.           The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other Contracting State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.

10.          The principles set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall be applied in determining for the purposes of paragraph 7 of Article 11 and paragraph 5 of Article 12 whether there is a permanent establishment in a state other than the Contracting States, and whether an enterprise, not being an enterprise of either of the Contracting States, has a permanent establishment in a Contracting State.

**Article 6**

**Article 7**

**BUSINESS PROFITS**

1.           The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that Contracting State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein.  If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in that other Contracting State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

2.           Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

3.           In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent enterprise which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

4.           Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that, on the basis of the available information, the determination of the profits of the permanent establishment is consistent with the principles stated in this Article.

5.           No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

6.           For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

7.           Where profits include items of income or gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

8.           Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to tax imposed on profits from insurance with a person other than a resident of that Contracting State.

<u> </u>

9.           Where:

_a)_              a resident of a Contracting State is beneficially entitled, whether directly or through one or more interposed trusts, to a share of the profits derived from business carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust (other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes) in its capacity as trustee; and

<u> </u>

_b)_              in relation to the carrying on of the business, that trustee, in accordance with the principles stated in Article 5, has a permanent establishment in that other Contracting State,

the business carried on by the trustee shall be deemed to be a business carried on in that other Contracting State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the share of the profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment.

**Article 8**

**SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT**

1.           Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.

2.           Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, provided that no political subdivision or local authority of Australia levies a tax similar to the local inhabitant taxes or the enterprise tax in Japan in respect of the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic carried on by an enterprise of Japan, an enterprise of Australia shall be exempt from the local inhabitant taxes and the enterprise tax in Japan in respect of the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.

3.           Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft may be taxed in the other Contracting State to the extent that they are profits derived directly or indirectly from the operation of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that other Contracting State.

4.           For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that Contracting State shall be treated as profits from the operation of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that Contracting State.

<u> </u>

5.           The provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall also apply to profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived through participation in a pool service, joint business or other profit sharing arrangement.

**Article 9**

**ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES**

1.           Where:

_a)_                an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or

_b)_                the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2.           Nothing in this Article, other than paragraph 4, shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits accruing to an enterprise, provided that, on the basis of the available information, the determination of that tax liability of the enterprise is consistent with the principles stated in paragraph 1.

<u> </u>

3.           Where a Contracting State includes, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 or 2, in the profits of an enterprise of that Contracting State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other Contracting State and where the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree, upon consultation, that all or part of the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned Contracting State if the conditions operative between the two enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the other Contracting State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those agreed profits.  In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention.

<u> </u>

4.           Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, a Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise of that Contracting State in the circumstances referred to in those paragraphs, if an enquiry into the profits of that enterprise is not initiated within seven years from the end of the taxable year in which the profits that would be subject to such change, but for the conditions referred to in those paragraphs, might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default or if the inability to initiate an enquiry within the prescribed period is attributable to the actions or inaction of that enterprise.

**Article 10**

**DIVIDENDS**

1.           Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of its tax, being dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other Contracting State.

2.           However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax and according to the law of that Contracting State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed:

_a)_ 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company which owns directly shares representing at least 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends;

_b)_ 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.

3.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State and that has owned directly shares representing at least 80 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for the 12 month period ending on the date on which entitlement to the dividends is determined and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends:

_a)_                is a qualified person by reason of the provisions of subparagraph _c)_ of paragraph 2 of Article 23;

_b)_          has at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of its shares owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer companies referred to in subparagraph _a)_; or

_c)_                is granted benefits with respect to those dividends under paragraph 5 of Article 23.

4.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, dividends paid by a company that is a resident of Japan and that is entitled to a deduction for dividends paid to its beneficiaries in computing its taxable income in Japan, being dividends beneficially owned by a resident of Australia, may also be taxed in Japan according to the law of Japan, but the tax so charged shall not exceed:

_a)_      15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if more than 50 percent of the assets of such company consist, directly or indirectly, of real property situated in Japan;

_b)_      10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.

5.    The provisions of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

6.    The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income or other distributions which are subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax.

7._a)_      Distributions of income, profits or gains by a Real Estate Investment Trust (hereinafter referred to as a “REIT”), being distributions beneficially owned by a resident of Japan, may be taxed in Japan.

_b)_                However, such distributions may also be taxed in Australia according to the law of Australia, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the distributions if the beneficial owner of the distributions is a resident of Japan other than a beneficial owner of the distributions which holds, or has held at any time in the 12 month period preceding the date on which the distributions are made, directly or indirectly, capital that represents at least 10 percent of the value of all the capital in the REIT.

_c)_                For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “Real Estate Investment Trust” means a managed investment trust created or organised under the laws of Australia which carries on a business consisting of investment, directly or indirectly, in real property for the main purpose of deriving rent.

8.    The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends or distributions, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax (or, in the case of a REIT to which paragraph 7 applies, in Australia) through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends or distributions are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

<u> </u>

9.    Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other Contracting State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company — being dividends beneficially owned by a person who is not a resident of that other Contracting State — except insofar as the holding in respect of which such dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other Contracting State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other Contracting State. However, in the case of dividends paid by a company which is deemed to be a resident only of a Contracting State by reason of the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 4, the other Contracting State may tax such dividends to the extent that they are paid out of profits or income arising in that other Contracting State and, in the case of dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State, according to the provisions of paragraphs 2 or 3.

10.   A resident of a Contracting State shall not be considered the beneficial owner of the dividends paid by a resident of the other Contracting State for the purposes of its tax in respect of preferred shares or other similar interests if such preferred shares or other similar interests might not have been expected to have been established or acquired unless a person:

_a)_                that is not entitled to benefits with respect to dividends paid by a resident of that other Contracting State which are equivalent to, or more favourable than, those available under this Convention to a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State; and

_b)_                that is not a resident of either Contracting  State,

owned equivalent preferred shares or other similar interests in the first-mentioned resident.

11.   No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the assignment of the dividends or distributions, the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividends or distributions are paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company which is the beneficial owner of the dividends or distributions or the conduct of its operations to take advantage of this Article.

**Article 11**

**INTEREST**

1.           Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State.

<u> </u>

2.           However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the law of that Contracting State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

3.           Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall not be taxed in the first-mentioned Contracting State if:

_a)_                the interest is derived by a Contracting  State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof, by any other body exercising governmental functions in a Contracting State, or by the Bank of Japan or the Reserve Bank of Australia;

_b)_                the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer.  For the purpose of this Article, the term “financial institution” means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or taking deposits at interest and by using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance; or

<u> </u>

4.           Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph _b)_ of that paragraph may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if the interest is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to an arrangement involving back-to-back loans.

<u> </u>

5.           The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, interest from government securities and interest from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, and all other income that is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the tax law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.  Income dealt with in Article 10 shall not be regarded as interest for the purposes of this Convention.

<u> </u>

6.           The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, subparagraph _b)_ of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claims or other rights in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

<u> </u>

7.           Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that Contracting State for the purposes of its tax.  Where, however, the person paying interest, whether such person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or a state other than the Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid were incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then:

_a)_                if the permanent establishment is situated in a Contracting State, such interest shall be deemed to arise in that   Contracting State; and

_b)_                if the permanent establishment is situated in a state other than the Contracting States, such interest shall not be deemed to arise in either Contracting State.

8.           Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claims or other rights for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

<u> </u>

9.           A resident of a Contracting State shall not be considered the beneficial owner of the interest arising in the other Contracting State in respect of a debt-claim or other right if such debt-claim or other right might not have been expected to have been established unless a person:

_a)_                that is not entitled to benefits with respect to the interest arising in that other Contracting State which are equivalent to, or more favourable than, those available under this Convention to a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State; and

_b)_                that is not a resident of either Contracting  State,

owned an equivalent debt-claim or other right against the first-mentioned resident.

<u> </u>

10.          No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the assignment of the interest, the creation or assignment of the debt-claim or other rights in respect of which the interest is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company which is the beneficial owner of the interest or the conduct of its operations to take advantage of this Article.

_d)_                the use of, or the right to use:

_e)_                total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph.

4.           The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the property or right in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5.           Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that Contracting State for the purposes of its tax.  Where, however, the person paying royalties, whether such person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or a state other than the Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay or credit the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then:

_a)_                if the permanent establishment is situated in a Contracting State, such royalties shall be deemed to arise in that Contracting State; and

_b)_                if the permanent establishment is situated in a state other than the Contracting States, such royalties shall not be deemed to arise in either Contracting State.

6.           Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such case, the excess part of the payments or credits shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

<u> </u>

7.           A resident of a Contracting State shall not be considered the beneficial owner of the royalties arising in the other Contracting State in respect of the use of the property or right if such royalties might not have been expected to have been paid to the resident unless the resident paid royalties in respect of the same property or right to a person:

_a)_ that is not entitled to benefits with respect to royalties arising in that other Contracting State which are equivalent to, or more favourable than, those available under this Convention to a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State; and

_b)_                that is not a resident of either Contracting  State.

8.           No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the assignment of the royalties, the creation or assignment of the property or right in respect of which the royalties are paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company which is the beneficial owner of the royalties or the conduct of its operations to take advantage of this Article.

_c)_                In determining whether a person is carrying on business in a Contracting State under subparagraph _a)_ of this paragraph, the business conducted by a partnership in which that person is a partner and the business conducted by persons connected to such person shall be deemed to be conducted by such person.  A person shall be connected to another if one possesses, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interests in the other (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the shares of the company) or another person possesses, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interests (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the shares of the company) in each person.  In any case, a person shall be considered to be connected to another if, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or persons.

<u> </u>

<u> </u>

**Article 24**

**LIMITATION OF RELIEF**

1.           Where under this Convention any income, profits or gains are relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the law in force in the other Contracting State, an individual, in respect of that income or those profits or gains, is taxed by reference to the amount thereof that is remitted to or received in that other Contracting State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the relief to be allowed under the Convention in the first-mentioned Contracting State shall apply only to so much of that income or those profits or gains as is taxed in the other Contracting State.

2.           Where under this Convention any income, profits or gains are relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the law in force in the other Contracting State, an individual, in respect of that income or those profits or gains, is exempt from tax by virtue of being a temporary resident of that other Contracting State within the meaning of the applicable law of that other Contracting State, then the relief to be allowed under the Convention in the first-mentioned Contracting State shall not apply to the extent that that income or those profits or gains are exempt from tax in the other Contracting State.

**ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION**

1.           Subject to the provisions of the laws of Japan regarding the allowance as a credit against Japanese tax of tax payable in any country other than Japan:

_a)_                Where a resident of Japan derives income from Australia which may be taxed in Australia in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, the amount of Australian tax payable in respect of that income shall be allowed as a credit against the Japanese tax imposed on that resident.  The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed that part of the Japanese tax which is appropriate to that income.

_b)_                Where the income derived from Australia is dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia to a company which is a resident of Japan and which has owned at least 10 per cent either of the voting shares or of the total issued shares of the company paying the dividends during the period of six months immediately before the day when the obligation to pay dividends is confirmed, the credit shall take into account Australian tax payable by the company paying the dividends in respect of its income.

2.           Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Japanese tax paid under the law of Japan and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income, profits or gains derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in Japan shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income, profits or gains.

**Article 26**

**NON-DISCRIMINATION**

1.           Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other Contracting State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.  The provisions of this paragraph shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.

2.           The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other Contracting State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other Contracting State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to individuals who are residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes which it grants to its own residents.

3.           Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 8 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State.

4.           Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned Contracting State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected.

5.           The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description imposed by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof.

**Article 27**

**MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE**

1.           Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for the person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, the person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those Contracting States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if the case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 26, to that of the Contracting State of which the person is a national.  The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.

2.           The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.  Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

3.           The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention.  They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.

4.           The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs of this Article.

5.           For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding the provisions of that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States.  Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of this Article or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.

**Article 28**

**EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION**

1.           The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic law concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention.  The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.

2.           Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic law of that Contracting State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above.  Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes.  They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

3.           In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

_a)_                to carry out administrative measures at variance with the law and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

_b)_                to supply information which is not obtainable under the law or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

_c)_                to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.

4.           If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other Contracting State may not need such information for its own tax purposes.  The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

5.           In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.

**Article 29**

**MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS**

**AND CONSULAR POSTS**

Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international agreements.

<u> </u>

15.          With reference to paragraph 4 of Article 11 (Interest) of the Convention:

It is understood that the term “arrangement involving back-to-back loans” would cover, _inter alia_, any kind of arrangement structured in such a way that a financial institution which is a resident of a Contracting State receives interest arising in the other Contracting State and the financial institution pays an equivalent interest to another person who is a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State and, if it received the interest directly from the other Contracting State, would not be entitled to the exemption from tax with respect to that interest in that other Contracting State.

(6)   The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself make either company a permanent establishment of the other.

If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. In the determination of such profits there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(3)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(4)   For the purposes of this Article, except as provided in the Articles referred to in this paragraph, the profits of an enterprise do not include income or profits dealt with in Articles 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16.

<u>ARTICLE 8</u>

(1)   A resident of a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting  State on profits from the operation of ships or aircraft.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), a resident of a Contracting State may be taxed in the other Contracting State on profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that other State.

(3)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of a Contracting State through participation in a pool service, in a joint transport operating organisation or in an international operating agency.

(4)   For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mails, goods or merchandise shipped in a Contracting State for discharge at another place in that State or, in the case of Australia, at a place in the Territory of Papua or the Trust Territory of New Guinea are profits from operations confined solely to places in that State.

(5)   The amount which shall be charged to tax in a Contracting State as profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in respect of which a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first--mentioned State under paragraph (2) or (3) shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount paid or payable (net of rebates) in respect of carriage in such operations.

(6)   Paragraph (5) shall not apply to profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft by a resident of a Contracting State whose principal place of business is in the the other Contracting State, nor shall it apply to profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft by a resident of a Contracting State if those profits are derived otherwise than from the carriage of passengers, livestock, mails, goods or merchandise. In such cases, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply but there shall be excluded from the profits on which any such person is charged to Australian tax any amount of profits taxed in the Territory of Papua or the Trust Territory of New Guinea.

<u>ARTICLE 9</u>

Where—

     (a)  an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting  State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions are operative between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

ARTICLE 10

(1)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia for purposes of Australian tax to a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany may be taxed in Australia, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

(2)   Dividends paid by a company which is subject to unlimited tax liability in the Federal Republic of Germany to a resident of Australia may be taxed in the Federal Republic of Germany, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

(3)   The term ‘dividends’ in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident, and shall include, in the case of paragraph (2), the income of a sleeping partner (stiller Gesellschafter) from his participation as such.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the recipient of the dividends has in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident a permanent establishment with which the holding by virtue of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

<u>ARTICLE 11</u>

(1)   Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first--mentioned State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

(2)   The term ‘interest’  in this Article includes interest from Government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, and interest from any other form of indebtedness as well as all other income assimilated to interest by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

(3)   The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply if the recipient of the interest has in the Contracting State in which the interest arises a permanent establishment with which the indebtedness from which the interest arises is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

(4)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a State or a Land of that Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority of that Contracting State or a person who is a resident of that Contracting State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a State other than that of which he is a resident a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and the interest is borne by the permanent establishment, then the interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

(5)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

<u>ARTICLE 12</u>

(1)   Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first--mentioned State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

(2)   The term ‘royalties’ in this Article means payments, whether periodical or not, and however described and computed, to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trade--mark, or other like property or right, or industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information, or for the supply of any assistance connected with the supply of such knowledge or information, and includes any payments to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, motion picture films, films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting.

(3)   The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply if the recipient of the royalties has in the Contracting State in which the royalties arise a permanent establishment with which the asset giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

(4)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a State or a Land of that Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority of that Contracting State or a person who is a resident of that Contracting State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a State other than that of which he is a resident a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

(5)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting  State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other independent activities of a similar character shall be taxable only in that State unless he has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities. If he has such a fixed base, the income may be taxed in the other State but only so much of it as is attributable to that fixed base.

<u>ARTICLE 14</u>

(1)   Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17, 18 and 19, remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived from that exercise may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall, if—

     (a)  the period, or the aggregate of the periods, for which the recipient is present in the other State in the year of income or the assessment period, as the case may be, of the other State during which the employment is exercised does not exceed 183 days;

     (b)  the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and

     (c)  the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State,

be taxable only in the first--mentioned State.

Directors’ fees and similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

<u>ARTICLE 16</u>

(1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 13 and 14, income derived by public entertainers (such as theatrical, motion picture, radio or television artists and musicians and athletes) from their personal activities as such may be taxed in the Contracting  State in which these activities are exercised.

(2)   Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, where the services of a public entertainer mentioned in paragraph (1) are provided in a Contracting State by an enterprise of the other Contracting State, the profits derived by that enterprise from providing those services may be taxed in the first--mentioned State if the public entertainer performing the services controls, directly or indirectly, that enterprise.

<u>ARTICLE 17</u>

(1)   Remuneration (other than a pension or annuity) paid by the Commonwealth of Australia, a State of the Commonwealth or a political subdivision or local authority of the Commonwealth or of a State to any individual in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in Australia. If, however, the employment is exercised in the Federal Republic of Germany by an individual who is a German citizen or is subject to unlimited tax liability in the Federal Republic of Germany such remuneration shall be taxable only in the Federal Republic of Germany.

(2)   Remuneration (other than a pension or annuity) paid by the Federal Republic of Germany, a Land or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to any individual in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in the Federal Republic of Germany. If, however, the employment is exercised in Australia by an individual who is an Australian citizen or is ordinarily resident in Australia such remuneration shall be taxable only in Australia.

(3)   This Article shall not apply to remuneration in respect of an employment exercised in connection with any trade or business carried on by a Government, a political subdivision or an authority referred to in paragraphs (1) or (2).

(2)   Payments which a student who is, or immediately before was, a resident of a Contracting State and who is temporarily present in the other Contracting State solely for the purpose of his education receives from sources outside that other State for the purposes of his maintenance or education shall not be taxed in that other State.

<u>ARTICLE 20</u>

Where a person, who by reason of the provisions of paragraph (1)of Article 4 is a resident of both Contracting States but by reason of the provisions of paragraphs (2) or (3) of Article 4 is deemed for the purposes of this Agreement to be a resident solely of one of the Contracting State, derives income—

that income shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.

In the determination of its rate of tax applicable to any item of income or capital not so excluded, the Federal Republic of Germany will, however, take into account the items of income and capital so excluded. The first sentence of this sub--paragraph shall, in the case of income from dividends, apply only to such dividends as are paid to a company which is a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany by a company which is a resident of Australia of which at least 25 per cent of the voting shares or of the total shares issued are owned by the German company. There shall also be excluded from the basis upon which German tax is imposed any shareholding, the dividends on which it paid would be excluded from the basis upon which tax is imposed according to the immediately foregoing sentence.

     (b)  Subject to the provisions of German tax law regulating credit for foreign tax, there shall be allowed as a credit against German tax on income payable in respect of the following items of income the Australian tax paid in accordance with this Agreement on those items of income, namely—

                (i)     dividends to which sub--paragraph (a) does not apply;

              (vi)     profits to which paragraph (2) of Article 16 applies;

             (vii)     any item of income not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement.

<u>ARTICLE 23</u>

(1)   Where a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident.

(2)   The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

(3)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall together endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement.

(4)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

(2)   In no case shall the provisions of paragraph (1) be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation—

     (a)  to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (b)  to supply particulars which are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (c)  to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or to supply information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.

<u>ARTICLE 25</u>

(1)   Nothing in this Agreement shall affect diplomatic or consular privileges under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international agreements.

(2)   Insofar as, due to such privileges granted to a person under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international agreements, income or capital is not subject to tax in the receiving State, the right to tax shall be reserved to the sending State.

<u>ARTICLE 26</u>

This Agreement shall also apply to Land Berlin, provided that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has not made a contrary declaration to the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia within three months from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

<u>PROTOCOL</u>

THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA AND THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY

HAVE AGREED AT THE SIGNING of the Agreement between the two States for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital and to certain other taxes upon the following provisions which shall form an integral part of the said Agreement.

(1)   With reference to Article 5,

an enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishement if it carries on supervisory activities in that State for more than six months in connection with a building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project which is being undertaken in that State.

(2)   With reference to Article 6,

income from real property shall be taken to include income from leases of land.

(3)   With reference to Articles 6 to 8 and 10 to 16,

income derived by a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany which, under Articles 6 to 8 and 10 to 16 of the Agreement, may be taxed in Australia may be deemed, for the purposes of the Commonwealth income tax law, to be income from sources in Australia.

(4)   With reference to Article 7,

     (a)  insofar as it is customary in a Contracting State, in determining the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, to do so on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, that method may be adopted for the purpose of the application of Article 7 of the Agreement, provided that it shall be applied in such a way that the result accords with the principles stated in that Article.

     (b)  Article 7 of the Agreement shall not apply to profits of an enterprise from carrying on a business of any form of insurance, other than life insurance.

(5)   With reference to Articles 7 and 9,

where the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits of an enterprise on which tax may be imposed in that State in accordance with Article 7 or Article 9 of the Agreement, nothing in those Articles shall prevent the application to that enterprise of any law of that State making provision for determining the tax liability of an enterprise in special circumstances, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles applicable under Articles 7 and 9.

(6)   With reference to Article 10,

notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 10 of the Agreement German tax on dividends to which that paragraph applies paid to a company which is a resident of Australia by a company which is a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany, at least 25 per cent of the capital of which is held directly or indirectly by the Australian company itself, or by it together with other persons controlling it or being under common control with it, may be charged at a rate not exceeding 25.75 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the rate of German corporation tax on distributed profits is lower than that on undistributed profits and the difference between those two rates is 20 percentage points or more.

(7)   With reference to Articles 10 to 12,

the references in Articles 10 to 12 of the Agreement to dividends, interest or royalties paid to a resident of a Contracting State refer to dividends, interest or royalties to which a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany is beneficially entitled, and to dividends, interest or royalties to which a resident of Australia is entitled (bezugsberechtigt), being economically the owner (wirtschaftlicher Eigentumer) of the assets on which the dividends, interest or royalties are paid, as the case may be.

(8)   With reference to Articles 10 to 12 and 22,

for the purposes of Articles 10 to 12 and of paragraph (1) and sub--paragraph (b) of paragraph (2) of Article 22 of the Agreement the term ‘tax’ does not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest relating to the taxes to which the Agreement applies, imposed under the law in force in Australia or in the Federal Republic of Germany.

(9)   With reference to Article 11,

interest derived by the Government of a Contracting State, or by any other body exercising governmental functions in, or in a part of, a Contracting State, or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State, shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting State.

(10) With reference to Article 22,

     (a)  where income derived by a resident of a Contracting State may, under the provisions of Articles 6 to 8 and 10 to 16 of the Agreement, be taxed, even at a limited rate, in the other Contracting State, such income shall for the purposes of Article 22 of the Agreement be considered to be income from sources in that other State;

     (b)  for the purposes of paragraph (1) of Article 22 of the Agreement the term ‘German tax’ shall include German trade tax only where it is levied on a basis other than capital or pay--roll;

     (c)  for the purposes of sub--paragraph (a) of paragraph (2) of Article 22 of the Agreement, the term ‘Australia’ does not, in relation to an item of income derived by a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany from sources in a Territory or area referred to in sub--paragraph (a) (i) to (vi) of paragraph (1) of Article 3, include that area if Australian tax does not apply in relation to such income;

     (d)  sub--paragraph (a) of paragraph (2) of Article 22 of the Agreement shall apply to the profits of a permanent establishment or to dividends paid by a company only if the profits of the permanent establishement or the income of the company are derived exclusively or almost exclusively—

                (i)     from producing, manufacturing or processing goods or from similar activities, the exploration for or exploitation or treatment of minerals, quarrying, primary production, building, construction or assembly, transport, storage or communication, giving advice or rendering services, leasing or renting, banking, hire--purchase or money--lending or insurance, within Australia, selling goods or merchandise within or from Australia, or such other activities as may be agreed by the Contracting States in Letters to be exchanged for this purpose; or

               (ii)     from dividends paid by one or more companies, being residents of Australia, of which at least 25 per cent of the voting shares or of the total shares issued are owned by the first--mentioned company, which themselves derive their income exclusively or almost exclusively from the activities referred to in (i).

If these conditions are not met, subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of Article 22 of the Agreement shall extend to and shall apply both to the income and capital concerned;

     (e)  where, as long as German trade tax is levied on income, Australian tax paid in accordance with the Agreement on dividends, interest or royalties derived from Australia exceeds the corresponding German income or corporation tax against which credit is to be given by virtue of sub--paragraph (b) of paragraph (2) of Article 22 of the Agreement, there shall be deducted from such income, when computing the basis of the trade tax, such part of that income as corresponds to the ratio between the excess amount of Australian tax and the total amount of Australian tax, paid in accordance with the Agreement.

(11) General

     (a)  in the event that Australia should cease to allow a company which is a resident of Australia a rebate in its assessment at the average rate of tax payable by the company in respect of dividends derived from sources in the Federal Republic of Germany and included in the taxable income of the company, the Commonwealth of Australia will immediately advise the Federal Republic of Germany of the change and enter into negotiations with the Federal Republic of Germany in order to establish new provisions concerning the credit to be allowed by Australia against its tax on the dividends;

     (b)  in the event that the Federal Republic of Germany, in relation to dividends received by one company from another company, should reduce in its corporation tax law or in an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation with another country the percentage shareholding entitling the receiving company to relief from German corporation tax, the Federal Republic of Germany will immediately advise the Commonwealth of Australia of the reduction and enter into negotiations with the Commonwealth in order to introduce such lower percentage test into the Agreement;

     (c)  unless the context of the Agreement and of this Protocol otherwise requires, words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular.

DONE at Melbourne on the twenty--fourth day of November 1972, in four originals, two in the English language and two in the German language, all texts being equally authentic.

(7)   The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise) shall not of itself make either company a permanent establishment of the other.

(8)   The principles set forth in paragraphs (1) to (7) inclusive shall be applied in determining for the purposes of this Agreement whether there is a permanent establishment outside both States, and whether an enterprise, not being an enterprise of one of the States, has a permanent establishment in one of the States.

CHAPTER III

TAXATION OF INCOME

ARTICLE 6

Income from debt--claims of every kind, excluding bonds or debentures, secured by mortgage of real property or of any other direct interest in or over land, shall also be regarded as income from real property.

ARTICLE 7

_Business Profits_

(1)   The profits of an enterprise of one of the States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of one of the States carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(5)   For the purposes of this Article, except as provided in the Articles referred to in this paragraph, the profits of an enterprise do not include items of income dealt with in Articles 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17.

ARTICLE 8

_Shipping and Air Transport_

(1)   Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the States shall be taxable only in that State.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), such profits may be taxed in the other State where they are profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that other State.

(3)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of a State through participation in a pool service, in a joint transport operating organisation or in an international operating agency.

(4)   For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise shipped in a State for discharge at another place in that State shall be treated as profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that State.

(5)   The amount which shall be charged to tax in one of the States as profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in respect of which a resident of the other State may be taxed in the first--mentioned State under paragraph (2) or (3) shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount paid or payable (net of rebates) in respect of carriage in such operations.

(6)   Paragraph (5) shall not apply to profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft by a resident of one of the States whose principal place of business is in the other State, nor shall it apply to profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft by a resident of a State if those profits are derived otherwise than from the carriage of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise.

(1)   Where—

     (a)  an enterprise of one of the States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the States and an enterprise of the other State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1), in the profits of an enterprise of the other State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to the enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement in relation to the nature of the income, and for this purpose the competent authorities of the States shall if necessary consult each other.

The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

(3)   The term “dividends” in this Article means—

     (b)  in the case of the Netherlands, income which is subject to dividend tax.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

(5)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State.

(3)   The term “interest” in this Article includes interest from Government securities, or from bonds or debentures, and interest from any other form of indebtedness as well as all the income assimilated to interest by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises. The term does not include income to which Article 6 or Article 10 applies.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the other State, being the State in which the interest arises, and the indebtedness giving rise to the interest is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

(5)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a State when the payer is that State itself or a political sub--division of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State. Where, however—

     (a)  the person paying the interest is a resident of one of the States and has in the other State or outside both States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and the interest is borne by the permanent establishment, then the interest shall be deemed to arise where the permanent establishment is situated;

     (b)  the person paying the interest is not a resident of either of the States but has in one of the States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and the interest is borne by the permanent establishment, then the interest shall be deemed to arise where the permanent establishment is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each of the States, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

(3)   The term “royalties” in this Article means payments, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trade--mark, or other like property or right, or industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information, or for the supply of any assistance of an ancillary and subsidiary nature furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of such knowledge or information or any other property or right to which this Article applies, and includes any payments to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, motion picture films, films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the States, carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the other State, being the State in which the royalties arise, and the asset giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a State when the payer is that State itself or a political sub--division of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State. Where, however—

     (a)  the person paying the royalties is a resident of one of the States and has in the other State or outside both States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise where the permanent establishment is situated;

     (b)  the person paying the royalties is not a resident of either of the States but has in one of the States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise where the permanent establishment is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each of the States, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

(2)   In no case shall the provisions of paragraph (1) be construed so as to impose on a State the obligation—

PROTOCOL

THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS

HAVE AGREED AT THE SIGNING of the Agreement between the two States for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income upon the following provisions which shall form an integral part of the said Agreement.

(1)   With reference to Articles 6 to 8 and 10 to 17,

            income derived by a resident of the Netherlands which under those Articles may be taxed in Australia, shall for the purposes of the income tax law of Australia be deemed to be income from sources in Australia.

(2)   With reference to Articles 7 and 9,

            where the information available to the competent authority of a State is inadequate to determine the profits of an enterprise on which tax may be imposed in that State in accordance with Article 7 or Article 9, nothing in those Articles shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of those Articles.

(3)   With reference to Articles 7 and 23,

            profits of an enterprise of one of the States from carrying on a business of any form of insurance other than life insurance may be taxed in the other State in accordance with the law of that other State relating specifically to the taxation of any person who carries on such business, and Article 23 shall apply for the elimination of double taxation as if the profits so taxed were attributable to a permanent establishment of the enterprise in the State imposing the tax.

(4)   With reference to Articles 10, 11 and 12,

            applications for the restitution of tax levied by the Netherlands contrary to the provisions of those Articles must be lodged with the competent authority of the Netherlands within a period of three years after the expiration of the calendar year in which the tax has been levied.

(5)   With reference to Article 23,

     (a)  where income derived by a resident of Australia may, under the provisions of Articles 6 to 8 and 10 to 17, be taxed in the Netherlands such income shall, for the purposes of paragraph (1) of Article 23 and of the provisions of the income tax law of Australia dealing with the avoidance of double taxation, be deemed to be income from sources in the Netherlands;

     (b)  in so far as the Netherlands income tax or company tax is concerned, the basis mentioned in paragraph (2) of Article 23 is the “onzuivere inkomen” or “winst” in terms of the Netherlands income tax law or company tax law, respectively.

(6)   General.

_a)_      it has a building site or construction, installation or assembly project in that State which exists for more than twelve months; or

5.         The provisions of paragraphs 1, 3 and 7 shall also apply to income from real property of an enterprise.

_Article 7_

BUSINESS PROFITS

1.         The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

2.         Where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

3.         In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, including executive and general administrative expenses, which are deductible according to the law of the State in which the permanent establishment is situated whether incurred in that State or elsewhere.

4.         If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment of an enterprise, the competent authority may apply to that enterprise for that purpose the provisions of the taxation law of that State, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

5.         No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

6.         Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

7.         Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from carrying on a business of any form of insurance other than life insurance may be taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with the law of that other State relating specifically to the taxation of any person who carries on such a business, provided that if the law in force in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Convention relating to the taxation of such a person is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character), the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to such amendment of this paragraph as may be necessary.

8.         Where:

_a)_      a resident of a Contracting State is beneficially entitled, whether directly or through one or more interposed trust estates, to a share of the business profits of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust estate other than a trust estate which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and

_b)_      in relation to that enterprise, that trustee would, in accordance with the principles of Article 5, have a permanent establishment in that other State,

the enterprise carried on by the trustee shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and that share of business profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment.

_Article 8_

SHIPs and aircraft

1.         Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.

2.         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft may be taxed in the other Contracting State to the extent that they are profits derived directly or indirectly from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that other State.

3.         The amount which shall be charged to tax in a Contracting State under paragraph 2 in respect of transport operations of ships shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount paid or payable (net of rebates) in respect of carriage.

4.         The provisions of paragraph 3 shall not apply to profits from the operation of ships, where the profits are attributable to a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in the other Contracting State.

5.         The profits to which the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 apply include profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived through participation in a pool service or other profit sharing arrangement.

6.         For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that State (without having been discharged outside that State) shall be treated as profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that State.

_Article 9_

ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES

1.      Where:

_a)_      an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or

_b)_      the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions exist between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which may be expected between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which might, but for those conditions, be expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2.         If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, the competent authority may apply to that enterprise for that purpose the provisions of the taxation law of that State, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

3.         Where, according to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, profits are included by a Contracting State in the profits of an enterprise, the other Contracting State shall, on a claim being made by the other enterprise concerned, consistently with its law consider the inclusion so made and the provision of relief to that other enterprise in relation to the taxation of profits which the other State determines to be profits which, but for the particular conditions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, might have been expected to accrue to the first-mentioned enterprise.

_A__rticle 10_

DIVIDENDS

1.         Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of its tax, being dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2.         However, those dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed:

_a)_      0 per cent where those dividends are paid out of profits that have borne the normal rate of company tax and those dividends are paid to a company which, in the case of Australia, holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends, or in the case of France, holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends; and

_b)_      5 per cent of the gross amount of other dividends, if the beneficial owner of those dividends is a company which, in the case of Australia, holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends, or in the case of France, holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends; and 

_c)_       15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases,

provided that if the relevant law in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Convention is varied otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character, the Contracting States shall consult each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

3.         The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as other amounts which are subjected to the same taxation treatment as a distribution or dividend by the law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax.

4.         The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated in that other State, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5.         Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company—being dividends beneficially owned by a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State—except insofar as the holding in respect of which such dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, even if the dividends paid consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. This paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of France for the purposes of French tax.

_Article 11_

INTEREST

1.         Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2.         However, that interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

3.         Notwithstanding paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if:

_a)_      the interest is derived from the investment of official reserve assets by the government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof, its monetary institutions or a bank performing central banking functions in that State; or

_b)_      the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer. For the purposes of this Article, the term “financial institution” means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance.

4.         Notwithstanding paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph b) of that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if the interest is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans.

5.         The term “interest” in this Article includes interest from government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, interest from any other form of indebtedness, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the law of the Contracting State in which the income arises. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.

6.         The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated in that other State, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

7.         Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

8.         Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might reasonably have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of that relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

_A__rticle__12_

ROYALTIES

1.         Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2.         However, those royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3.         The term “royalties” in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for:

_a)_      the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; or

_b)_      the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information; or

_c)_       the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph a) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph b); or

_d)_      the use of, or the right to use:

_(i)_      motion picture films; or

_(ii)_     films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio or other broadcasting; or

_e)_total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph.

4.         The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated in that other State, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5.         Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6.         Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might reasonably have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the amount of the payments or credits shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

2.         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:

_a)_      the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year of that other State; and

_A__rticle__23_

ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

1.         Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), French tax paid under the law of France and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in France shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income.

2.         In the case of France, double taxation shall be avoided in the following manner:

_a)_      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Convention, income which may be taxed or shall be taxable only in Australia in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be taken into account for the computation of the French tax where the beneficiary of such income is a resident of France and where such income is not exempted from corporation tax according to French domestic law. In that case, the Australian tax shall not be deductible from such income but the resident of France shall, subject to the conditions and limits provided for in subparagraph (i) and (ii), be entitled to a tax credit against French tax. Such tax credit shall be equal:

_(i)_      in the case of income other than mentioned in subparagraph (ii), to the amount of French tax attributable to such income provided that the resident of France is subject to Australian tax in respect of such income;

_(ii)_     in the case of income referred to in Article 7 and paragraph 2 of Article 13 which is subject to the corporation tax, and in the case of income  referred to in Article 10, Article 11, Article 12, paragraph 1 of Article 13 and paragraph 3 of Article 14, Article 15, Article 16 and Article 20, to the amount of tax paid in Australia in accordance with the provisions of those Articles. However, such tax credit shall not exceed the amount of French tax attributable to such income.

_b)_      The term “amount of French tax attributable to such income” as used in subparagraph a) means:

_(i)_      where the tax of such income is computed by applying a proportional rate, the amount of the net income concerned multiplied by the rate which actually applies to that income;

_(ii)_     where the tax on such income is computed by applying a progressive scale, the amount of the net income concerned multiplied by the rate resulting from the ratio of the tax actually payable on the total net income taxable in accordance with French law to the amount of that total net income. 

_a__rticle__24_

MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE

1.         Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for the person in taxation not in accordance with this Convention, the person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States concerning taxes to which this Convention applies, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident. The case must be presented within 3 years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with this Convention.

2.         The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Convention. The solution so reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

3.         The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention. In particular, they may consult together to endeavour to agree to the same allocation of income between associated enterprises mentioned in Article 9\. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention. 

4.         The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

5.         For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States.  Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of this Article or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.

_A__rticle__25_

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION

1.         The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 2 insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention.  The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1.

2.         Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administration bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above.  Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes.  They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

3.         In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

_a)_      to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

_b)_      to supply information which is not obtainable by the competent authority under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

_c)_       to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).

4.         If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes.  The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 except where such limitations would preclude a Contracting State from supplying information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

5.         In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or relates to ownership interests in a person.

_a__rticle__26_

ASSISTANCE IN RECOVERY

1.         The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Article 1\. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.

2.         The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 2, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount.

3.         When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.

4.         When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection.

5.         Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraphs 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.

6.         Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State.

7.         Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be:

_a)_      in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or

_b)_      in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection

the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.

8.         In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

_a)_to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

_b)_      to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public);

_c)_       to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice;

_d)_      to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State;

_e)_       to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles.

_a__rticle__27_

DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PRIVILEGES

If that person ceases to be a resident of France for a period of at least three years, and then becomes a resident of France again, property situated outside France which that person owns on 1st January in each of the five calendar years following that in which the person became a resident of France again shall not be included in the basis of assessment of the tax pertaining to each of those five years.

_a__rticle__29_

PARTNERSHIPS

_b)_      a <span class="charParagraphtext5French">partner who is a resident of </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">France</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> :</span>

(ii)     shall be taxable in respect of their share of such income, profits or gains of the partnership arising in France as though the partner had derived such amounts directly but any such amounts which are taxed in Australia shall be treated for the purpose of paragraph 2 of Article 23 of this Convention as arising from sources in Australia.

2.         In the case of a partnership which has its place of effective management in a State other than a Contracting State and which is treated in that third State as fiscally transparent, a partner who is a resident of a Contracting State and whose share of the income, profits or gains of the partnership is taxed in that Contracting State in all respects as though those amounts had been derived directly by the partner, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Convention with respect to their share of such amounts arising in the other Contracting State as though the partner had derived such amounts directly, subject to the following conditions: 

_a)_      the absence of contrary provisions in a taxation convention between a Contracting State and the third State; and

_b)_     the partner’s share of the income, profits or gains of the partnership is taxed in the same manner, including the nature or source of those amounts and the time when those amounts are taxed, as would have been the case if the amounts had been derived directly; and

_c)_       it is possible to exchange information concerning the partnership or partners under the terms of a taxation convention between the Contracting State in which the income, profits or gains arise and the third State.

3\.         For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, income, profits or gains shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State in particular where they are attributable to a permanent establishment which the partnership or entity has in that State.

4.         Where, under any provision of this Convention, a partnership or other group of persons which is a resident of France in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 4, is entitled to relief from tax in Australia on any income, profits or gains, that provision shall not be construed as restricting the right of Australia to tax any member of the partnership or other group who is a resident of Australia on their share of such amounts; but any such amounts shall be treated for the purposes of paragraph 1 of Article 23 of this Convention as arising from sources in France.

TAXATION OF INCOME

ARTICLE 6

(4)   The provisions of paragraph (1) shall also apply to the income from real property of an enterprise and to the income from real property used for the performance of professional services.

ARTICLE 7

_Business Profits_

(1)   The profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting  State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions, expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(5)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment of an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(6)   For the purposes of this Article, except as provided in the Articles referred to in this paragraph, the profits of an enterprise do not include items of income dealt with in Articles 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 17 and in paragraph (1) of Article 13.

(7)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States from carrying on a business of any form of insurance, other than life insurance, may be taxed in the other Contracting State according to the law of that State, provided that if the law in force at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the Contracting Governments shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

(8)   The amount of the profits attributable to a permanent establishment situated in Belgium of an enterprise carried on by a company that is a resident of Australia may be taxed in Belgium at the rate fixed by the law of Belgium, provided that such rate shall not exceed the highest rate applicable to profits of a company which is a resident of Belgium.

(9)   If Australia imposes on profits attributable to a permanent establishment situated in Australia of an enterprise carried on by a company that is a resident of Belgium any tax which is in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on those profits if they were the profits of an enterprise carried on by a company that is a resident of Australia, the Contracting Governments shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to such amendments to paragraph (8) of this Article as may be appropriate.

ARTICLE 8

_Shipping and Air Transport_

(1)   Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), such profits may be taxed in the other Contracting  State where they are profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that other State.

(3)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of a Contracting State through participation in a pool service, in a joint transport operating organization or in an international operating agency.

(4)   For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise shipped in a Contracting State for discharge at another place in that State shall be treated as profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to the places in that State.

(5)   The amount which shall be charged to tax in one of the Contracting States as profits from operations of ships or aircraft in respect of which a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first--mentioned State under paragraph (2) or (3) shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount paid or payable (net of rebates) in respect of carriage in such operations.

(6)   Paragraph (5) shall not apply to profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft by a resident of one of the Contracting States whose principal place of business is in the other Contracting State, nor shall it apply to profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft by a resident of a Contracting State if those profits are derived otherwise than from the carriage of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise.

ARTICLE 9

_Associated__Enterprise_

(1)   Where—

     (a)  an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(3)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1) or (2), in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to the enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make such adjustment as it considers appropriate to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining any adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement, and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

ARTICLE 10

_Dividends_

(1)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such dividends may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

(3)   The term “dividends” in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. In the case of Belgium, the term includes income, even when paid in the form of interest, which is taxable under the head of income from capital invested by the members of a company which is a resident of Belgium for the purposes of its tax and is not a company with share capital.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State, being the State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

(5)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Belgium, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of Australia is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in Australia except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in Australia. Provided that this paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Belgium for the purposes of Belgian tax and which is also a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax.

ARTICLE 11

_Interest_

(1)   Interest arising in one of the Contracting States, being interest to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such interest may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

(3)   The term “interest” in this Article includes interest from Government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and interest from any other form of indebtedness as well as all other income assimilated to interest by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises. The term does not include income which is paid in the form of interest but which is, in accordance with paragraph (3) of Article 10, to be treated as dividends.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State, being the State in which the interest arises, and the indebtedness giving rise to the interest is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

(5)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a political sub--division of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however—

     (a)  the person paying the interest is a resident of one of the Contracting States and has in the other State or outside both States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred and the interest is borne by the permanent establishment, then the interest shall be deemed to arise in the State where the permanent establishment is situated;

     (b)  the person paying the interest is not a resident of either of the Contracting States but has in one of the States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred and the interest is borne by the permanent establishment, then the interest shall be deemed to arise in the State where the permanent establishment is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the interest arises according to the law of that State.

ARTICLE 12

_Royalties_

(1)   Royalties arising in one of the Contracting States, being royalties to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such royalties may be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

(3)   The term “royalties” in this Article means payments, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trade--mark, or other like property or right, or industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information, or for the supply of any assistance of an ancillary or subsidiary nature furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of such knowledge or information or any other property or right to which this Article applies, and includes any payments to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, motion picture films, films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business through a permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State, being the State in which the royalties arise, and the asset giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected with that permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a political sub--division of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however—

     (a)  the person paying the royalties is a resident of one of the Contracting States and has in the other State or outside both States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State where the permanent establishment is situated;

     (b)  the person paying the royalties is not a resident of either of the Contracting States but has in one of the States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State where the permanent establishment is situated.

In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the royalties arise according to the law of that State.

CHAPTER IV

METHODS OF ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

ARTICLE 24

(1)   In the case of Australia, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

     (a)  Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principal hereof), Belgian tax paid, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in Belgium (not including, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income.

     (b)  In the event that Australia should cease to allow a company which is a resident of Australia a rebate in its assessment at the average rate of tax payable by the company in respect of dividends derived from sources in Belgium and included in the taxable income of the company, the Contracting Governments will enter into negotiations in order to establish new provisions concerning the credit to be allowed by Australia against its tax on the dividends.

(2)   In the case of Belgium, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

     (a)  Where a resident of Belgium derives income which may be taxed in Australia in accordance with this Agreement and which is not subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b) or (c) below, Belgium shall exempt such income from tax but may, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of that resident, apply the rate of tax which would have been applicable if such income had not been exempted.

     (b)  In the case of—

                (i)     dividends taxable in accordance with paragraph (2) of Article 10, and not exempt from Belgian tax according to subparagraph (c) below;

               (ii)     interest taxable in accordance with paragraph (2) or (6) of Article 11; and

              (iii)     royalties taxable in accordance with paragraph (2) or (6) of Article 12, there shall be allowed as a credit against Belgian tax relating to such income the fixed proportion in respect of foreign tax for which provision is made under Belgian law, under the conditions and at the rate fixed by such law, provided that this rate shall not be less than the rate of tax which may be levied in Australia in accordance with paragraph (2) of Article 10, paragraph (2) of Article 11 or paragraph (2) of Article 12.

     (c)  Where a company which is a resident of Belgium owns shares in a company with share capital which is a resident of Australia and which is subject to Australian tax on its profits, the dividends which are paid to it by the latter company and which may be taxed in Australia in accordance with paragraph (2) of Article 10 shall be exempt from the corporate income tax in Belgium to the extent that exemption would have been accorded if the two companies had been residents of Belgium.

     (d)  Where, in accordance with Belgian law, losses of an enterprise carried on by a resident of Belgium which are attributable to a permanent establishment situated in Australia have been effectively deducted from the profits of that enterprise for its taxation in Belgium, the exemption provided in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall not apply in Belgium to the profits of other taxable periods attributable to that establishment to the extent that those profits have also been freed from tax in Australia by reason of a deduction for the said losses.

CHAPTER V

SPECIAL PROVISIONS

ARTICLE 25

_Mutual Agreement Procedure_

(1)   Where a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of the competent authority of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action giving rise to taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

(2)   The competent authority shall endeavour, if the taxpayer’s claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

(3)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall jointly endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application of this Agreement.

The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1\. Any information received by the competent authority of a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which this Agreement applies and shall be used by that competent authority only for such purposes.

(2)   In no case shall the provisions of paragraph (1) be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation—

     (a)  to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (b)  to supply particulars which are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

ARTICLE 27

_Miscellaneous_

(1)   With respect to a company which is a resident of Belgium for the purposes of Belgian tax, the provisions of this Agreement shall not limit the taxation of that company in accordance with the Belgian law in the event of the repurchase by the company of its own shares or in the event of the distribution of its assets.

(2)   Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic or consular officials under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international Agreements.

_2.         Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above.

_5.         In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, trust, foundation, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. To the extent necessary to obtain such information, the tax administration of the requested Contracting State shall have the power to require the disclosure of information and to conduct investigations and hearings notwithstanding any contrary provisions in its domestic tax laws.”_

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(5)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment of an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(3)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1) or (2), in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State.

     (b)  in any other case, not exceed 25 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the taxation of a company in respect of profits out of which dividends are paid.

(3)   The term “dividends” in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base situated in that other State.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political subdivision of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and the interest is borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the interest shall be deemed to arise where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

(7)   Interest derived by the Government of a Contracting State, or by any other body exercising governmental functions in, or in a part of, a Contracting State, or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State, shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting State.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the asset giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a political sub--division of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in the other Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

(7)   The principles set forth in paragraphs (1) to (7) inclusive of Article 5 shall be applied in determining for the purposes of this Article whether there is a permanent establishment outside both Contracting States, and whether an enterprise, not being an enterprise of one of the Contracting States, has a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States.

ARTICLE 23

_Source of Income_

Income derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States which, under any one or more of Articles 6 to 8 and 10 to 17 may be taxed in the other Contracting State, shall, for the purposes of Article 24 and of the income tax law of that other State, be deemed to be income from sources in that other State.

**Chapter IV**

**METHODS OF ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION**

ARTICLE 24

(1)   Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Philippine tax paid, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in the Philippines (excluding, in the case of dividends, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid except to the extent that the provisions of paragraph (2) may permit that tax to be included) shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income.

(2)   A company which is a resident of Australia is, in accordance with the provisions of the taxation law of Australia in force at the date of signature of this Agreement, entitled to a rebate in its assessment at the average rate of tax payable by the company in respect of dividends that are included in its taxable income and are received from a company that is a resident of the Philippines. However, should the law so in force be amended so that the rebate in relation to the dividends ceases to be allowable under that law, credit shall be allowed to the first--mentioned company under paragraph (1) for the Philippine tax paid on the profits out of which the dividends are paid, but only if that company beneficially owns at least 10 per cent of the paid--up share capital of the second--mentioned company.

(3)   For the purposes of paragraph (1) and of the income tax law of Australia—

     (a)  a resident of Australia deriving income from sources in the Philippines, consisting of royalties to which sub--paragraph (a) of paragraph (2) of Article 12 applies, shall be deemed to have paid, in addition to any Philippine tax actually paid, Philippine tax in an amount equal to 5% of the gross amount of the royalties; and

     (b)  the amount of the said royalties shall be deemed to be the amount that would have been the amount of the royalties if no Philippine tax had been paid, increased by 5%.

(4)   In accordance with the provisions and subject to the limitations of the law of the Philippines (as it may be amended from time to time without changing the general principle hereof), the Philippines shall allow to a resident of the Philippines as a credit against the Philippine tax the appropriate amount of taxes paid or accrued to Australia. In the case of a Philippine corporation owning more than 50 per cent of the voting stock of an Australian corporation from which it receives dividends in any taxable year, the Philippines shall also allow credit for the appropriate amount of taxes paid or accrued to Australia by an Australian corporation paying such dividends with respect to the profits out of which such dividends are paid. Such appropriate amount shall be based upon the amount of tax paid or accrued to Australia, but the credit shall not exceed the limitations (for the purpose of limiting the credit to the Philippine tax on income from sources within Australia, and on income from sources outside the Philippines) provided by Philippine law for the taxable year.

**Chapter V**

**SPECIAL PROVISIONS**

ARTICLE 25

_Mutual Agreement Procedure_

(1)   Where a resident of one of the Contracting States considers that the actions of the competent authority of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. The case must be presented in writing within two years from the first notification of the action.

(2)   The competent authority shall endeavour, if the taxpayer’s claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

(3)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall jointly endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application of this Agreement.

(4)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 26

_Exchange of Information_

(1)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for the carrying out of this Agreement or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning the taxes to which this Agreement applies insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1\. Any information received by the competent authority of a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which this Agreement applies and shall be used only for such purposes.

(2)   In no case shall the provisions of paragraph (1) be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation—

     (a)  to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (b)  to supply particulars which are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (c)  to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or to supply information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.

ARTICLE 27

_Diplomatic and Consular Officials_

Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic or consular officals under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

ARTICLE 28

_Miscellaneous_

If, under any Agreement or Convention concluded by the Philippines, a resident of any other country is exempt from—

     (a)  the Philippine income tax on gross billings relating to the operation of aircraft in international traffic; or

     (a)  the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;

     (b)  the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;

     (c)  the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;

     (d)  the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or for collecting information, for the enterprise;

(4)   An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if—

     (a)  it carries on supervisory activities in that State for more than twelve months in connection with a building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project which is being undertaken in that State; or

     (b)  substantial equipment is being used in that State for more than twelve months by, for or under contract with the enterprise in exploration for, or the exploitation of, natural resources, or in activities connected with such exploration or exploitation.

(5)   A person acting in one of the Contracting States on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State—other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph (6) applies—shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment of that enterprise in the first--mentioned State if—

     (a)  he has, and habitually exercises in that State, an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to the purchase of goods or merchandise for the enterprise; or

     (b)  in so acting, he manufactures or processes in that State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, provided that this provision shall apply only in relation to the goods or merchandise so manufactured or processed.

(6)   An enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, where that person is acting in the ordinary course of his business as such a broker or agent.

(7)   The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise) shall not of itself make either company a permanent establishment of the other.

(8)   The principles set forth in paragraphs (1) to (7) inclusive shall be applied in determining for the purposes of this Agreement whether an enterprise, not being an enterprise of one of the Contracting States, has a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States.

Chapter III

TAXATION OF INCOME

ARTICLE 6

_Income from Real Property_

(1)   Income from real property may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the real property is situated.

_Business Profits_

(1)   The profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting  State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contacting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general adminstrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(5)   Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

ARTICLE 8

_Shipping and Air Transport_

(1)   Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), such profits may be taxed in the other Contracting  State where they are profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that other State.

(3)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States through participation in a pool service, in a joint transport operating organization or in an international operating agency.

(4)   For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise shipped in one of the Contracting States for discharge at another place in that State shall be treated as profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that State.

(5)   The amount which shall be charged to tax in one of the Contracting States as profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in respect of which a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first--mentioned State under paragraph (2) or (3) shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount paid or payable (net of rebates) in respect of carriage in such operations.

(6)   Paragraph (5) shall not apply to profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft by a resident of one of the Contracting States whose principal place of business is in the other Contracting State, nor shall it apply to profits derived from the operation of ships or aircraft by a resident of one of the Contracting States if those profits are derived otherwise than from the carriage of passengers, livestock, mails, goods or merchandise. In such cases, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

ARTICLE 9

_Associated Enterprises_

Where—

     (a)  an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

ARTICLE 10

_Dividends_

(1)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such dividends may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

(3)   The term “dividends” in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, being the State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In any such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State. Provided that this paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of Switzerland for the purposes of Swiss tax.

ARTICLE 11

_Interest_

(1)   Interest arising in one of the Contracting States, being interest to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such interest may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

(3)   The term “interest” in this Article includes interest from Government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, and interest from any other form of indebtedness as well as all other income assimilated to interest by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, being the State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the indebtedness giving rise to the interest is effectively connected with the permanent establishment or fixed base. In any such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in one of the Contracting States when the payer is that Contracting State itself or a political sub--division of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in one of the Contracting States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12

_Royalties_

(1)   Royalties arising in one of the Contracting States being royalties to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such royalties may be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

(3)   The term “royalties” in this Article means payments (including credits), whether periodical or not and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right, or industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information, or any assistance of an ancillary and subsidiary nature furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of such knowledge or information or any other property or right to which this Article applies, or for the use of, or the right to use, motion picture films, films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting, or for total or partial forbearance in respect of the use of a property or right referred to in this paragraph.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, being the State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the asset giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base. In any such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in one of the Contracting States when the payer is that Contracting State itself or a political sub--division of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in one of the Contracting States a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 13

_Alienation of Property_

(1)   Income or gains from the alienation of real property or of a direct interest in or over land or of a right to exploit, or to explore for, a natural resource may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the real property, the land or the natural resource is situated.

(2)   For the purposes of this Article, shares or comparable interests in a company, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of real property or of direct interests in or over land in one of the Contracting States or of rights to exploit, or to explore for, natural resources in one of the Contracting States, shall be deemed to be real property situated in the Contracting State in which the land or the natural resources are situated or in which the exploration may take place.

(3)   Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2), income from the alienation of capital assets of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that Contracting State, but, where those assets form part of the business property of a permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State, such income may be taxed in that other State.

ARTICLE 14

_Independent Personal Services_

(1)   Income derived by an individual who is a resident of one of the Contracting States in respect of professional services or other independent activities of a similar character shall be taxable only in that State unless he has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities. If he has such a fixed base, the income may be taxed in the other State but only so much of it as is attributable to activities exercised from that fixed base.

(2)   The term “professional services” includes services performed in the exercise of independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as in the exercise of the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants.

ARTICLE 15

ARTICLE 22

(1)   Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Swiss tax paid, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a resident of Australia from sources in Switzerland (not including, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income.

(2)   Where a resident of Switzerland derives income dealt with in this Agreement and which, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in Australia, Switzerland shall, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), exempt such income from Swiss tax but may, in calculating tax on the remaining income of that person, apply the rate of tax which would have been applicable if the exempted income had not been so exempted.

(3)   Where a resident of Switzerland derives dividends, interest or royalties which, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12, may be taxed in Australia,   Switzerland shall allow, upon request, relief to that person. The relief may consist of:

     (a)  a deduction from the Swiss tax on the income of that person of an amount equal to the tax levied in Australia in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12; such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Swiss tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Australia, or

     (c)  a partial exemption of such dividends, interest or royalties from Swiss tax, in any case consisting at least of the deduction of the tax levied in Australia from the gross amount of the dividends, interest or royalties.

Switzerland shall determine the applicable relief and regulate the procedure in accordance with the Swiss provisions relating to the carrying out of international conventions of the Swiss Confederation for the avoidance of double taxation.

(4)   A company which is a resident of Switzerland and which derives dividends from a company which is a resident of Australia shall be entitled, for the purposes of Swiss tax with respect to such dividends, to the same relief which would be granted if the company paying the dividends were a resident of Switzerland.

**Chapter V**

**SPECIAL PROVISIONS**

ARTICLE 23

(2)   The competent authority shall endeavour, if the taxpayer’s claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

No information as aforesaid shall be exchanged which would disclose any trade, business, industrial or professional secret or trade process.

(2)   In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed as imposing upon either of the Contracting States the obligation to carry out administrative measures at variance with the regulations and practice of either Contracting State or which would be contrary to its sovereignty, security or public policy or to supply particulars which are not procurable under its own legislation or that of the State making application.

ARTICLE 25

_Source of Income_

Income derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States which, under any one or more of Articles 6 to 8 and 10 to 17 may be taxed in the other Contracting State, shall for the purposes of Article 22, and of the income tax law of that other State, be deemed to be income from sources in that other State.

ARTICLE 26

_Diplomatic and Consular Officials_

(1)   Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic or consular officials under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

(2)   For the purposes of this Agreement, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of one of the Contracting States which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed to be a resident of the sending Contracting State if—

     (a)  in accordance with international law he is not liable to tax in the receiving Contracting State in respect of income from sources outside that Contracting State, and

     (b)  he is liable in the sending Contracting State to the same obligations in relation to tax on his total income as are residents of that Contracting State.

(3)   This Agreement shall not apply to international organisations, to organs or officials thereof or to persons who are members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a third State, being present in one of the Contracting States and not treated in either Contracting State as residents in respect of taxes on income.

PROTOCOL

The Government of Australia and

the Swiss Federal Council

Have agreed at the signing of the Agreement between the two States for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income upon the following provisions which shall form an integral part of the said Agreement.

(1)   With reference to Article 2,

            the provisions of the Australian law relating specifically to the income tax upon the reduced taxable income of a non--resident company in existence at the date of signature of this Agreement are to be applied in ascertaining the income subject to that tax or, if those provisions are amended so as to make more favourable to the company the ascertainment of that income, those provisions as so amended are to be so applied.

(2)   With reference to Article 7,

     (a)  insofar as it has been customary in one of the Contracting States to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph (2) of Article 7 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in that Article;

     (b)  for the purposes of (a) and of paragraphs (1) to (4) of Article 7, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary;

     (c)  Article 7 of the Agreement shall not apply to profits of an enterprise from carrying on a business of any form of insurance, other than life insurance.

(3)   With reference to Articles 7 and 9,

            where the information available to the competent authority of one of the Contracting States is inadequate to determine the profits of an enterprise on which tax may be imposed in that State in accordance with Article 7 or Article 9 of the Agreement, nothing in those Articles shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of an enterprise in special circumstances, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of those Articles.

(4)   With reference to Articles 10, 11 and 12, if, in an Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation that is subsequently made between Australia and a third State being a State that at the date of signature of this Protocol is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co--operation and Development, Australia shall agree to limit the rate of its taxation—

     (a)  on dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax to which a company that is a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 10; or

     (b)  on interest arising in Australia to which a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 11; or

     (c)  on royalties arising in Australia to which a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 12,

the Government of Australia shall immediately inform the Swiss Federal Council in writing through the diplomatic channel and shall enter into negotiations with the Swiss Federal Council to review the provisions specified in (a), (b) and (c) above in order to provide the same treatment for Switzerland as that provided for the third State.

3.    In the determination of the income or profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses (including executive and general administrative expenses) which are reasonably connected with the permanent establishment and which would be deductable if the permanent establishment were an independent entity that incurred those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

6.    Where income or profits include any item of income or profits which is dealt with separately in another Article of this Agreement, the provisions of that other Article, (except where otherwise provided in that Article) shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

ARTICLE 8

Shipping and Air Transport

1.    Income or profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State.

4.    For the purposes of this Article, income or profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise shipped in a Contracting State for discharge at another place in that State shall be treated as income or profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that State.

5.    Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of the law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of tax liability by the exercise of a discretion or the making of an estimate by the competent authority in determining the tax liability of a resident of the other Contracting State in respect of operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in the first--mentioned State.

ARTICLE 9

Associated Enterprises

1.    Where—

     (a)  an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing at arm’s length, then any income or profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the income or profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2.    If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the income or profits to be attributed to an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person by the exercise of a discretion or the making of an estimate by the competent authority, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

1.    Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

2.    Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax, being dividends to which a resident of Malaysia is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in Australia according to the law of Australia, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

3.    Subject to paragraph 4, dividends paid by a company which is resident in Malaysia for the purposes of Malaysian tax, being dividends to which a resident of Australia is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from any tax in Malaysia which is chargeable on dividends in addition to the tax chargeable in respect of the income or profits of the company:

       Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the provisions of the Malaysian law under which the tax in respect of a dividend paid by a company resident in Malaysia from which Malaysian tax has been, or has been deemed to be, deducted may be adjusted by reference to the rate of tax appropriate to the Malaysian year of assessment immediately following that in which the dividend was paid.

4.    If after the date of signature of this Agreement the existing system of taxation in Malaysia applicable to the income and distributions of companies is altered by the introduction of a tax on the income or profits of a company (for which no credit or only partial credit is given to its shareholders) and of a further tax on dividends pay by the company, the Malaysian tax on dividends, being dividends paid by a company which is resident in Malaysia for the purposes of Malaysian tax, and to which a resident of Australia is beneficially entitled, shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

5.    Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State:

       Provided that this paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by a company which is both a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and resident in Malaysia for the purposes of Malaysian tax.

6.    The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 5 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, has in the other Contracting State, in which the company paying the dividends is resident, a permanent establishment which the holding by virtue of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

7.    Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Malaysia shall include dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Singapore which for the purpose of those dividends has declared itself to be a resident of Malaysia, but shall not include dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Malaysia which for the purpose of those dividends has declared itself to be a resident of Singapore.

8.    The term “dividends” in this Article includes any item which, under the laws of the Contracting  State of which the company paying the dividend is a resident, is treated as a dividend of a company.

9.    Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the income of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the chargeable income or taxable income, as the case may be, of a company which is a resident of the first--mentioned State:

       Provided that any additional tax so imposed by the first--mentioned State shall not exceed 15 per cent of the amount by which the chargeable income or taxable income for the year of assessment or year of income exceeds the tax which would have been payable on that income if the company had been a resident of the first--mentioned State.

4.    The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, has in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises a permanent establishment with which the debt--claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected. In such a case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5.    Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a political sub--division, a local authority or statutory body thereof or a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6.    Where the payer is related to the person beneficially entitled to the interest and the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the debt--claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might be expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled if they had not been related, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. For the purposes of this paragraph, a person is related to another person if either person participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the other, or if any third person or persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of both.

7.    The term “interest” in this Article means interest from Government securities, or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, and from debt--claims of every kind as well as other income assimilated to interest from money lent by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

3.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, approved industrial royalties derived from Malaysia by a resident of Australia who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be exempt from Malaysian tax.

4.    The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, has in the other Contracting State from which the royalties are derived a permanent establishment with which the right, property, knowledge, information or assistance giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected. In such a case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5.    Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting  State itself or a political sub--division, a local authority or statutory body thereof or a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6.    Where the payer is related to the person beneficially entitled to the royalties and the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to the use, to the right to use, or to the knowledge, information or assistance, for which they are paid or credited, exceeds the amount which might be expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled if they had not been related, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the royalties paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. For the purposes of this paragraph, a person is related to another person if either person participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the other, or if any third person or persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of both.

7.    The term “royalties” in this Article means payments or credits of any kind to the extent to which they are made as consideration for—

ARTICLE 23

Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1.    The laws in force in each of the Contracting States shall continue to govern the taxation of income in that Contracting State except where provision to the contrary is made in this Agreement. Where income is subject to tax in both Contracting States, relief from double taxation shall be given in accordance with the following paragraphs.

2.    In the case of Malaysia, subject to the provisions of the law of Malaysia regarding the allowance as a credit against Malaysian tax of tax payable in any country other than Malaysia, the amount of Australian tax payable under the law of Australia and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, by a resident of Malaysia in respect of income from sources within Australia shall be allowed as a credit against Malaysian tax payable in respect of such income, but in an amount not exceeding the proportion of Malaysian tax which such income bears to the entire income chargeable to Malaysian tax.

3.   (a)  Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Malaysian tax paid, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in Malaysia shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable on the income on which the Malaysian tax was paid. However, where the income consists of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of Malaysia, the credit shall, subject to sub--paragraph (b), only take into account such tax in respect thereof as is additional to any tax payable by the company on the profits out of which the dividend is paid and is ultimately borne by the recipient without reference to any tax so payable.

     (b)  A company which is a resident of Australia is, in accordance with the provisions of the taxation law of Australia in force at the date of signature of this Agreement, entitled to a rebate in its assessment at the average rate of tax payable by the company in respect of dividends that are included in its taxable income and are received from a company which is a resident of Malaysia. However, should the law so in force be amended so that the rebate in relation to the dividends ceases to be allowable under that law, credit shall be allowed under sub--paragraph (a) to the first--mentioned company for the Malaysian tax paid on the profits out of which the dividends are paid, as well as for the Malaysian tax paid on the dividends for which credit is to be allowed under sub--paragraph (a), but only if that company beneficially owns at least 10 per cent of the paid--up share capital of the second--mentioned company.

4.    Where the income or profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that Contracting State are also included in the income or profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State as being income or profits which, because of the conditions operative between the two enterprises, might have been expected to accrue to the enterprise of that other Contracting State if the enterprises had been independent enterprises dealing at arm’s length, the income or profits so included shall be treated for the purposes of this Article as income or profits of the enterprise of the first--mentioned Contracting State from a source in the other Contracting State and credit shall be given in accordance with this Article in respect of the extra tax chargeable in that other Contracting State as a result of the inclusion of such income or profits.

5.    For the purposes of paragraph 6, the term “Malaysian tax forgone” means—

     (a)  an amount which, under the laws of Malaysia and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Malaysian tax on income had that income not been exempted either wholly or partly from Malaysian tax in accordance with—

                (i)     Schedule 7A of the Income Tax Act 1967 of Malaysia or sections 21, 22, 26 or 30Q of the Investment Incentives Act 1968 of Malaysia, so far as they were in force on, and have not been modified since, the date of signature of this Agreement or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character; or

               (ii)     any other provisions which may subsequently be agreed in an Exchange of Letters between the Governments of the Contracting States to be of a substantially similar character;

     (b)  in the case of interest derived by a resident of Australia which is exempt from Malaysian tax in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 11, the amount which, under the law of Malaysia and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Malaysian tax if the interest were interest to which paragraph 3 of Article 11 did not apply, and if the tax referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 11 were not to exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest; and

     (c)  in the case of royalties derived by a resident of Australia, being approved industrial royalties which are exempt from Malaysian tax in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 12, the amount which, under the law of Malaysia and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Malaysian tax if the royalties were royalties to which paragraph 3 of Article 12 did not apply and if the tax referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 12 were not to exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

6.   (a)  For the purposes of sub--paragraph (a) or (b) of paragraph 3, Malaysian tax forgone which answers the description in sub--paragraph (a) of paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be Malaysian tax paid.

     (b)  For the purposes of sub--paragraph (a) of paragraph 3, Malaysian tax forgone which answers the description in sub--paragraph (b) or (c) of paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be Malaysian tax paid.

     (c)  For the purposes of the income tax law of Australia—

                (i)     In the event that the rebate in relation to dividends, referred to in sub--paragraph (b) of paragraph 3, ceases to be allowable in Australia, the amount of the income referred to in sub--paragraph (a) of paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be increased by the amount that is deemed in accordance with sub--paragraph (a) of this paragraph to be Malaysian tax paid; and

               (ii)     the amount of interest or royalties referred to in sub--paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be increased by the amount that is deemed in accordance with sub--paragraph (b) of this paragraph to be Malaysian tax paid.

7.   (a)  Paragraphs 5 and 6 shall not apply in relation to income derived in any year of income after the year of income that ends on 30 June 1984 or any later date that may be agreed by the Governments of the Contracting States, after the consultations referred to in sub--paragraph (b), in Letters exchanged for this purpose.

     (b)  The Governments of the Contracting States shall consult each other in order to determine whether the period of application of paragraphs 5 and 6 shall be extended. For this purpose notice of intention to consult may be given not less than six months before the expiration of that period.

8.    If in an Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation that is subsequently made between Australia and a third State Australia should agree—

     (a)  in relation to dividends that are derived by a company which is a resident of Australia from a company which is a resident of the third State, to give credit for tax paid on the profits out of which the dividends are paid on the basis of a test of beneficial ownership by the first--mentioned company of less than 10 per cent of the paid--up share capital of the second--mentioned company; or

     (b)  to give relief from Australian tax of the kind that is provided for in relation to Malaysia in paragraphs 5 and 6, on a basis that, other than in minor respects, is more favourable in relation to the third State than that so provided for,

the Government of Australia shall immediately inform the Government of Malaysia and shall enter into negotiations with the Government of Malaysia with a view to providing treatment in relation to Malaysia comparable with that provided in relation to that third State.

9.    Where royalties derived by a resident of Australia are, as film rentals, subject to the cinematograph film--hire duty in Malaysia, that duty shall, for the purposes of sub--paragraph (a) of paragraph 3, be deemed to be Malaysian tax.

ARTICLE 24

Mutual Agreement Procedure

1.    Where a resident of one of the Contracting States considers that the actions of the competent authority of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the taxation laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. The case must be presented within two years from the first notification of the action.

2.    The competent authority shall endeavour, if the taxpayer’s claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Agreement. If the claim is made within six years of the end of the year of assessment or year of tax, as the case may be, the solution so reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the taxation laws of the Contracting States.

3.    The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall jointly endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement.

4.    The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Agreement.

1.    The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for the carrying out of this Agreement or for the prevention of fraud or for the administration of statutory provisions against legal avoidance in relation to the taxes to which this Agreement applies. Any information so exchanged shall be treated as secret and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment, collection, enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, those taxes to which this Agreement applies.

2.    In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation—

     (a)  to carry out any administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (b)  to supply particulars which are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (c)  to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.

ARTICLE 26

Diplomatic and Consular Officials

       Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic or consular officials under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

       Provided that where—

     (a)  in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Article, relief has not been allowed in the first instance in the first--mentioned State in respect of an amount of income; and

ARTICLE 28

       This Agreement shall come into force on the date on which the Government of Australia and the Government of Malaysia exchange notes through the diplomatic channel notifying each other that the last of such things has been done as is necessary to give this Agreement the force of law in Australia and in Malaysia, as the case may be, and thereupon this Agreement shall have effect—

Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1.  The laws in force in each of the Contracting States shall continue to govern the taxation of income in that Contracting  State except where provision to the contrary is made in this Agreement. Where income is subject to tax in both Contracting States, relief from double taxation shall be given in accordance with the following paragraphs.

2.  In the case of Malaysia, subject to the law of Malaysia regarding the allowance as a credit against Malaysian tax of tax payable in any country other than Malaysia, the amount of Australian tax payable under the law of Australia and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, by a resident of Malaysia in respect of income from sources within Australia shall be allowed as a credit against Malaysian tax payable in respect of that income. Where such income is a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of Australia to a company which is a resident of Malaysia and which owns not less than 10 per cent of the voting shares of the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account Australian tax payable by that company in respect of its income out of which the dividend is paid. The credit shall not, however, exceed that part of the Malaysian tax, as computed before the credit is given which is appropriate to such item of income.

3.       (a)        Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Malaysian tax paid under the law of Malaysia and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in Malaysia shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income.

          (b)        Where a company which is a resident of Malaysia and is not a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax pays a dividend to a company which is a resident of Australia and which controls directly or indirectly not less than 10 per cent of the voting power of the first--mentioned company, the credit referred to in subparagraph (a) shall include the Malaysian tax paid by that first--mentioned company in respect of that portion of its profits out of which the dividend is paid.

4.       Where the income or profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that Contracting State are also included in the income or profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State as being income or profits which, because of the conditions operative between the two enterprises, might have been expected to accrue to the enterprise of that other Contracting State if the enterprises had been independent enterprises dealing at arm’s length, the income or profits so included shall be treated for the purposes of this Article as income or profits of the enterprise of the first--mentioned Contracting State from a source in the other Contracting State and credit shall be given in accordance with this Article in respect of the extra tax chargeable in that other Contracting State as a result of the inclusion of such income or profits.

5.       For the purposes of paragraph 6, the term “Malaysian tax forgone” means—

          (a)   an amount which, under the laws of Malaysia and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Malaysian tax on income had that income not been exempted either wholly or partly from Malaysian tax in accordance with—

                 (i)      Schedule 7A of the Income Tax Act 1967 of Malaysia or sections 22, 23, 29, 35 and 37 of the Promotion of Investments Act 1986 of Malaysia and section 45 of that Act to the extent that it relates to sections 21, 22, 26, or 30Q of the Investment Incentives Act 1968, so far as the sections were in force on, and have not been modified since, the date of signature of the Protocol first amending the Agreement or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character; or

                 (ii)      any other provisions which may subsequently be agreed in an Exchange of Letters between the Governments of the Contracting States to be of a substantially similar character;

          (b)   in the case of interest derived by a resident of Australia which is exempt from Malaysian tax in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 11, the amount which, under the law of Malaysia and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Malaysian tax if the interest were interest to which paragraph 3 of Article 11 did not apply, and if the tax referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 11 were not to exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest; and

          (c)   in the case of royalties derived by a resident of Australia, being approved industrial royalties which are exempt from Malaysian tax in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 12, the amount which, under the law of Malaysia and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Malaysian tax if the royalties were royalties to which paragraph 3 of Article 12 did not apply and if the tax referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 12 were not to exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

6.         (a) For the purposes of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph 3, Malaysian tax forgone which answers the description in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be Malaysian tax paid.

          (b)   For the purposes of subparagraph (a) of paragraph 3, Malaysian tax forgone which answers the description in subparagraph (b) or (c) of paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be Malaysian tax paid.

7.       Paragraphs 5 and 6 shall apply only in relation to income derived in any of the 5 years of income beginning with the year of income that commenced on 1 July 1987 and in any later year of income that may be agreed in an Exchange of Letters for this purpose by the Governments of the Contracting States, or their authorised representatives.

8.       If in an Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation that is subsequently made between Australia and a third State, Australia should agree—

              (a)     in relation to dividends that are derived by a company which is a resident of Australia from a company which is a resident of the third State, to give credit for tax paid on the profits out of which the dividends are paid on the basis of a test of beneficial ownership by the first--mentioned company of less than 10 per cent of the paid--up share capital of the second--mentioned company; or

              (b)     to give relief from Australian tax of the kind that is provided for in relation to Malaysia in paragraphs 5 and 6, on a basis that, other than in minor respects, is more favourable in relation to the third State than that so provided for,

the Government of Australia shall immediately inform the Government of Malaysia and shall enter into negotiations with the Government of Malaysia with a view to providing treatment in relation to Malaysia comparable with that provided in relation to that third State.

9.       Where royalties derived by a resident of Australia are, as film rentals, subject to the cinematograph film--hire duty in Malaysia, that duty shall, for the purposes of subparagraph (a) of paragraph 3, be deemed to be Malaysian tax.

10.     Where gains derived by a resident of Australia are subject to real property gains tax in Malaysia, that tax shall, for the purposes of subparagraph 3(a), be deemed to be Malaysian tax.”.

Article 10

Entry into force

1.       This Protocol, which shall form an integral part of the Agreement, shall enter into force on the last of the dates on which the Contracting States exchange notes through the diplomatic channel notifying each other that the last of such things has been done as is necessary to give this Protocol the force of law in Australia and in Malaysia respectively, and thereupon this Protocol shall, subject to paragraph 2, have effect:

                 (iv)   in any other case, in relation to income of any year of income       beginning on or after 1 July in the calendar year next following             that in which this Protocol enters into force;

          (b)   in Malaysia:

                 (i)    for the purposes of Article 9 of the Protocol in respect of Malaysian tax for any year of assessment beginning on or after 1 January 1988;

                     (ii)    in the case of subparagraph (c) of Article 2 of the Protocol in      respect of tax for any year of assessment beginning on or after           1 January 1994; and

                 (iii)   in any other case, in respect of Malaysian tax for any year of assessment beginning on or after 1 January in the second calendar year following the calendar year in which this Protocol enters into force.

2.       Where any provision of the Agreement that is affected by this Protocol would have afforded any greater relief from tax than is afforded by the amendments made by this Protocol, that provision shall continue to have effect:

          (a)     in Australia, for any year of income; and

          (b)     in Malaysia, for any year of assessment,

In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.”.

This paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of Malaysia for the purposes of Malaysian tax.

          7.       Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Malaysia shall include dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Singapore which for the purpose of those dividends has declared itself to be a resident of Malaysia, but shall not include dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Malaysia which for the purpose of those dividends has declared itself to be a resident of Singapore.”.

If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   If the information available to the taxation authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the taxation authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(3)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1) or (2), in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement, and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

(3)   The term “dividends” in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base situated in that other State; provided that this paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of Sweden for the purposes of Swedish tax.

(6)   Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a Contracting State may impose on the income of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the taxable income of a company which is a resident of the first--mentioned State, provided that any additional tax so imposed by the first--mentioned State shall not exceed 15 per cent of the amount by which the taxable income of the year of income exceeds the tax which would have been payable on that taxable income if the company had been a resident of the first--mentioned State.

(7)   In this Article a reference to a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States for the purposes of its tax is, in the case of Sweden, a reference to a company which is subject to unlimited tax liability in Sweden.

(4)   The term “interest” in this Article includes interest from Government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, and interest from any other form of indebtedness as well as all other income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

(5)   The provisions of paragraph (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(6)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political sub--division or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. In this paragraph, a reference to a person who is a resident of a Contracting State is, in relation to a company, a reference to a company which, in the case of Australia, is a resident of Australia for the purposes of its tax, or, in the case of Sweden, is subject to unlimited tax liability in Sweden.

(7)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12

(3)   The term “royalties” in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for:

     (a)  the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right;

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political sub--division or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. In this paragraph, a reference to a person who is a resident of a Contracting State is, in relation to a company, a reference to a company which, in the case of Australia, is a resident of Australia for the purposes of its tax, or, in the case of Sweden is subject to unlimited tax liability in Sweden.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 13

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of one of the Contracting States in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first--mentioned State if:

     (a)  the recipient is present in that other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the year of income of that other State; and

     (b)  the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of that other State; and

(2)   A company which is a resident of Australia is, in accordance with the provisions of the taxation law of Australia in force at the date of signature of this Agreement, entitled to a rebate in its assessment at the average rate of tax payable by the company in respect of dividends that are included in its taxable income and are received from a company which is a resident of Sweden. However, should the law so in force be amended so that the rebate in relation to the dividends ceases to be allowable under that law, credit shall be allowed under paragraph (1) to the first--mentioned company for the Swedish tax paid on the profits out of which the dividends are paid, as well as for the Swedish tax paid on the dividends for which credit is to be allowed under paragraph (1), but only if that company beneficially owns at least 10 per cent of the paid--up share capital of the second--mentioned company.

(3)   Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (4) and (5) of this Article, where a resident of Sweden derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement may be taxed in Australia, Sweden shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that person, an amount equal to the income tax paid in Australia. The deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is appropriate to the income which may be taxed in Australia.

(4)   Where a resident of Sweden derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, shall be taxable only in Australia, Sweden may include this income in the tax case but shall allow as a deduction from the income tax that part of the income tax which is appropriate to the income derived from Australia.

(5)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of Article 10, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia and to which a company which is a resident of Sweden is beneficially entitled shall be exempt from Swedish tax to the extent that the dividends would have been exempt under Swedish law if both companies had been Swedish companies. This exemption shall not be granted unless the principal part of the profits or income of the company paying the dividends arises, directly or indirectly, from business activities other than the management of securities and other similar movable property and such activities are carried on within Australia by the company paying the dividends or by a company in which it owns at least 25 per cent of the paid--up share capital.

ARTICLE 25

<u>Mutual Agreement Procedure</u>

(1)   Where a resident of one of the Contracting States considers that the actions of the taxation authority of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action.

(2)   The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Agreement. The solution so reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the national laws of the Contracting States.

(3)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall jointly endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application of this Agreement.

(4)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 26

<u>Exchange of Information</u>

(1)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for the carrying out of this Agreement or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning the taxes to which this Agreement applies insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1\. Any information received by the competent authority of a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which this Agreement applies and shall be used only for such purposes.

(2)   In no case shall the provisions of paragraph (1) be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

     (a)  to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (b)  to supply particulars which are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (c)  to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or to supply information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.

ARTICLE 27

<u>Diplomatic and Consular Officials</u>

       Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic or consular officials under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

ARTICLE 28

<u>Entry into Force</u>

       This Agreement shall come into force on the date on which the Government of Australia and the Government of Sweden exchange notes at Stockholm through the diplomatic channel notifying each other that the last of such things has been done as is necessary to give this Agreement the force of law in Australia and in Sweden, as the case may be, and thereupon this Agreement shall have effect:

     (b)  In   Sweden, in respect of income derived on or after 1 January in the calendar year immediately following that in which the Agreement enters into force.

     (a)  in   Australia:

                (i)     in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non--resident, in relation to income derived on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given;

     (b)  the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;

     (e)  the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of activities which have a preparatory or auxiliary character for the enterprise, such as advertising or scientific research.

(4)   An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if—

     (a)  it carries on supervisory activities in that State for more than twelve months in connection with a building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project which is being undertaken in that State; or

     (b)  substantial equipment is being used in that State for more than twelve months by, for or under contract with the enterprise in exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources, or in activities connected with such exploration or exploitation.

(5)   A person acting in one of the Contracting States on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State—other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph (6) applies—shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment of that enterprise in the first--mentioned State if—

     (a)  he has, and habitually exercises in that State, an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to the purchase of goods or merchandise for the enterprise; or

     (b)  in so acting, he manufactures or processes in that State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise.

(6)   An enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, where that person is acting in the ordinary course of his business as such a broker or agent.

(7)   The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise) shall not of itself make either company a permanent establishment of the other.

(8)   The principles set forth in paragraphs (1) to (7) inclusive shall be applied in determining for the purposes of paragraph (5) of Article 11 and paragraph (5) of Article 12 of this Agreement whether there is a permanent establishment outside both Contracting States, and whether an enterprise, not being an enterprise of one of the Contracting States, has a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States.

ARTICLE 6

<u>Income from Real Property</u>

(1)   Income from real property, including royalties and other payments in respect of the operation of mines or quarries or of the exploitation of any natural resource, may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the real property, mines, quarries, or natural resources are situated.

(2)   Income from a lease of land and income from any other direct interest in or over land, whether or not improved, shall be regarded as income from real property situated where the land to which the lease or other direct interest relates is situated.

(3)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall also apply to the income from real property of an enterprise and to income from real property used for the performance of professional services.

ARTICLE 7

<u>Business Profits</u>

(1)   The profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting  State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph (2) shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.

(5)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(6)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment of an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(7)   Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

(8)   Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law of a Contracting State relating to taxation of profits from insurance with non--residents provided that if the relevant law in force in either State at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

ARTICLE 8

<u>Shipping and Air Transport</u>

(1)   Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), such profits may be taxed in the other Contracting  State where they are profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that other State.

(3)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States through participation in a pool service, in a joint transport operating organization or in an international operating agency.

(4)   For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise shipped in a Contracting State for discharge at another place in that State shall be treated as profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that State.

(5)   With respect to profits derived by the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish air transport consortium, known as the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall only apply to such part of the profits as corresponds to the shareholding in the consortium held by Det Danske Luftfartsselskab (DDL), the Danish partner of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).

ARTICLE 9

<u>Associated Enterprises</u>

(1)   Where—

     (a)  an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(3)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1) or (2), in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

ARTICLE 10

<u>Dividends</u>

(1)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such dividends may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

(3)   The term “dividends” in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base situated in that other State. Provided that this paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of Denmark for the purposes of Danish tax.

(6)   Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a Contracting State may impose on the income of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the taxable income of a company which is a resident of the first--mentioned State, provided that any additional tax so imposed by the first--mentioned State shall not exceed 15 per cent of the amount by which the taxable income of the year of income exceeds the tax which would have been payable on that taxable income if the company had been a resident of the first--mentioned State.

(7)   Where an individual who is a resident of Australia receives from a company which is a resident of Denmark a dividend to which he is beneficially entitled and which, if received by a resident of Denmark, would entitle the resident to the Danish tax credit (skattegodtgørelse)—

     (a)  the individual shall be entitled to the credit subject to the deduction of tax that would apply if that credit were a dividend;

     (b)  the amount of the credit shall be treated for purposes of Australian tax as assessable income from sources in Denmark.

ARTICLE 11

<u>Interest</u>

(1)   Interest arising in one of the Contracting States, being interest to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such interest may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

(3)   The term “interest” in this Article includes interest from Government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, and interest from any other form of indebtedness as well as all other income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political sub--division or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in that State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12

<u>Royalties</u>

(1)   Royalties arising in one of the Contracting States, being royalties to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such royalties may be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

(3)   The term “royalties” in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for—

     (a)  the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right;

     (b)  the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment;

     (c)   the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information;

     (d)  the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in paragraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in paragraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in paragraph (c);

     (e)  the use of, or the right to use—

                (i)     motion picture films;

               (ii)     films or video tapes for use in connection with television; or

              (iii)     tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting; or

      (f)  total or partial forbearance in respect of the use of a property or right referred to in this paragraph.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political sub--division or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 13

<u>Alienation of Property</u>

(1)   Income from alienation of real property may be taxed in the Contracting State in which that property is situated.

(2)   For the purposes of this Article—

     (a)  the term “real property” shall include—

ARTICLE 8

<u>Business Profits</u>

If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article, where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(3)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States through participation in a pool service, in a joint transport operating organization or in an international operating agency.

(4)   For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise shipped in a Contracting State for discharge at another place in that State shall be treated as profits from operations of ships or aircraft confined solely to places in that State.

     (a)  an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting  State; or

     (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to an enterprise, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, an enterprise of one of the Contracting States may be taxed by that Contracting State as if this Article had not entered into force and had not had effect but, so far as it is practicable to do so, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(4)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of this Article, in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

(5)   The provisions of paragraph (4) of this Article relating to an appropriate adjustment are not applicable after the expiration of six years from the end of the year of assessment or financial year, as the case may be, in respect of which a Contracting State has charged to tax the profits to which the adjustment would relate.

ARTICLE 11

<u>Dividends</u>

(1)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax, being dividends to which a resident of Ireland is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in Ireland. Such dividends may also be taxed in Australia, according to the law of Australia, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

(2) (a)  Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Ireland for the purposes of Irish tax, being dividends to which a resident of Australia is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in Australia.

     (b)  Where a resident of Australia is entitled to a tax credit in respect of adividend under paragraph (3) of this Article, tax may also be charged in Ireland and according to the laws of Ireland on the aggregate of the amount or value of that dividend and the amount of that tax credit at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent.

     (c)  Except as aforesaid, dividends paid by a company which is a resident ofIreland for the purposes of Irish tax, being dividends to which a resident of Australia is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from any tax in Ireland which is chargeable on dividends.

(3)   A resident of Australia who receives dividends from a company which is a resident of Ireland shall, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this Article and provided he is the beneficial owner of the dividends, be entitled to the tax credit in respect thereof to which an individual resident in Ireland would have been entitled had he received those dividends, and to the payment of any excess of that tax credit over his liability to Irish tax. Any such credit shall be treated for the purposes of Australian tax as assessable income from sources in   Ireland.

(4)   The provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article shall not apply where the beneficial owner of the dividends (being a company) is, or is associated with, a company which either alone or together with one or more associated companies controls directly or indirectly 10 per cent or more of the voting power in the company paying the dividends. For the purposes of this paragraph two companies shall be deemed to be associated if one controls directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the voting power in the other company, or a third company controls more than 50 per cent of the voting power in both of them.

(5)   The term dividends in this Article means income from shares and includes any income or distribution assimilated to income from shares under the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends or income or making the distribution is a resident.

(6)   Where the company paying a dividend is a resident of one of the Contracting States and the beneficial owner of the dividend, being a resident of the other Contracting State, owns 10 per cent or more of the class of shares in respect of which the dividend is paid, paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Article shall not apply to the dividend to the extent that it can have been paid only out of profits which the company paying the dividend earned or other income which it received in a period ending 12 months or more before the relevant date. For the purposes of this paragraph the term relevant date means the date on which the beneficial owner of the dividend became the owner of 10 per cent or more of the class of shares in question: provided that this paragraph shall not apply if the shares were acquired for bona fide commercial reasons and not primarily for the purpose of securing the benefit of this Article.

(7)   The provisions of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this Article shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 8 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.

(8)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base situated in that other State: provided that this paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of Ireland for the purposes of Irish tax.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 8 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political subdivision or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 8 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political subdivision or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned ammount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid or credited shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(5)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the interest is taxable in that other Contracting State according to its own law.

(6)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in one of the Contracting States when the payer is that State itself or a political or administrative subdivision of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in one of the Contracting States or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount.

PROTOCOL

The Government of Australia and

The Government of the Republic of Italy,

at the signing of the Convention between the two Governments for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, have agreed upon the following provisions which shall form an integral part of the Convention:

It is understood that:

(1)   With reference to Articles 7 and 9—

If the information available to the competent authority of one of the Contracting States is inadequate to determine the profits of an enterprise on which tax may be imposed in that State in accordance with Article 7 or Article 9 of the Convention, nothing in those Articles shall prevent the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles applicable under Articles 7 and 9.

(2)   With reference to paragraph (6) of Article 8—

The Italian taxes to which the Agreement therein referred to shall apply, with effect from the date of their entry into force, are the following—

                     (i)  the individual income tax (l’imposta sul reddito delle persone fisiche);

                    (ii)  the corporate income tax (l’imposta sul reddito delle persone giuridiche);

                     (iii)  the local income tax (l’imposta locale sui redditi).

If, in Australia, a tax (not being Australian tax referred to in Article 1 of the said Agreement) is imposed on profits derived by an enterprise of Italy from the operation of aircraft in international traffic, the taxes to which the Agreement shall apply in Italy shall thereupon cease to include the local income tax (l’imposta locale sui redditi).

(3)   With reference to Article 9—

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 9, an enterprise of one of the Contracting States may be taxed by that Contracting State as if that Article had not come into effect but, so far as it is practicable to do so, in accordance with the principles applicable under that Article.

(4)   With reference to Article 12—

The term ‘payments’ includes credits or any amount credited and a reference to royalties paid includes royalties credited. The term ‘royalties’ includes payments or credits for total or partial forbearance in respect of the use of a property or right referred to in paragraph (3).

(5)   With reference to Article 24—

The tax paid in respect of income by way of dividend in one of the Contracting States that is to be allowed as a credit against tax payable in respect of that income in the other Contracting State shall not include tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid.

(6)   With reference to paragraph (1) of Article 25—

The expression ‘notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws’ means that the mutual agreement procedure is not alternative to the national contentious proceedings which shall be, in any case, preventively initiated, when the claim is related to an assessment of Italian tax not in accordance with this Convention.

(7)   With reference to Article 28—

The provisions of paragraph (3) shall not prevent the Contracting States from carrying out other practices for the allowance of the taxation reductions provided for in this Convention.

(8)   If, in a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation that is subsequently made between Australia and a third State being a State that at the date of signature of this Protocol is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co--operation and Development, Australia shall agree to limit the rate of its taxation

                     (i)  on dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax to which a company that is a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 10; or

                    (ii)  on interest arising in Australia to which a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 11; or

                   (iii)  on royalties arising in Australia to which a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 12, the Government of Australia shall immediately inform the Government of the Republic of Italy in writing through the diplomatic channel and shall enter into negotiations with the Government of the Republic of Italy to review the provisions in sub--paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) above in order to provide the same treatment for Italy as that provided for the third State.

ARTICLE 6

<u>Income from Real Property</u>

(1)   Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from land (including any building or other construction) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in the other State.

A right to receive variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, oil or gas wells, quarries or other places of extraction or exploitation of natural resources shall be deemed to be an estate or direct interest in land situated in the Contracting State in which the mineral deposits, oil or gas wells, quarries or natural resources are situated.

(3)   The provisions of paragraph (1) shall also apply to the income from land of an enterprise and to income from land used for the performance of professional services.

ARTICLE 7

<u>Business Profits</u>

(1)   The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly indepenently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(5)   Where the correct amount of profits attributable to a permanent establishment is incapable of determination or the ascertaining thereof presents exceptional difficulties, nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of that State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(6)   Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

ARTICLE 8

<u>Ships and Aircraft</u>

(1)   Profits of a resident of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.

(2)   The provisions of paragraph (1) shall also apply to profits derived from participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.

ARTICLE 9

<u>Associated Enterprises</u>

(1)   Where a person subject to the taxing jurisdiction of a Contracting State and any other person are related and where conditions are operative between such related persons in their commercial or financial relations which are different from those which might be expected to operate if such persons were unrelated persons dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of those persons, but by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that person and taxed accordingly.

(2)   A person is related to another person for purposes of this Convention if either person participates directly or indirectly in the management, control, or capital of the other, or if any third person or persons participates or participate directly or indirectly in the management, control, or capital of both.

(3)   This Article shall apply only where both Contracting States have a tax interest.

(4)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, an enterprise of a Contracting State may be taxed by that State as if this Article had not come into effect but, so far as it is practicable to do so, in accordance with the principles of this Article.

(5)   Where profits on which an enterprise of a Contracting State has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1) or (4), in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention in relation to the nature of the income, and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

ARTICLE 10

<u>Dividends</u>

(1)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State, being dividends to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such dividends may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

(3)   The term ‘dividends’ in this Article means income from shares and other income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In any such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base situated in that other State. Provided that this paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which by reason of paragraph (1) of Article 4 is a resident of Australia and which by reason of that paragraph is also a resident of Korea.

(6)   Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the income of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, tax in addition to the taxes referred to in Article 2 in relation to the first--mentioned Contracting State which are payable by a company which is a resident of the first--mentioned State, provided that any such additional tax shall not exceed 15 per cent of the amount by which the taxable income of the first--mentioned company of a year of income exceeds the tax payable on that taxable income to the first--mentioned State. Any tax payable to a Contracting State on the undistributed profits of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State shall be calculated as if that company were not liable to the additional tax referred to in this paragraph and had paid dividends of such amount that tax equal to the amount of that additional tax would have been payable on the dividends in accordance with paragraph (2) of this Article.

ARTICLE 11

<u>Interest</u>

(1)   Interest arising in a Contracting State, being interest to which a resident of the other   Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such interest may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

(3)   Interest derived by the Government of a Contracting State or by any other body exercising governmental functions in or in a part of a Contracting State, or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State, shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting State.

(4)   The term ‘interest’ in this Article includes interest from Government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, and interest from any other form of indebtedness as well as all other income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

(5)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(6)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political or administrative subdivision of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who, by reason of paragraph (1) of Article 4 is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(7)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the taxpayer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the interest paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Convention.

ARTICLE 12

<u>Royalties</u>

(1)   Royalties arising in a Contracting State, being royalties to which a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other State.

(2)   Such royalties may be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

(3)   The term ‘royalties’ in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for—

     (a)  the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right;

     (b)  the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment;

     (c)  the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information;

     (d)  the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in paragraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in paragraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in paragraph (c);

     (e)  the use of, or the right to use—

              (iii)  tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting; or

      (f)  total or partial forberance in respect of the use of a property or right referred to in this paragraph.

(4)   The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political or administrative subdivision of that State or a local authority of that State or a person who, by reason of paragraph (1) of Article 4, is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the amount of the royalties paid shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, but subject to the other provisions of this Convention.

ARTICLE 13

<u>Alienation of Property</u>

(1)   Income from the alienation of real property may be taxed in the Contracting State in which that property is situated.

(2)   For the purposes of this Article—

     (a)  the term ‘real property’ shall include:

                (i)  a lease of land or any other direct interest in or over land;

               (ii)  rights to exploit, or to explore for, natural resources; and

              (iii)  shares or comparable interests in a company, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of direct interests in or over land in a Contracting State or of rights to exploit, or to explore for, natural resources in a Contracting State;

     (b)  real property shall be deemed to be situated—

CHAPTER IV

METHODS OF ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

ARTICLE 24

(1)   Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Korean tax paid under the law of Korea and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in Korea shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable on the income on which the Korean tax was paid. However, where the income is a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of Korea, the credit shall only take into account such tax in respect thereof as is additional to any tax payable by the company on the profits out of which the dividend is paid.

(2)   In the case of a resident of Korea, double taxation shall be avoided in accordance with this paragraph. Subject to the provisions of Korean tax law regarding the allowance as a credit against Korean tax of tax payable in any country other than Korea (which shall not affect the general principle hereof) Australian tax payable (excluding in the case of a dividend tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid) under the laws of Australia and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income from sources within Australia shall be allowed as a credit against Korean tax payable in respect of that income. The credit shall not, however, exceed that proportion of Korean tax which the income from sources within Australia bears to the entire income subject to Korean tax.

(3) (a)  For the purposes of paragraph (4), the term ‘Korean tax forgone’ means—

                (i)  in the case of interest derived by a resident of Australia which is exempted from Korean tax in accordance with the relevant legislation, the amount which, under the law of Korea and in accordance with this Convention, would have been payable as Korean tax if the interest had not been so exempt and if the tax referred to in paragraph (2) of Article 11 were not to exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest; and

               (ii)  in the case of royalties derived by a resident of Australia which are exempted either wholly or partly from Korean tax in accordance with the relevant legislation, the amount or, where the royalties are partly exempt, the additional amount which, under the law of Korea and in accordance with this Convention, would have been payable as Korean tax if the royalties had not been so wholly or partly exempt, and if the tax referred to in paragraph (2) of Article 12 were not to exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

     (b)  In sub--paragraph (a), the term ‘the relevant legislation’ means those provisions of the laws of Korea relating to Korean tax which are agreed in letters exchanged from time to time between the Minister of Finance of Korea and the Treasurer of Australia for the purposes of this paragraph.

(4) (a)  For the purposes of paragraph (1), an amount of Korean tax forgone shall be deemed to be an equivalent amount of Korean tax paid;

     (b)  For the purposes of the income tax law of Australia—

                (i)  an amount of interest referred to in sub--paragraph (3) (a) (i) shall be deemed to be increased by the amount of Korean tax forgone in respect of that interest; and

               (ii)  an amount of royalties referred to in sub--paragraph (3) (a) (ii) shall be deemed to be increased by the amount of Korean tax forgone in respect of those royalties.

(5)   Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply in relation to income derived in any year of income after the year of income that ends on 30 June in the calendar year fifth following the calendar year in which this Convention is signed or any later date that may be agreed by the Governments of the Contracting States in letters exchanged for this purpose.

CHAPTER V

SPECIAL PROVISIONS

ARTICLE 25

<u>Mutual Agreement Procedure</u>

(1)   Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.

(2)   The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting  State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any solution reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of the Contracting States.

(3)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall seek to resolve by agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application or interpretation of this Convention. In particular the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall seek to agree as to with which of the Contracting States an individual described in sub--paragraph (3) (b) of Article 4 has closer personal and economic relations or in which of the Contracting States the place of effective management of a person other than an individual described in paragraph (4) of that Article is situated.

(4)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Convention.

ARTICLE 26

<u>Exchange of Information</u>

(1)   The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning the taxes to which this Convention applies insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1\. Any information received by the competent authority of a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes to which this Convention applies and shall be used only for such purposes.

(2)   In no case shall the provisions of paragraph (1) be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation—

     (a)  to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (b)  to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (c)  to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or to supply information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.

ARTICLE 27

<u>Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers</u>

Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

CHAPTER VI

FINAL PROVISIONS

ARTICLE 28

<u>Entry Into Force</u>

(1)   Each Contracting  State shall notify the other by note through the diplomatic channel of the completion of the procedure required by its law for the bringing into force of this Convention. This Convention shall enter into force on the first day of the month second following the month in which the later of these notifications is given.

(2)   This Convention shall have effect:

This Convention shall remain in force indefinitely, but the Government of Australia or the Government of Korea may on or before 30 June in any calendar year after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force give to the other Government through the diplomatic channel written notice of termination and, in that event, this Convention shall cease to be effective:

     (a)  in Australia—

                (i)  in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non--resident, in relation to income derived on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given; and

<u>PROTOCOL</u>

THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA AND

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

HAVE AGREED AT THE SIGNING of the Convention between the two Governments for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income upon the following provisions which shall form an integral part of the said Convention.

            (1)   With reference to Article 2,

the Convention shall also apply to the Korean defence tax where charged by reference to the income tax or the corporation tax.

            (2)   With reference to Article 7,

the Convention shall not apply to profits of an enterprise from carrying on a business of any form of insurance, other than life insurance.

            (3)   With reference to paragraph (6) of Article 10,

the Governments of the Contracting States acknowledge that the additional tax referred to in that paragraph applicable at the time at which the Convention is signed is, in the case of Australia, only a tax of 5 per cent levied on the reduced taxable income of a company which is not a resident of Australia, in accordance with Section 128T of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

            (4)   With reference to paragraph (1) of Article 24,

the Governments of the Contracting States acknowledge that a company which is a resident of Australia is, in accordance with the provisions of the taxation law of Australia in force at the date of signature of the Convention, entitled to a rebate in its assessment at the average rate of tax payable by the company in respect of dividends that are included in its taxable income and are received from a company which is a resident of Korea. In the event that Australia should cease to allow a company which is a resident of Australia a rebate in its assessment at the average rate of tax payable by the company in respect of dividends derived from sources in Korea and included in the taxable income of the company, the Governments of the Contracting States will enter into negotiations in order to establish new provisions concerning the credit to be allowed by Australia against its tax on the dividends.

            (5)   With reference to paragraph (2) of Article 24,

if subsequently to the signature of the Convention Korea provides relief from its tax on intercorporate dividends, or in a convention with another country agrees to give credit for the tax of the other country on profits out of which dividends are paid to a resident of Korea, it shall immediately notify Australia and enter into negotiations in order to establish new provisions concerning the credit to be allowed by Korea against its tax on dividends.

            (6)   In general,

if in a convention for the avoidance of double taxation that is subsequently made between Australia and a third State Australia should agree—

          (a)     to reduce below 15 per cent the rate of its tax on dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia and to which a resident of the third State is beneficially entitled; or

          (b)     to include an Article dealing with non--discrimination,

the Government of Australia shall immediately inform the Government of Korea and shall enter into negotiations with the Government of Korea with a view to providing treatment in relation to Korea comparable with that provided in relation to that third State.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.

(b)        it furnishes services, including consultancy services, for the same or a connected project, through its employees or other personnel engaged for such purposes, within a Contracting State for a period or periods aggregating more than six months within any twelve month period; or

(c)        it maintains substantial equipment for rental or other purposes within that other State (excluding equipment let under a hire-purchase agreement) for more than six months; or

(d)        a person acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State manufactures or processes in the first-mentioned State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise.

4          (a)        The duration of activities under subparagraph 3(a) will be determined by aggregating the periods during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by associated enterprises provided that the activities of the enterprise in that State are substantially the same as the activities carried on in that State by its associate.

(b)        The period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities will be counted only once for the purpose of determining the duration of activities.

(c)        Under this Article, an enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if:

(i)         one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other; or

(ii)        both are controlled directly or indirectly by the same third person or persons.

5          Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, an enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment merely by reason of:

(a)     the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage or display of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; or

(b)     the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage or display; or

(c)     the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; or

(d)     the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or for collecting information, for the enterprise; or

(e)     the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

6          Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person—other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 7 applies—is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for that enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 5 and are, in relation to the enterprise, of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 

7          An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a person who is a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of the person's business as such a broker or agent.

8          The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself make either company a permanent establishment of the other.

9          The principles set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall be applied in determining for the purposes of this Convention whether there is a permanent establishment in a State other than one of the Contracting States and whether an enterprise other than an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States.

ARTICLE 6

Income from Real Property

1          Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from real property may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the real property is situated.

2          The term &quot;real property&quot;:

(a)        in the case of Australia, has the meaning which it has under the laws of Australia, and shall also include:

(i)         a lease of land and any other interest in or over land, whether improved or not, including a right to explore for mineral, oil or gas deposits or other natural resources, and a right to mine those deposits or resources; and

4          The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of real property.

5          The provisions of paragraphs 1, 3, and 4 shall also apply to income from real property of an enterprise.

ARTICLE 7

Business Profits

1          The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein.  If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

2          Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

3          In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

4          Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article.

5          No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

6          For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

7          Where profits include items of income or gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

8          Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law of a Contracting State relating to tax imposed on profits from insurance with non-residents provided that if the relevant law in force in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Convention is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

9          Where:

(a)        a resident of a Contracting State is beneficially entitled, whether directly or through one or more interposed trust estates, to a share of the business profits of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust estate other than a trust estate which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and

(b)        in relation to that enterprise, that trustee would, in accordance with the principles of Article 5, have a permanent establishment in that other State,

the enterprise carried on by the trustee shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and that share of business profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment.

ARTICLE 8

Shipping and Air Transport

1          Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.

2          Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft may be taxed in the other Contracting State to the extent that they are profits derived directly or indirectly from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that other State. 

3          The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits derived from the participation in a pool, a joint business or in an international operating agency.

4          For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that State shall be treated as profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that State.

5          The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply to profits derived by the joint Norwegian, Danish and Swedish air transport consortium Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), but only insofar as profits derived by SAS Norge AS, the Norwegian partner of the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), are in proportion to its share in that organisation.

ARTICLE 9

Associated Enterprises

1          Where:

(a)        an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or

(b)        the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2          Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits accruing to an enterprise, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article.

3          Where profits on which an enterprise of a Contracting State has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 1 or 2, in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and charged to tax in that other State, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first-mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first-mentioned State, if that State considers the adjustment justified.  In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

ARTICLE 10

Dividends

1          Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of its tax, being dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

2          However, those dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed:

(a)        5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, if the beneficial owner of those dividends is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and

(b)        15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases,

provided that if the relevant law in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Convention is varied otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character, the Contracting States shall consult each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

3          Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned shares representing 80 per cent or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for a twelve month period ending on the date the dividend is declared and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends:

(a)        has its principal class of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (o) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges;

(b)        is owned directly or indirectly by one or more companies whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (o) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges; or

(c)        does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph but the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State determines, in accordance with the law of that State, that the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations did not have as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of benefits under this Convention.  The competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State shall consult the competent authority of the other Contracting State before refusing to grant benefits of this Convention under this subparagraph.

4          The term &quot;dividends&quot; as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as other amounts which are subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax.

5          The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

6          Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company—being dividends beneficially owned by a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State—except insofar as the holding in respect of which such dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, even if the dividends paid consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. This paragraph shall not apply in relation to dividends paid by any company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of Norway for the purposes of Norwegian tax.

7          No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.

ARTICLE 11

Interest

1          Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2          However, that interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

3          Notwithstanding paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if:

(a)        the interest is derived from the investment of official reserve assets by the government of a Contracting State, its monetary institutions or a bank performing central banking functions in that State; or

(b)        the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer.  For the purposes of this Article, the term &quot;financial institution&quot; means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance.

4          Notwithstanding paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph (b) of that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if the interest is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans.

5          The term &quot;interest&quot; in this Article includes interest from government securities or from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage, interest from any other form of indebtedness, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the law of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

6          The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, subparagraph (b) of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.  In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

7          Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax.  Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

8          Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of that relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

9          No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.

ARTICLE 12

Royalties

1          Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2          However, those royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3          The term &quot;royalties&quot; in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for:

(a)        the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; or

(b)        the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information; or

(c)        the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (b); or

(d)        the use of, or the right to use:

(i)         motion picture films; or

(ii)        films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio or other broadcasting; or

(e)        the use of, or the right to use, some or all of the part of the radiofrequency spectrum specified in a spectrum licence; or

(f)        total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph.

4          The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5          Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6          Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.  In such case, the excess part of the amount of the payments or credits shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 

7          No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of rights in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.

ARTICLE 13

Alienation of Property

1          Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of real property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1          Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Norwegian tax paid under the law of Norway and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in Norway shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income.

2          Subject to the provisions of the laws of Norway regarding the allowance as a credit against Norwegian tax of tax payable in a territory outside Norway (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):

(a)        where a resident of Norway derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Australia, Norway shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the income tax paid in Australia on that income. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Australia.

(b)        where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived by a resident of Norway is exempt from tax in Norway, Norway may nevertheless include such income in the tax base, but shall allow as a deduction from the Norwegian tax on income that part of the Norwegian income tax which is attributable to the income derived from Australia.

ARTICLE 24

Non-discrimination

1          Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.

2          The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances.

3          Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 8 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.

4          Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected.

5          Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to individuals who are residents of the other Contracting State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to its own resident individuals.

6          This Article shall not apply to any provision of the law of a Contracting State which:

(a)        is designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes; or

(b)        does not permit the deferral of tax arising on the transfer of an asset where the subsequent transfer of the asset by the transferee would be beyond the taxing jurisdiction of the Contracting State under its laws; or

(c)        provides for consolidation of group entities for treatment as a single entity for tax purposes provided that a company, being a resident of that State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, may access such consolidation treatment on the same terms and conditions as other companies that are residents of the first-mentioned State; or

(d)        does not allow tax rebates or credits in relation to dividends paid by a company that is a resident of that State for purposes of its tax; or

(e)        provides deductions to eligible taxpayers for expenditure on research and development; or

(f)        is otherwise agreed to be unaffected by this Article in an Exchange of Notes between the Contracting States.

7          In this Article, provisions of the law of a Contracting State which are designed to prevent avoidance or evasion of taxes include:

(a)        measures designed to address thin capitalisation, dividend stripping and transfer pricing;

(b)        controlled foreign company, transferor trusts and foreign investment fund rules; and

(c)        measures designed to ensure that taxes can be effectively collected and recovered, including conservancy measures.

ARTICLE 25

Mutual Agreement Procedure

1          Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for the person in taxation not in accordance with this Convention, the person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States concerning taxes to which this Convention applies, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if the case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which the person is a national.  The case must be presented within 3 years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with this Convention.

2          The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Convention.  The solution so reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

3          The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention.  They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Convention.

4          The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

5          For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States.  Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of this Article or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.

ARTICLE 26

Exchange of Information

1          The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is forseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes referred to in Article 2, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1.  

2          Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

3          In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

(a)        to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; or

(b)        to supply information which is not obtainable by the competent authority under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; or

(c)        to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).

4          If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

5          In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.

ARTICLE 27

Assistance in the Collection of Taxes

1          The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Article 1\. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.

2          The term &quot;revenue claim&quot; as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes referred to in Article 2, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount. 

3          When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.

4          When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection. 

5          Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.

6          Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State. 

7          Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be:

(a)        in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection; or

(b)        in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection,

the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.

8          In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting  State the obligation:

(a)        to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; or

(b)        to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public); or

(c)        to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice; or

(d)        to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State; or

(e)        to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles.

ARTICLE 28

Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts

1          Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international agreements.

2          Insofar as, due to fiscal privileges granted to members of diplomatic missions and consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international agreements, income is not subject to tax in the receiving State, the right to tax shall be reserved to the sending State.

ARTICLE 29

Entry into Force

1          The Contracting States shall notify each other in writing through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their domestic requirements for the entry into force of this Convention.  

2          This Convention shall enter into force on the date of the last notification, and thereupon the Convention shall have effect:

(a)        in the case of Australia:

(i)         in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following the date on which the Convention enters into force;

(ii)        in respect of other Australian tax, in relation to income, profits or gains of any year of income beginning on or after 1 July in the calendar year next following the date on which the Convention enters into force;

(c)        for purposes of Article 26, from the date of entry into force of this Convention; and

(d)        for purposes of Article 27, from a date to be agreed in an exchange of notes through the diplomatic channel.

3          The Convention between Australia and the Kingdom of Norway for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital signed at Canberra on 6 May 1982, shall be terminated and shall cease to have effect from the dates on which this Convention becomes effective in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.

ARTICLE 30

Termination

            This Convention shall continue in effect indefinitely, but either Contracting State may terminate the Convention by giving written notice of termination, through the diplomatic channel, to the other State at least six months before the end of any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force and, in that event, the Convention shall cease to be effective:

(a)        in the case of Australia:

(i)         in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given;

(ii)        in respect of other Australian tax, in relation to income, profits or gains of any year of income beginning on or after 1 July in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given;

(5)   A person acting in one of the Contracting States on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State—other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph (6) applies—shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment of that enterprise in the first--mentioned State:

     (a)  in respect of his activities in that behalf, if he has, and habitually exercises in that State, an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to those mentioned in paragraph (3) and are such that, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make that fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph; or

(2)   Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment or with other enterprises with which it deals.

(3)   In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment (including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred) and which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent entity which paid those expenses, whether incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(4)   No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

(5)   Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including the determination of such liability by the exercise of a discretion or the making of an estimate by the competent authority of that State in cases in which, from the information available to the competent authority of that State, it is not possible or not practicable to ascertain the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, consistently with the principles of this Article.

(6)   For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

(7)   Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

(8)   Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law of a Contracting State relating to taxation of profits from insurance with non--residents provided that if the relevant law in force in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied (otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate.

ARTICLE 8

and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

(2)   Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including the determination of such liability by the exercise of a discretion or the making of an estimate by the competent authority of that State in cases in which, from the information available to the competent authority of that State, it is not possible or not practicable to determine the income to be attributed to an enterprise, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, consistently with the principles of this Article.

(3)   Where profits on which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has been charged to tax in that State are also included, by virtue of paragraph (1) or (2), in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly, and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then the first--mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first--mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement in relation to the nature of the income and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

In any such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States, being dividends to which a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State is beneficially entitled, shall be exempt from tax in that other State except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base situated in that other State.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

(5)   Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself or a political subdivision or local authority of that State or a person who is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in one of the Contracting States or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the interest, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, has in one of the Contracting States or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by the permanent establishment or fixed base, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(6)   Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the person beneficially entitled to the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the person so entitled in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last--mentioned amount.

CHAPTER IV

METHODS OF ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

ARTICLE 23

(1)   Subject to the provisions of the law of Australia from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Malta tax paid under the law of Malta and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Australia from sources in Malta (not including, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income.

(2)   A company which is a resident of Australia is, in accordance with the provisions of the taxation law of Australia in force at the date of signature of this Agreement, entitled to a rebate in its assessment at the average rate of tax payable by the company in respect of dividends that are included in its taxable income and are received from a company which is a resident of Malta. However, should the law so in force be amended so that the rebate in relation to the dividends ceases to be allowable under that law, Australia shall immediately advise Malta of the change and enter into negotiations with Malta in order to establish new provisions concerning the credit to be allowed by Australia against its tax on the dividends.

(3)   For the purposes of paragraph (1) and of the income tax law of Australia:

     (a)  a resident of Australia deriving income from sources in Malta consisting of dividends to which sub--paragraph (2) (b) (ii) of Article 10 applies, interest to which Article 11 applies or royalties to which Article 12 applies, being income in respect of which Malta tax has been wholly relieved or reduced for a limited period of time under the provisions of the Aids to Industries Ordinance 1959, so far as they were in force on, and have not been modified since, the date of signature of this Agreement, or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character, or under any other provisions which may subsequently be agreed by the Contracting States in letters exchanged for the purpose through the diplomatic channel to be of a substantially similar character, shall be deemed to have paid Malta tax in an amount, or the Malta tax paid shall be deemed to have been increased by an amount, equal to the amount by which the Malta tax that otherwise would have been payable (which tax, in the case of dividends, shall not exceed 15 per cent and, in the case of royalties or interest, 10 per cent of the gross amount thereof) is reduced by the exemption or reduction granted; and

     (b)  the amount of the said dividends, interest or royalties shall be deemed to be the amount that would have been the amount of the dividends, interest or royalties if no Malta tax had been paid, increased by the amount by which the tax that otherwise would have been payable is reduced by the said exemption or reduction.

(4)   Paragraph (3) shall not apply in relation to income derived in any year of income after the year of income that ends on 30 June 1989 or on any later date that may be agreed by the Contracting States in letters exchanged for this purpose.

(5) (a)  Subject to the provisions of the law of Malta from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Malta tax of tax paid in a country outside Malta (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Australian tax paid under the law of Australia and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Malta from sources in Australia (not including, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against Malta tax payable in respect of that income.

     (b)  Where a company which is a resident of Australia pays a dividend to a company which is a resident of Malta and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the first--mentioned company, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any Australian tax for which credit may be allowed under sub--paragraph (a)) the Australian tax payable by that first--mentioned company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid.

(6)   Where under this Agreement income is to be relieved from tax in one of the Contracting States and, under the law in force in the other Contracting State, a person, in respect of the said income, is subject to tax by reference to the amount thereof which is remitted to or received in that other State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the relief to be allowed under this Agreement in the first--mentioned State shall apply only to so much of the income as is remitted to or received in the other State.

The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action giving rise to taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

(2)   The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with this Agreement.

(2)   In no case shall the provisions of paragraph (1) be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

     (a)  to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

     (b)  to supply particulars which are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

(2)   Notwithstanding Article 4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of one of the Contracting States which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of this Agreement to be a resident of the sending State if he is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on his total income as are residents of that sending State.

(3)   This Agreement shall not apply to International Organizations, to organs or officials thereof or to persons who are members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a third State, being present in a Contracting State and who are not liable in either Contracting State to the same obligations in relation to tax on their total income as are residents thereof.
