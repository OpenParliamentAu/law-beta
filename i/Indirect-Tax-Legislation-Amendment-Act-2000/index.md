                     (a)  whether acquisitions or importations by a member are for a * creditable purpose; and

                     (b)  the amounts of any input tax credits to which the member is entitled; and

                   An entity (the **_principal_**) may, in writing, enter into an arrangement with another entity (the **_agent_**) under which:

                     (a)  the agent will, on the principal’s behalf:

                              (i)  make supplies to third parties; or

                             (ii)  make acquisitions from third parties; or

                            (iii)  make both supplies to third parties and acquisitions from third parties; and

                     (b)  the kinds of supplies or acquisitions, or the kinds of supplies and acquisitions, to which the arrangement applies are specified; and

                     (c)  for the purposes of the GST law:

                              (i)  the agent will be treated as making the supplies to the third parties, or acquisitions from the third parties, or both; and

                             (ii)  the principal will be treated as making corresponding supplies to the agent, or corresponding acquisitions from the agent, or both; and

                     (d)  in the case of supplies to third parties:

                              (i)  the agent will issue to the third parties, in the agent’s own name, all the * tax invoices and * adjustment notes relating to those supplies; and

                             (ii)  the principal will not issue to the third parties any tax invoices and adjustment notes relating to those supplies; and

                     (e)  the arrangement ceases to have effect if the principal or the agent, or both of them, cease to be * registered.

##### <a id="153-55"></a>153-55  The effect of these arrangements on supplies

             (1)  A * taxable supply that the principal makes to a third party through the agent is taken to be a supply that is a taxable supply made by the agent to the third party, and not by the principal, if:

                     (a)  the supply is of a kind to which the arrangement applies; and

                     (b)  the supply is made in accordance with the arrangement; and

                     (c)  both the principal and the agent are * registered.

             (2)  In addition, the principal is taken to make a supply that is a * taxable supply to the agent. This supply is taken:

                     (a)  to be a supply of the same thing as is supplied in the taxable supply (the **_agent’s supply_**) that the agent is taken to make; and

                     (b)  to have a * value equal to 10/11 of the amount that is payable to the principal by the agent in respect of the agent’s supply.

The agent is taken to make a corresponding * creditable acquisition from the principal.

             (3)  If the principal pays, or is liable to pay, an amount, as a commission or similar payment, to the agent for the agent’s supply to the third party:

                     (a)  for the purpose of paragraph (2)(b), the amount payable by the agent to the principal is taken to be reduced by the amount the principal pays, or is liable to pay, to the agent; and

                     (b)  the supply by the agent to the principal, to which the principal’s payment or liability relates, is not a * taxable supply.

             (4)  However, this section no longer applies, and is taken never to have applied, if the principal issues to the third party, in the principal’s own name, any * tax invoice or * adjustment note relating to the supply.

             (5)  This section has effect despite section 9-5 (which is about what are taxable supplies), section 9-75 (which is about the value of taxable supplies) and section 11-5 (which is about what are creditable acquisitions).

##### <a id="153-60"></a>153-60  The effect of these arrangements on acquisitions

             (1)  An acquisition that the principal makes from a third party through the agent is taken to be a * creditable acquisition made by the agent from the third party, and not by the principal, if:

                     (a)  the acquisition is of a kind to which the arrangement applies; and

                     (b)  the acquisition is made in accordance with the arrangement; and

                     (c)  both the principal and the agent are * registered.

             (2)  In addition, the agent is taken to make a supply that is a * taxable supply to the principal. This supply is taken:

                     (a)  to be a supply of the same thing as is acquired in the * creditable acquisition (the **_agent’s acquisition_**) that the agent is taken to make; and

                     (b)  to have a * value equal to 10/11 of the amount that is payable to the agent by the principal in respect of the agent’s acquisition.

One taxable supply recorded on an invoice

             (1)  If the amount of GST on a * taxable supply that is the only taxable supply recorded on a particular * invoice would, apart from this section, be an amount that includes a fraction of a cent, the amount of GST is rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).

Several taxable supplies recorded on an invoice

             (2)  If 2 or more * taxable supplies are recorded on the same * invoice, the total amount of GST on the supplies is:

                     (a)  what would be the amount of GST if it were worked out by:

                              (i)  working out the GST on each of the supplies (without rounding the amounts to the nearest cent); and

                             (ii)  adding the amounts together and, if the total is an amount that includes a fraction of a cent, rounding it to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards); or

* * *

_Method statement_

_Step 1._ Work out, for each * taxable supply, what would, apart from this section, be the amount of GST on the supply.

_Step 2._ If the amount for the supply has more decimal places than the number of decimal places allowed by the accounting system used to work out the amount, round the amount (up or down as appropriate) to that number of decimal places.

                   Note:             Subsection (4) gives further details of this rounding.

_Step 3._ Work out the sum of the amounts worked out under step 1 and (if applicable) step 2 for each supply.

_Step 4._ If the sum under step 3 includes a fraction of a cent, round the sum to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5 cents upwards).

* * *

             (3)  Whether to use paragraph (2)(a) or paragraph (2)(b) to work out the total amount of GST on the supplies is a matter of choice for:

                     (a)  the supplier if the amount is being worked out to ascertain the supplier’s liability for GST; or

                     (b)  the * recipient of the supplies if the amount is being worked out to ascertain the recipient’s entitlement to input tax credits.

             (4)  In applying step 2 of the method statement in subsection (2), if:

                     (a)  the number of decimal places in the amount for the supply exceeds by one decimal place the number of decimal places allowed by the accounting system used to work out the amount; and

                     (b)  the last digit of the amount (before rounding) is 5;

the amount is rounded upwards to that number of decimal places.

Taxable supplies divided into items

                     (a)  subsection (1) does not apply; and

Note:          Choosing to use section 17-5 to work out your net amount does not mean your GST return is not in the approved form: see subsection 31-15(3).

                     (b)  not in the way specified in the * approved form for a GST return;

Note:          Credit ground CR9 is producer rebates.

##### <a id="19-5"></a>19-5  Entitlement to producer rebates

             (2)  A sale of wine by mail order or on the Internet is taken to be a sale from particular premises for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c) if the wine is sold under the * producer’s licence to which those premises relate.

AOUs

             (3)  You are also entitled to a * producer rebate for * rebatable wine in respect of a * financial year if:

                     (a)  you are the * producer of the wine; and

                     (b)  you are liable to wine tax for an * AOU of the wine during the financial year.

##### 6A  Trading periods spanning midnight on 30 June 2000

             (1)  Despite section 6, if:

                     (a)  an entity has chosen to apply this section; and

                     (b)  the entity makes a supply that, under section 6, would be taken to be made on 1 July 2000 but before:

                              (i)  6 am on that day; or

                             (ii)  if the entity has chosen to stop the application of this section at an earlier time on that day—the time so chosen; and

                     (c)  the part of the entity’s enterprise through which the supply is made was open for business both immediately before 1 July 2000 and immediately after 30 June 2000; and

the supply, and the acquisition made by the recipient of the supply, is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be made immediately before 1 July 2000.

             (2)  If an entity makes a supply to which subsection (1) applies, then, in relation to that supply:

                     (a)  section 12 has effect as if the reference in paragraph 12(1)(b) to a period that begins before 1 July 2000 and ends on or after 1 July 2000 were a reference to a period that begins before the end of the transition trading period and ends on or after the end of the transition trading period; and

                     (d)  paragraph 17(1)(b) has effect as if the reference to applying the goods on or after 1 July 2000 were a reference to applying the goods after the end of the transition trading period; and

                     (e)  paragraph 17(3)(b) has effect as if the reference to ceasing to be registered on or after 1 July 2000 were a reference to ceasing to be registered after the end of the transition trading period; and

                              (i)  the reference to making gambling supplies before 1 July 2000 were a reference to making gambling supplies before the end of the transition trading period; and

                             (ii)  the reference to a gambling event happening on or after 1 July 2000 were a reference to a gambling event happening on or after the end of the transition trading period; and

                            (iii)  the references to gambling events that happened before 1 July 2000 were references to gambling events that happened before the end of the transition trading period; and

                     (g)  section 24A has effect as if the references to vouchers supplied before, not redeemed before, or supplied after, 1 July 2000 were references to vouchers supplied before, not redeemed before, or supplied after, the end of the transition trading period (as the case requires).

             (3)  This section does not apply if, but for this section, the supply would be input taxed.

             (4)  In this section:

                    <a name="transition-trade-period"></a>**_transition trading period_** means the period ending:

                     (a)  at the first time after 30 June 2000 that the part of the entity’s enterprise through which the supply in question was made was not open for business; or

                              (i)  6 am on 1 July 2000; or

                             (ii)  if the entity has chosen to stop the application of this section at an earlier time on that day—the time so chosen;

whichever occurs sooner.

### Division 139—Distributions from deceased estates  

##### <a id="139-1"></a>139-1  What this Division is about

* * *

Distributions from deceased estates, for private consumption, that are not taxable supplies may involve disposing of assets that were acquired or imported in circumstances giving rise to entitlements to input tax credits. This Division provides for an increasing adjustment to cancel those input tax credits.

* * *

##### <a id="139-5"></a>139-5  Adjustments for distributions from deceased estates

             (1)  You have an **_increasing adjustment_** if:

                     (a)  you are the executor or trustee of a deceased estate; and

                     (b)  you are * registered or * required to be registered; and

                     (c)  you supply an asset of the deceased estate to a beneficiary of the deceased estate; and

                     (d)  the supply is not a * taxable supply and is not a supply that is * GST-free or * input taxed; and

                     (e)  you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person’s acquisition or importation of the asset.

Note:          Increasing adjustments increase your net amounts.

             (2)  The amount of the adjustment, for the asset, is as follows:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006C00496/Html/IndirectTaxLegAmendAct2000_image005.gif)

where:

                    <a name="applic-valu"></a>**_applicable value_** is:

                     (a)  the * GST inclusive market value of the asset immediately before it is supplied; or

                     (b)  if you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person acquiring the thing—the amount of the * consideration that you or the deceased person provided, or was liable to provide, for the acquisition of the thing, but only if the amount is less than that value; or

                     (c)  if you were, or are, or the deceased person was, entitled to an input tax credit for the deceased person importing the thing—the cost to you or the deceased person of acquiring or producing the thing (plus the GST paid on its importation), but only if the amount is less than that value.

             (3)  However, an * adjustment does not arise under this section in respect of the asset if:

                     (a)  the asset related to an * enterprise that the deceased person * carried on, and the beneficiary intends to continue to carry on that enterprise; or

                     (b)  there were one or more * adjustment periods for the deceased person’s acquisition or importation of the asset, and the last of those adjustment periods has ended before the cancellation of your * registration takes effect.

##### 139-10  Attributing adjustments for distributions from deceased estates

             (1)  An * adjustment that you have under this Division is attributable to the tax period in which it arises.

             (2)  This section has effect despite section 29-20 (which is about attributing your adjustments).

##### <a id="139-15"></a>139-15  Application of Division 129

##### <a id="188-32"></a>188-32  The value of gambling supplies
