**Table of sections**

4‑1            Application of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_

4‑10          Temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy

##### <a id="4‑1"></a>4‑1  Application of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_

                   The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, as originally enacted, applies to assessments for the 1997‑98 income year and later income years.

Note:          For the application of amendments of that Act (including new provisions inserted in it), see the Acts making the amendments.

##### <a id="4‑10"></a>4‑10  Temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy

Temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy

             (1)  You must pay extra income tax (**_temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy_**) for the 2011‑12 financial year if:

                     (a)  you are an individual; and

                     (b)  your taxable income for the 2011‑12 income year exceeds $50,000.

Note:          This section will also affect the income tax payable by some trustees who are taxed as if certain trust income were income of individuals. See sections 98 and 99 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if you are a member of a class of individuals specified in a legislative instrument made by the Minister for the purposes of this subsection.

             (3)  The Minister may only specify a class of individuals for the purposes of subsection (2) if the Minister is satisfied that the class was affected by a natural disaster that happened in Australia between:

                     (a)  1 July 2010; and

                     (b)  30 June 2012.

Amount of temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy

             (4)  Your temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy is worked out by reference to your taxable income for the 2011‑12 income year, using the rate or rates that apply to you.

Note:          See section 12B of the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_.

Interaction with other provisions

             (5)  For the purpose of working out your income tax for the 2011‑12 financial year, subsection 4‑10(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if it stated that your income tax for the financial year is the total of:

                     (a)  the amount worked out using the method statement in that subsection; and

                     (b)  the amount of any extra tax you must pay as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section.

             (6)  To avoid doubt, temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy is not included in your basic income tax liability worked out in accordance with step 2 of the method statement in subsection 4‑10(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          You cannot apply any tax offsets against temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy under Part 2‑20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, because temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy is not included in your basic income tax liability.

             (7)  Disregard this section for the purposes of section 770‑75 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (Foreign income tax offset limit).

                     (a)  apart from that rule, you could otherwise deduct amounts under Division 41 of that Act for that income year; and

                     (b)  the total of those amounts is more than or equal to the excess worked out under that subsection for the business activity for the income year.

##### <a id="36‑100"></a>36‑100  Tax losses for the 1997‑98 and later income years 

                   To work out your **_tax loss_** (if any) for the 1997‑98 income year or a later income year, apply the provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ about tax losses.

Start at Division 36 of that Act.

##### <a id="36‑105"></a>36‑105  Tax losses for 1989‑90 to 1996‑97 income years

             (1)  If you incurred a loss for the purposes of section 79E (General domestic losses of 1989‑90 to 1996‑97 years of income) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in any of the 1989‑90 to 1996‑97 income years, the loss is your **_tax loss_** for that income year, which is called a **_loss year_**.

             (2)  You can deduct the tax loss in the 1997‑98 or a later income year only to the extent that it has not already been deducted.

##### <a id="36‑110"></a>36‑110  Tax losses for 1957‑58 to 1988‑89 income years

             (1)  If you incurred a loss for the purposes of section 80AA (Primary production losses of pre‑1990 years of income) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in any of the 1957‑58 to 1988‑89 income years, the loss is your **_tax loss_** for that income year, which is called a **_loss year_**. The loss is also called a **_primary production loss_**.

             (2)  You can deduct the tax loss in the 1997‑98 or a later income year only to the extent that it has not already been deducted. 

             (3)  You deduct your primary production losses (in the order in which you incurred them) before any other tax losses of the same or any other loss year, except film losses.

             (4)  A company cannot transfer any amount of a primary production loss for the 1983‑84 or an earlier income year under Subdivision 170‑A (Transfer of tax losses within wholly‑owned groups of companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_. 

             (5)  For the purposes of determining how much (if any) of a primary production loss you can deduct in the 1997‑98 or a later income year, subsections 80AA(9), (10) and (11) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ apply in the same way as they apply for the purposes they refer to.

##### <a id="40‑10"></a>40‑10  Plant

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you have deducted or can deduct amounts for plant under Division 42 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_former Act_**) as in force just before it was amended by the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Act 2001_ and the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances—Transitional and Consequential) Act 2001_, or you could have deducted amounts under that Division for the plant if you had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day; and

                     (b)  either:

                              (i)  you hold the plant at 1 July 2001; or

                             (ii)  subparagraph (i) does not apply and you were the owner or quasi‑owner of the plant at the end of  30 June 2001.

             (2)  Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as amended by the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Act 2001_ and the _New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances—Transitional and Consequential) Act 2001_ (the **_new Act_**) applies to the plant on this basis:

                     (a)  the amount that was your undeducted cost at the end of 30 June 2001 becomes the plant’s opening adjustable value; and

                     (b)  you use the same cost, effective life and method that you were using under Division 42 of the former Act, or that you would have used if you had used the plant for the purpose of producing assessable income at the end of 30 June 2001; and

                     (c)  if you excluded an amount from your assessable income under section 42‑290 of the former Act for a balancing adjustment event that occurred on or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999—the cost of the plant, and its opening adjustable value, are reduced by that amount; and

                     (d)  if subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) applies to you—you are treated as the holder of the plant while you are its holder or while the circumstances under which you would have been the owner or quasi‑owner of the plant under the former Act continue.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

             (3)  If you were using a rate for the plant under subsection 42‑160(1) or 42‑165(1) of the former Act just before 1 July 2001, or would have been using such a rate if you had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day, Division 40 of the new Act applies to the plant on this basis:

                     (a)  for the diminishing value method—replace the component in the formula in subsection 40‑70(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate you were using; and

                     (b)  for the prime cost method:

                              (i)  replace the component in the formula in subsection 40‑75(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate you were using; and

                             (ii)  increase the plant’s cost under Division 42 of the former Act by any amounts included in the second element of the plant’s cost after 30 June 2001.

Note 1:       Recalculating effective life will have no practical effect for an entity to whom subsection (3) applies because the component in the relevant formula that relies on effective life has been replaced.

Note 2:       Small business entities can choose to work out the decline in value of their depreciating assets under Division 328.

##### <a id="40‑12"></a>40‑12  Plant acquired after 30 June 2001

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you entered into a contract to acquire an item of plant before 1 July 2001 and you acquired it after 30 June 2001; or

                     (b)  you started to construct an item of plant before 1 July 2001 and you complete its construction after 30 June 2001.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the plant.

             (3)  If you entered into the contract, or started to construct the plant, at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999, you replace the component in the formula in subsection 40‑70(1) or 40‑75(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate you would have been using if you had acquired it, or completed its construction, before 1 July 2001 and had used it, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day.

##### <a id="40‑13"></a>40‑13  Accelerated depreciation for split or merged plant

             (1)  This section applies to a depreciating asset that is plant if:

                     (a)  you entered into a contract to acquire the plant, you otherwise acquired it or you started to construct it before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; and

                     (b)  you held it at the end of 30 June 2001; and

                     (c)  on or after 1 July 2001:

                              (i)  the plant is split into 2 or more depreciating assets; or

                             (ii)  the plant is merged into another depreciating asset.

             (2)  For a case where the plant is split into 2 or more depreciating assets, the new Act applies as if you had acquired the assets into which it is split before the time mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) while you continue to hold those assets.

             (3)  For a case where the plant is merged into another depreciating asset, section 40‑125 of the new Act does not apply to the asset, or to your interest in the asset, into which it is merged while you continue to hold it.

##### <a id="40‑15"></a>40‑15  Recalculating effective life

                   You cannot recalculate the effective life of a depreciating asset for which:

                     (a)  you were using, just before 1 July 2001, a rate under subsection 42‑160(1) or 42‑165(1) of the former Act; or

                     (b)  you would have been using such a rate if you had used the asset, or had it installed ready for use, for the purpose of producing assessable income before that day.

##### <a id="40‑20"></a>40‑20  IRUs

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you have deducted or can deduct an amount for an IRU under Division 44 of the former Act or you would have been able to deduct an amount for it under that Division if you had used it for the purpose of producing assessable income before 1 July 2001; and

                     (b)  you hold the IRU at 1 July 2001.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the IRU on this basis:

                     (a)  you use the cost, effective life and method you were using under Division 44 of the former Act or that you would have used if you had used the IRU for the purpose of producing assessable income before 1 July 2001; and

                     (b)  the amount that was your undeducted cost of the IRU at the end of 30 June 2001 becomes the IRU’s opening adjustable value.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

##### <a id="40‑25"></a>40‑25  Software

             (1)  Despite its repeal by this Act, Division 46 of the former Act continues to apply to expenditure on software that you incurred and that was in a software pool under that Division at the end of 30 June 2001.

             (2)  For a unit of software for which you were deducting amounts under Subdivision 46‑B of the former Act or for which you could have deducted amounts under that Subdivision if you had used the software for the purpose of producing assessable income before 1 July 2001, Division 40 of the new Act applies to the unit on this basis:

                     (a)  its cost is the amount of expenditure you incurred on the unit; and

                     (b)  you must use the prime cost method; and

                     (c)  its opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 is its undeducted cost at the end of 30 June 2001; and

                     (d)  you must use the same effective life you were using under Subdivision 46‑B of the former Act or that you would have used if you had used the software for the purpose of producing assessable income before 1 July 2001.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

##### <a id="40‑30"></a>40‑30  Spectrum licences

             (1)  This section applies to you if you have deducted or can deduct an amount under Division 380 of the former Act for expenditure incurred in obtaining a spectrum licence on or before 30 June 2001 or you could have deducted an amount under that Division for that expenditure if you had used the licence for the purpose of producing assessable income on or before that day.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the spectrum licence on this basis:

                     (a)  its cost is your expenditure incurred in obtaining the licence; and

                     (b)  its opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 is the amount of unrecouped expenditure for the licence at the end of 30 June 2001; and

                     (c)  its effective life is the same as it had under the former Act; and

                     (d)  you must use the prime cost method.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

##### <a id="40‑33"></a>40‑33  Datacasting transmitter licences

             (1)  This section applies to you if you hold a datacasting transmitter licence at 1 July 2001.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the licence on this basis:

                     (a)  its cost is your expenditure incurred in obtaining the licence; and

                     (b)  its opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 is its cost; and

                     (c)  its effective life is 15 years less any period that has elapsed from the day the licence was issued until 1 July 2001; and

                     (d)  you must use the prime cost method.

##### <a id="40‑35"></a>40‑35  Mining unrecouped expenditure

             (1)  This section applies to you if you have an amount of unrecouped expenditure under Division 330 of the former Act at the end of 30 June 2001.

Note:          Subsection (6) also applies to a case where you did not have unrecouped expenditure at 30 June 2001: see subsection (8).

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the expenditure as if it were a depreciating asset (the **_notional asset_**) you hold on this basis:

                     (a)  it has an opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 equal to the amount of unrecouped expenditure reduced by any deductions allowable under section 330‑80 of the former Act for your income year ending on 30 June 2001; and

                     (b)  it has a cost equal to the total amount of allowable capital expenditure under the former Act; and

                     (c)  in applying the formula in section 40‑75 of the new Act for the income year in which 1 July 2001 occurs—you use the adjustments in subsection 40‑75(3) of the new Act; and

                     (d)  it is taken to have been used for a taxable purpose at the start of 1 July 2001; and

                     (e)  it has a remaining effective life worked out under subsection (3); and

                      (f)  you must use the prime cost method.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

             (3)  The remaining effective life of the notional asset at the start of an income year (**_present income year_**) for which you are working out its decline in value is:

                     (a)  for an amount of unrecouped expenditure in respect of expenditure incurred in carrying on eligible mining operations other than in the course of petroleum mining is the lesser of these:

                              (i)  the number equal to the difference between 10 and the number of income years (which may be zero) before the present income year for which an amount in respect of expenditure was deductible;

                             (ii)  the number equal to the number of whole years in the estimated life of the mine, or proposed mine, on the mining property, or, if there is more than one such mine, of the mine that has the longest estimated life, as at the end of the present income year; or

                     (b)  for an amount of unrecouped expenditure in respect of expenditure incurred in carrying on eligible mining operations in the course of petroleum mining is the lesser of these:

                              (i)  the number equal to the difference between 10 and the number of income years (which may be zero) before the present income year for which an amount in respect of expenditure was deductible;

                             (ii)  the number equal to the number of whole years in the estimated life of the petroleum field or proposed petroleum field as at the end of the present income year; or

                     (c)  for an amount of unrecouped expenditure in respect of expenditure incurred in carrying on eligible quarrying operations the lesser of these:

                              (i)  the number equal to the difference between 20 and the number of income years (which may be zero) before the present income year for which an amount in respect of expenditure was deductible; and 

                             (ii)  the number equal to the number of whole years in the estimated life of the quarry, or proposed quarry, on the quarrying property, or, if there is more than one such quarry, of the quarry that has the longest estimated life, as at the end of the present income year.

             (4)  Sections 40‑95 and 40‑110 of the new Act do not apply to the unrecouped expenditure.

             (5)  If either:

                     (a)  both of these subparagraphs apply:

                              (i)  any of the unrecouped expenditure referred to in subsection (1) relates to a depreciating asset (the **_real asset_**);

                             (ii)  in an income year (the **_cessation year_**) you stop holding the real asset, or stop using it for a taxable purpose; or

                     (b)  both of these subparagraphs apply:

                              (i)  any of the unrecouped expenditure referred to in subsection (1) relates to property that is not a depreciating asset (the **_other property_**);

                             (ii)  in the cessation year, the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose;

there is an additional decline in value of the notional asset for the cessation year equal to so much of the notional asset’s adjustable value as relates to the real asset or the other property and has not been taken into account in working out the amount of a balancing adjustment in relation to the real asset.

             (6)  If the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose, you must include in your assessable income:

                     (a)  if the other property is sold for a price specific to that property—that price, less the expenses of the sale (to the extent the expenses are reasonably attributable to selling that particular property); or

                     (b)  if the other property is sold with additional property without a specific price being allocated to it—the part of the total sale price, less the reasonably attributable expenses of the sale, that is reasonably attributable to selling the other property; or

                     (c)  if the other property is lost or destroyed—the amount or value received or receivable under an insurance policy or otherwise for the loss or destruction; or

                     (d)  if you own the other property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose—its market value at that time; or

                     (e)  if you do not own the property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose—a reasonable amount.

However, the amount included is reduced to the extent (if any) that it is also included under subsection 40‑830(6) of the new Act.

             (7)  If section 40‑115 of the new Act applies, or section 40‑125 of the new Act would, apart from this subsection, apply, to the real asset referred to in subsection (5) of this section, then:

                     (a)  if the real asset is split into 2 or more depreciating assets and you stop holding, or stop using for a taxable purpose, one or more but not all of the assets into which it is split—subsection (5) does not apply to that asset or assets into which it is split that you continue to hold and continue to use for a taxable purpose; or

                     (b)  if the real asset is merged into another depreciating asset—section 40‑125 does not apply to the asset into which it is merged while you continue to hold it.

             (8)  Subsection (6) also applies to a case where:

                     (a)  you did not have an amount of unrecouped expenditure under Division 330 of the former Act at the end of 30 June 2001, but you had an amount of unrecouped expenditure under that Division before 30 June 2001; and

                     (b)  that expenditure relates to property that is not a depreciating asset (the **_other property_**); and

                     (c)  after that day, the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose.

                     (c)  the expenditure does not relate to a depreciating asset.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the expenditure as if it were a depreciating asset (the **_notional asset_**) you hold on this basis:

                     (a)  it has a cost at the time you incur the expenditure equal to the amount of the expenditure; and

                     (b)  in applying the formula in section 40‑75 of the new Act for the income year in which you incur the expenditure—you use the adjustments in subsection 40‑75(3) of the new Act; and

                     (b)  in an income year (the **_cessation year_**), the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose;

there is an additional decline in value of the notional asset for the cessation year equal to so much of the notional asset’s adjustable value as relates to the other property.

             (6)  If the other property is disposed of, lost or destroyed, or you stop using it for a taxable purpose, you must include in your assessable income:

                     (d)  if you own the other property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose—its market value at that time; or

                     (e)  if you do not own the property and you stop using it for a taxable purpose—a reasonable amount.

However, the amount included is reduced to the extent (if any) that it is also included under subsection 40‑830(6) of the new Act.

                     (b)  in an income year (the **_cessation year_**) you stop holding the real asset, or stop using it for a taxable purpose;

there is an additional decline in value of the notional asset for the cessation year equal to so much of the notional asset’s adjustable value as relates to the real asset and has not been taken into account in working out the amount of a balancing adjustment in relation to the real asset.

             (6)  If section 40‑115 of the new Act applies, or section 40‑125 of the new Act would, apart from this subsection, apply, to the real asset referred to in subsection (5) of this section, then:

                     (c)  its cost is the qualifying amount; and

                     (d)  it has an effective life equal to the remaining life you last estimated for it under the former Act; and

                     (e)  you can recalculate its effective life if you conclude that your estimate is no longer accurate (except that the effective life cannot exceed 25 years); and

                      (f)  you must use the prime cost method.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

##### <a id="40‑55"></a>40‑55  Environmental impact assessment

             (1)  This section applies to you if you have deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 400‑A of the former Act for an amount (the **_qualifying amount_**) of expenditure on or before  30 June 2001 on evaluating the impact on the environment of a project under Subdivision 400‑A of the former Act.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the qualifying amount as if it were a depreciating asset on this basis:

                     (a)  it has an opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 equal to the qualifying amount less any amounts you have deducted or can deduct for it under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  it has a cost equal to the qualifying amount; and

                     (c)  it has an effective life equal to the number of years for which you could deduct for the qualifying amount worked out under subsection 400‑15(3) of the former Act; and

                     (d)  you must use the prime cost method.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

##### <a id="40‑60"></a>40‑60  Pooling under Subdivision 42‑L of the former Act

             (1)  Units of plant that you had allocated to a pool under Subdivision 42‑L of the former Act and that were allocated to the pool by 30 June 2001 are treated as a single depreciating asset for the purposes of Division 40 of the new Act.

             (2)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to the single depreciating asset on this basis:

                     (a)  its cost and opening adjustable value at 1 July 2001 is the closing balance of the pool for your income year in which 30 June 2001 occurred; and

                     (b)  you must use the diminishing value method; and

                     (c)  in applying the formula in section 40‑70 of the new Act for your income year in which 1 July 2001 occurs—it has a base value equal to that opening adjustable value; and

                     (d)  you replace the component in the formula in subsection 40‑70(1) of the new Act that includes an asset’s effective life with the pool percentage you were using for the pool; and

                     (e)  if an item of plant is removed from the pool because a balancing adjustment event occurs for the item or because of subsection (3) of this section, section 40‑115 of the new Act applies so that you are treated as having split the single depreciating asset into the removed asset and the remaining assets in the pool; and

                      (f)  if an amount is included in the second element of the cost of a depreciating asset in the pool, Division 40 of the new Act applies as if that amount had been included in the second element of the cost of the single asset.

Note:          There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

             (3)  An item of plant in the pool is automatically removed from the pool if you stop using it wholly for taxable purposes (except because a balancing adjustment event occurs for the item).

Note 1:       You work out the decline in value of an item removed under this subsection under Subdivision 40‑B of the new Act, using the cost for it worked out under section 40‑205 of the new Act.

Note 2:       There are special rules for entities that have substituted accounting periods: see section 40‑65.

##### <a id="40‑65"></a>40‑65  Substituted accounting periods

             (1)  This section sets out special rules for the application of Division 40 of the new Act to an entity that:

                     (a)  has a substituted accounting period; and

                     (b)  because of a provision of this Subdivision, uses Division 40 of the new Act to work out the decline in value of an asset, or of something that is treated as an asset.

             (2)  The entity works out its deductions for its income year that includes 1 July 2001 (the **_calculation year_**) in this way:

                     (a)  the entity works out its deductions for that asset under the former Act as from the start of its calculation year up to the end of 30 June 2001 as if that period were an income year; and

                     (b)  the entity works out the decline in value of the asset under Division 40 of the new Act from 1 July 2001 until the end of its calculation year as if that period were an income year in accordance with the following provisions of this section.

             (3)  The asset’s opening adjustable value for the purposes of Division 40 of the new Act is:

                     (a)  for a unit of plant (including IRUs and expenditure on software that is not pooled)—its undeducted cost at the end of 30 June 2001; or

                     (b)  for expenditure on eligible mining or quarrying operations, an item of intellectual property or a spectrum licence—the amount of unrecouped expenditure for the expenditure, item or licence under the former Act at the end of 30 June 2001 reduced, in the case of eligible mining or quarrying operations, by an amount you have deducted or can deduct for the calculation year under the former Act and not yet taken into account in calculating unrecouped expenditure; or

                     (c)  for transport capital expenditure—the entity’s amount of transport capital expenditure under the former Act at the end of 30 June 2001 less any amounts the entity has deducted or can deduct for it under the former Act up to that time; or

                     (d)  for expenditure on a forestry road, a timber mill building, a horticultural plant or a grapevine—the amount of that expenditure less any amounts the entity has deducted or can deduct for it under the former Act up to 30 June 2001; or

                     (e)  for expenditure on evaluating the impact on the environment of a project—the amount of that expenditure less any amounts the entity has deducted or can deduct for it under the former Act up to 30 June 2001; or

                      (f)  for assets that were pooled under Subdivision 42‑M or 42‑L of the former Act—the closing balance of the pool at the end of 30 June 2001.

             (4)  The asset’s base value for applying the formula in section 40‑70 of the new Act for the diminishing value method is that opening adjustable value.

             (5)  The decline in value for the assets referred to in this subsection is worked out using the prime cost method without the adjustments in subsection 40‑75(3) of the new Act, and the opening adjustable value specified in subsection (3) of this section, in this way:

                     (a)  for an item of plant for which you were using the prime cost method—using the rules in section 40‑10 of this Act; and

                     (b)  for an IRU for which you were using the prime cost method—using the rules in section 40‑20 of this Act; and

                     (c)  for a unit of software for which the entity was deducting amounts under Subdivision 46‑B of the former Act—using the rules in subsection 40‑25(2) of this Act; and

                     (d)  for a spectrum licence—using the rules in section 40‑30 of this Act; and

                     (e)  for an item of intellectual property—using the rules in section 40‑45 of this Act; and

                      (f)  for an amount of expenditure on evaluating the impact on the environment of a project—using the rules in section 40‑55 of this Act.

             (6)  The decline in value for the assets referred to in this subsection is worked out using the prime cost method using the adjustments in subsection 40‑75(3) of the new Act, and the opening adjustable value specified in subsection (3) of this section, in this way:

                     (a)  for an amount of unrecouped expenditure under Division 330 of the former Act—using the rules in section 40‑35 of this Act; and

                     (b)  for an amount of transport capital expenditure under Division 330 of the former Act—using the rules in section 40‑40 of this Act; and

                     (c)  for a forestry road or timber mill building—using the rules in section 40‑50 of this Act.

             (7)  The entity must work out the decline in value of each of the assets for later income years under Division 40 of the new Act.

             (8)  The entity must, in working out its deductions under this section for the calculation year for:

                     (a)  allowable capital expenditure for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 330‑C of the former Act; or

                     (b)  transport capital expenditure for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 330‑H of the former Act; or

                     (c)  a water facility for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 387‑B of the former Act; or

                     (d)  expenditure on connecting power to land or upgrading the connection for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 387‑E of the former Act; or

                     (e)  expenditure on a telephone line on or extending to land for which the entity had deducted or can deduct an amount under Subdivision 387‑E of the former Act;

reduce its deductions for each of the periods referred to in paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) by multiplying the deduction for that period by the number of days in that period and dividing the result by 365.

             (9)  The entity cannot deduct anything for an asset referred to in this section under the former Act for any part of its calculation year after 30 June 2001.

           (10)  You are entitled to a further deduction for a depreciating asset for which you are using the diminishing value method if the sum of the deductions worked out under paragraphs (2)(a) and (b) (the **_sum amount_**) is less than the deduction to which you would have been entitled for the asset if the former Act had continued to apply to the whole of the calculation year (the **_former Act amount_**).

           (11)  You increase the amount worked out under paragraph (2)(b) by the difference between the former Act amount and the sum amount.

##### <a id="40‑67"></a>40‑67  Methods for working out decline in value

             (1)  Subsections 40‑65(6) and (7) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply with the changes set out in this section if either or both of the following events have happened:

                     (a)  you have deducted one or more amounts under former section 73BA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for an asset;

                     (b)  you could have deducted one or more amounts under that former section for the asset if you had not chosen tax offsets under former section 73I of that Act.

             (2)  Assume:

                     (a)  paragraph 40‑65(6)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ included both events set out in subsection (1) of this section; and

                     (b)  subsections 40‑65(6) and (7) of that Act deal with all 4 kinds of events in a corresponding way to the way that they deal with 2 kinds of events.

##### <a id="40‑70"></a>40‑70  References to amounts deducted and reductions in deductions

             (1)  A reference in the new Act to an amount that you have deducted or can deduct for a depreciating asset under Division 40 of the new Act includes a reference to an amount that you have deducted or can deduct for a capital allowance relating to the asset under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  An amount you have deducted or can deduct for a water facility under Subdivision 387‑B of the former Act or former section 75B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is taken to have been deducted under Subdivision 40‑F of the new Act.

             (3)  A reference in the new Act to a reduction in your deduction for a depreciating asset includes a reference to amounts by which your deductions for the asset were reduced under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

##### <a id="40‑72"></a>40‑72  New diminishing value method not to apply in some cases

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  you are taken to start holding a depreciating asset on or after 10 May 2006 because of section 40‑115 (about splitting a depreciating asset) or 40‑125 (about merging depreciating assets) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  it is reasonable to conclude that you split the asset or merged the assets for the main purpose of ensuring that the decline in value of the asset or assets (after the splitting or merging) would be worked out under section 40‑72 of that Act;

that Act applies to you as if you had started to hold the split or merged asset or assets before 10 May 2006.

             (2)  The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to you as if you had started to hold a depreciating asset before 10 May 2006 if:

                     (a)  you had actually started to hold it before that day; and

                     (b)  on or after 10 May 2006, you stop holding the depreciating asset; and

                     (c)  it is reasonable to conclude that you did this for the main purpose of ensuring that the decline in value of the asset would be worked out under section 40‑72 of that Act.

             (3)  The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to you as if you had started to hold a depreciating asset (the **_substituted asset_**) before 10 May 2006 if:

                     (a)  you started to hold the substituted asset on or after that day under an arrangement; and

                     (b)  the substituted asset is identical to or has a purpose similar to another depreciating asset that another entity acquired from you on or after that day under that arrangement; and

                     (c)  you did not deal with the other entity at arm’s length; and

                     (d)  it is reasonable to conclude that you entered into the arrangement for the main purpose of ensuring that the decline in value of the substituted asset would be worked out under section 40‑72 of that Act.

##### <a id="40‑75"></a>40‑75  Mining expenditure incurred after 1 July 2001 on an asset

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you hold a depreciating asset (except a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before 1 July 2001) that you:

                              (i)  started to hold under a contract entered into before 1 July 2001; or

                             (ii)  constructed where the construction started before that day; or

                            (iii)  started to hold in some other way before that day; and

                     (b)  your expenditure on the asset, whenever incurred, would have been allowable capital expenditure, transport capital expenditure or expenditure on exploration or prospecting within the meaning of Division 330 of the former Act if it had been incurred before 1 July 2001.

             (2)  If you incur expenditure on the asset after 30 June 2001 that forms part of the cost of the asset, you can deduct the expenditure for the income year in which you incur it if it would have been expenditure on exploration or prospecting within the meaning of Division 330 of the former Act.

             (3)  Otherwise, Subdivision 40‑B of the new Act applies to the asset on the basis that it has a cost, and an adjustable value, of zero at the start of 1 July 2001, and an effective life on that day or at its start time, whichever is the later, worked out under subsection (4) of this section.

             (4)  The effective life of the depreciating asset is the shorter of its effective life worked out under Division 40 and:

                     (a)  if the expenditure on the asset was incurred in relation to eligible mining operations other than in the course of petroleum mining—the shorter of:

                              (i)  10 years; and

                             (ii)  the number of whole years in the estimated life of the mine or proposed mine to which the expenditure relates or, if there is more than one such mine, of the mine that has the longest estimated life; or

                     (b)  if the expenditure on the asset was incurred in relation to eligible mining operations in the course of petroleum mining—the shorter of:

                              (i)  10 years; and

                             (ii)  the number of whole years in the estimated life of the petroleum field or proposed petroleum field to which the expenditure relates; or

                     (c)  if the expenditure on the asset was incurred in relation to eligible quarrying operations—the shorter of:

                              (i)  20 years; or

                             (ii)  the number of whole years in the estimated life of the quarry or proposed quarry to which the expenditure relates or, if there is more than one such quarry, of the quarry that has the longest estimated life.

##### <a id="40‑77"></a>40‑77  Mining, quarrying or prospecting rights or information held before 1 July 2001

             (1)  Division 40 of the new Act does not apply to a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before 1 July 2001.

Note:          If you incur expenditure relating to assets of that kind, you cannot deduct it under Division 40\. However, the expenditure may be taken into account in calculating a capital gain or capital loss under Part 3‑1 or 3‑3 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

          (1A)  Division 40 of the new Act does not apply to a renewal or extension of a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before 1 July 2001.

          (1B)  Subsection (1) applies to a mining, quarrying or prospecting right (the **_new right_**) that you start to hold on or after 1 July 2001 as if you had started to hold the new right before that day if:

                     (a)  you started to hold another mining, quarrying or prospecting right before that day; and

                     (b)  the other right ends on or after that day; and

                     (c)  the new right and the other right relate to the same area, or any difference in area is not significant.

          (1C)  Division 40 of the new Act does not apply to a mining, quarrying or prospecting right if:

                     (a)  a company (the **_original holder_**) started to hold the right before 1 July 2001; and

                     (b)  the right is transferred after that day to another company where:

                              (i)  the other company is a member of the same wholly‑owned group as the original holder and was a member of that group just before that day; and

                             (ii)  the right was held in the period between that day and the time of the transfer by a company or companies that were members of that group on that day and at the time of the transfer.

             (2)  If, after 30 June 2001:

                     (a)  you dispose of a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before 1 July 2001 to an associate of yours (except a company that is a member of the same wholly‑owned group); or

                     (b)  you enter into an arrangement in relation to such a right under which you maintain, in essence, the economic ownership of the right but not its legal ownership;

the cost of the right to the purchaser is limited, for the purposes of Division 40 of the new Act, to a maximum of the costs that would have been deductible for the right under Division 330 of the former Act.

             (3)  An amount that would be included in your assessable income under section 15‑40 or subsection 40‑285(1) of the new Act in respect of mining, quarrying or prospecting information you started to hold before 1 July 2001 is reduced (but not below zero) by so much of the capital cost of acquiring the information that you incurred before that day and that:

                     (a)  you have not deducted and cannot deduct (either immediately or over time) under the former Act; and

                     (b)  did not form part of allowable capital expenditure under the former Act; and

                     (c)  did not entitle you to a deduction under section 330‑235 of the former Act;

but only to the extent that you have not already applied the amount under this section.

             (4)  Your assessable income includes an amount if:

                     (a)  after 1 July 2001, you stop holding a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before that day; and

                     (b)  you have deducted or can deduct an amount for it under Subdivision 330‑C in relation to Subdivision 330‑D or 330‑E of the former Act.

The amount included is the amount you have deducted or can deduct.

             (5)  Your assessable income also includes an amount if:

                     (a)  after 1 July 2001, you stop holding a mining, quarrying or prospecting right that you started to hold before that day; and

                     (b)  because of section 40‑35 or 40‑38 of this Act, you have deducted or can deduct an amount for a notional asset that relates to expenditure on the right under Division 40 of the new Act.

The amount included is the amount you have deducted or can deduct.

             (6)  Division 110 of the new Act applies as if an amount included in assessable income under subsection (4) or (5) of this section were the reversal of a deduction under a provision of the new Act outside Parts 3‑1 and 3‑3 and Division 243.

             (7)  An amount that would be included in your assessable income under subsection 40‑285(1) of the new Act in respect of a mining, quarrying or prospecting right is reduced by an amount worked out under subsection (8) if:

                     (a)  you acquired the right from an associate (except a company that is a member of the same wholly‑owned group) on or after 1 July 2001; and

                     (b)  the associate started to hold the right before that day.

             (8)  The amount is reduced (but not below zero) by the difference between the capital cost that you incurred after that day and the amount to which the cost of the right is limited under subsection (2) of this section.

##### <a id="40‑80"></a>40‑80  Other expenditure incurred after 1 July 2001 on a depreciating asset

             (1)  This section applies to you if:

                     (a)  you incur expenditure after 30 June 2001 that forms part of the cost of a depreciating asset; and

                     (b)  the depreciating asset is one that you:

                              (i)  started to hold under a contract entered into before 1 July 2001; or

                             (ii)  constructed where the construction started before that day; or

                            (iii)  started to hold in some other way before that day; and

                     (c)  if you had incurred the expenditure before 1 July 2001, and had satisfied any relevant requirement for deductibility, you would have been able to deduct an amount for it under Division 44, 373 or 380, or Subdivision 46‑B or 387‑G, of the former Act.

             (2)  Subdivision 40‑B of the new Act applies to the asset on the basis that it has a cost, and an adjustable value, of zero at the start of 1 July 2001.

##### <a id="40‑100"></a>40‑100  Commissioner’s determination of effective life

                   A determination by the Commissioner of the effective life of an asset that was made under section 42‑110 of the former Act and that was in force at the end of 30 June 2001 has effect as if it had been made under section 40‑100 of the new Act.

##### <a id="40‑105"></a>40‑105  Calculations of effective life

             (1)  This section applies to the following (the **_instrument_**):

                     (a)  a determination under section 40‑100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ of the effective life of an asset;

                     (b)  a calculation under section 40‑105 of that Act of the effective life of an asset;

if the instrument was in force immediately before the commencement of Schedule 1 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development)_ _Act 2011_.

             (2)  The instrument has effect, after that commencement, as if it had been made under that section as amended by the _Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development)_ _Act 2011_.

#### Subdivision 40‑C—Cost

40‑230      Car limit

##### <a id="40‑230"></a>40‑230  Car limit

             (1)  Division 40 of the new Act applies as if references in that Division to the car limit included references to:

                     (a)  the car depreciation limit under Division 42 of the former Act; and

                     (b)  the motor vehicle depreciation limit under former section 57AF of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  If you:

                     (a)  have a substituted accounting period; and

                     (b)  start to hold a car in your 2001‑02 income year but before 1 July 2001;

you must use as the car limit the car depreciation limit under section 42‑80 of the former Act for the 2000‑01 financial year.

##### <a id="40‑285"></a>40‑285  Balancing adjustments

             (1)  Paragraphs 40‑285(1)(a) and (2)(a) of the new Act have effect in relation to a depreciating asset that you held at 1 July 2001 as if amounts you have deducted or can deduct for the asset under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ were part of the asset’s decline in value under Division 40.

             (2)  You are entitled to a further deduction under subsection (3) if:

                     (a)  you are entitled to a deduction under subsection 40‑285(2) of the new Act for a balancing adjustment event happening to a depreciating asset:

                              (i)  to which Division 58 of the former Act applied; or

                             (ii)  to which former section 61A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applied, or for which the transition time under Division 57 in Schedule 2D to that Act occurred before 1 July 2001; and

                     (b)  you would have been entitled to a further deduction under section 42‑197 of the former Act.

             (3)  The amount of the further deduction is the amount worked out under section 42‑197 of the former Act.

             (4)  Division 40 of the new Act applies to a balancing adjustment event that occurs on or after 1 July 2001 for a depreciating asset you hold if you held the asset on that day.

             (5)  The amount included in your assessable income under subsection 40‑285(1) or section 40‑370 of the new Act for a balancing adjustment event happening to a depreciating asset is reduced if:

                     (a)  the asset is either:

                              (i)  a depreciating asset that is not plant and that you started to hold under a contract entered into before 1 July 2001, you constructed where the construction started before that day or you started to hold in some other way before that day; or

                             (ii)  plant that you acquired at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; and

                     (b)  any capital gain or capital loss would be disregarded (if Part 3‑1 of the new Act applied):

                              (i)  because of section 118‑5 (about cars, motor cycles and valour decorations); or

                             (ii)  because of section 118‑10 (about collectables); or

                            (iii)  because of section 118‑12 (about plant used to produce exempt income); or

                            (iv)  because the asset was a pre‑CGT asset at the time of the balancing adjustment event.

             (6)  The reduction is:

where:

                    <a name="sum-ruction"></a>**_sum of reductions_** is the sum of the reductions in your deductions for the asset because you did not use it for a particular purpose.

                    <a name="total-declin"></a>**_total decline_** is the decline in value of the depreciating asset since you started to hold it.

             (7)  Section 118‑24 of the new Act applies to CGT event A1 (disposal of a CGT asset) happening to a depreciating asset if the event happens:

                     (a)  if the depreciating asset is plant—at or before 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999; or

                     (b)  if the depreciating asset is not plant—before 1 July 2001;

where:

                     (c)  the time of the event is when you entered into the contract for the disposal of the asset; and

                     (d)  the change in ownership constituting the disposal occurred after the applicable time mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b).

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  on or after 1 July 2001, a company (the **_transferor_**) disposes of a depreciating asset to another company; and

                     (b)  the companies are members of the same linked group at the time of the disposal; and

                     (c)  apart from this section, the disposal would have resulted in:

             (2)  Subsection 40‑35(5), 40‑38(5) or 40‑40(4) of this Act does not apply to the disposal.

             (3)  The amount that is included in the transferor’s assessable income under subsection 40‑285(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is the included amount reduced by the deductible amount.

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  on or after 1 July 2001, a company (the **_transferor_**) disposes of property that is not a depreciating asset to another company; and

                     (b)  the companies are members of the same linked group at the time of the disposal; and

                     (c)  apart from this section, the disposal would have resulted in the transferor having an additional decline in value (the **_deductible amount_**) under subsection 40‑35(5), 40‑37(5), 40‑40(4) or 40‑43(4) of this Act; and

                     (d)  the sum of:

                              (i)  the money the transferor receives, or is entitled to receive, in respect of the disposal; and

                             (ii)  the market value of any other property the transferor receives, or is entitled to receive, in respect of the disposal;

                            is more than the deductible amount.

             (2)  There is no additional decline in value of the notional asset referred to in subsection 40‑35(5), 40‑37(5), 40‑40(4) or 40‑43(4) as a result of the disposal.

             (3)  Any amount that would be included in the transferor’s assessable income under subsection 40‑35(6), 40‑37(6), 40‑38(6), 40‑40(5) or 40‑43(5) of this Act, or subsection 40‑830(6) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, as a result of the disposal is reduced by the deductible amount.

##### <a id="40‑289"></a>40‑289  Surrendered firearms

                   If a balancing adjustment event for a firearm that you hold occurs because you surrender it after the commencement of this section under firearms surrender arrangements, any amount by which its termination value exceeds its adjustable value is not included in your assessable income under subsection 40‑285(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="40‑290"></a>40‑290  Reduction of deductions under former Act etc.

                   Subsection 40‑290(2) of the new Act has effect in relation to a depreciating asset that you held at 1 July 2001 as if:

                     (a)  any amount by which your deductions for the asset were reduced under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ because you did not use it for a particular purpose were an amount by which your deductions for the asset were reduced under section 40‑25 of the new Act; and

                     (b)  the **_total decline_** element of the formula in that subsection included all amounts you have deducted or can deduct for the asset under the former Act or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

R&amp;D entity has old law R&amp;D decline in value deductions

             (1)  This section applies to an R&amp;D entity if:

                     (a)  a balancing adjustment event happens in an income year (the **_event year_**) commencing on or after 1 July 2011 for an asset held by the R&amp;D entity and:

                              (i)  the R&amp;D entity can deduct, for an income year, an amount under section 40‑25 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_new Act_**), as that section applies apart from Division 355 of that Act and former section 73BC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (the **_old Act_**); or

                             (ii)  the R&amp;D entity could have deducted, for an income year, an amount as described in subparagraph (i) if it had used the asset; and

                     (b)  either or both of the following subparagraphs apply:

                             (ii)  the R&amp;D entity chooses tax offsets under former section 73I of the old Act instead of deductions (also the **_old law deductions_**) under those former sections for one or more income years for the asset.

Note:          This section applies even if the R&amp;D entity is entitled under section 355‑100 of the new Act to tax offsets for one or more income years for deductions under section 355‑305 of that Act for the asset.

Section 40‑290 to be applied as if use for carrying on R&amp;D activities were use for a taxable purpose

             (2)  In applying section 40‑290 of the new Act (including references in that section to the reduction of deductions under section 40‑25 of that Act) in relation to the asset, assume that using the asset for a taxable purpose includes using it for:

                     (a)  the purpose of the carrying on, by or on behalf of the R&amp;D entity, of the research and development activities (within the meaning of former section 73B of the old Act) to which the old law deductions relate; or

Increase in amounts deductible or assessable under section 40‑285

             (3)  Any amount (the **_section 40‑285 amount_**):

                     (b)  section 40‑292 of the new Act (as that section applies because of Part 2 of Schedule 4 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development)_ _Act 2011_);

to the extent that they would otherwise apply apart from this section to the R&amp;D entity for the event, do so apply to the R&amp;D entity for the event.

Note 1:       The section 40‑292 of the new Act mentioned in paragraph (a) would otherwise apply for the event in a case where the R&amp;D entity had new law deductions.

Note 2:       The section 40‑292 of the new Act mentioned in paragraph (b) would otherwise apply for the event in respect of the old law deductions.

                     (c)  you can deduct an amount for its decline in value; and

                     (d)  you had not made a choice under section 42‑285 or 42‑293 of the former Act for the balancing adjustment event.

             (3)  The adjustable value of the replacement plant is reduced by the amount covered by the choice as at the first day of the income year in which you acquired it.

Small business taxpayers

             (3)  The transferee also works out the decline in value of the plant under subsection 40‑10(3) or 40‑12(3) of this Act using the same method as the transferor if:

             (4)  For the purposes of item 2 in the table in subsection (3), an entity is treated as if it is not carrying on a business in relation to the activities of a partnership in which the entity is a partner unless the entity is connected with the partnership.

             (5)  A lease of plant referred to in item 3 of the table in subsection (3) is an agreement (including a renewal of an agreement) under which the holder of the plant grants a right to use the plant to another entity, but not a hire purchase agreement or a short‑term hire agreement.

             (6)  The transferee works out the decline in value of the plant by:

                     (a)  for the diminishing value method—replacing the component in the formula in subsection 40‑70(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate the transferor, or the earliest successive transferor, was using; or

                     (b)  for the prime cost method:

                              (i)  replacing the component in the formula in subsection 40‑75(1) of the new Act that includes the plant’s effective life with the rate the transferor, or the earliest successive transferor, was using; and

                             (ii)  increasing the plant’s cost under Division 42 of the former Act by any amounts included in the second element of the plant’s cost after 30 June 2001.

Meaning of small business taxpayer

             (7)  An entity is a **_small business taxpayer_** for an income year if:

                     (a)  the entity carries on a business in that year; and

                     (b)  the entity’s average turnover for that year is less than $1,000,000.

Note:          An entity is treated as carrying on a business if it is winding up a business and it was previously a small business taxpayer: see subsection (11).

                     (d)  that part of the value of the business supplies entities connected with the primary entity made in the income year that is attributable to supplies the connected entities made during the year to the primary entity when they were connected with it; and

                     (e)  that part of the value of the business supplies another entity made in the income year that is attributable to supplies the other entity made to a third entity at a time when both the other entity and third entity were connected with the primary entity.

Value of business supplies

           (10)  The **_value_** of the business supplies an entity makes in an income year is the sum of:

                     (a)  for taxable supplies (if any) the entity makes during the year in the course of carrying on a business—the value (as defined by section 9‑75 of the GST Act) of the supplies; and

##### <a id="70‑10"></a>70‑10  Accounting for your disposal of items that stop being trading stock because of the change of definition

             (1)  This section explains how to account for your disposal of an item during or after the 1997‑98 income year if:

                     (a)  just _before_ that income year, the item was an item of your trading stock, as defined in subsection 6(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ as in force at that time; and

                     (b)  at no time since that time has the item been an item of your trading stock, as defined in section 70‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Example:    This section applies to an item you produced, manufactured, acquired or purchased _before_ 1997‑98 for manufacture, sale or exchange, but have not held for that purpose at any time since just before the start of that year.

If the disposal is outside the ordinary course of business

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the disposal occurred _on or after_ 1 July 1997; and

                     (b)  former subsection 36(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (dealing with disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business) would have applied to the disposal if it had occurred _before_ 1 July 1997;

sections 70‑90 and 70‑95 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (dealing with disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business) apply to your disposal of the item as if it were an item of your trading stock (as defined in section 70‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

Note:          This ensures that your assessable income includes the market value of the item on the day of disposal. This counters your deduction under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for your expenditure to acquire the item as trading stock.

Additional rule for early balancers

             (3)  If the disposal occurred _before_ 1 July 1997, then, for the purposes of former subsection 36(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (dealing with disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business), the item is taken to have been, at the time of the disposal, trading stock as defined in section 70‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          See the note to subsection (2).

Deduction for closing value at end of 1996‑97

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  former subsection 36(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to the disposal, or would have if it had occurred before 1 July 1997; and

                     (b)  the item’s value was taken into account at the end of the 1996‑97 income year under former Subdivision B (Trading stock) of Division 2 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_;

you can deduct for the income year of the disposal the item’s value as so taken into account.

Note:          This deduction offsets the effect of the item’s value _not_ having been taken into account under Subdivision 70‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ at the start of the income year of the disposal.

##### <a id="70‑20"></a>70‑20  Application of section 70‑20 of the _Income Tax Assessment_ Act 1997 to trading stock bought on or after 1 July 1997

                   Section 70‑20 (Non‑arm’s length transactions) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to purchases that take place on or after 1 July 1997.

##### <a id="70‑55"></a>70‑55  Cost of live stock acquired by natural increase

             (1)  Section 70‑55 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to animals acquired by natural increase in or after the 1997‑98 income year.

             (2)  For the purposes of Subdivision 70‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the **_cost_** of an animal acquired by natural increase before the 1997‑98 income year is the cost price of the animal under former section 34 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (3)  For the purposes of Subdivision 70‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the **_cost_** of an animal acquired by a partnership by natural increase before the 1997‑98 income year depends on whether its cost price has been used in working out the share of a partner in the partnership’s net income or partnership loss for an earlier income year:

                     (a)  if it has, the **_cost_** is that cost price, or the _lowest_ of those cost prices if more than one cost price was used to work out the respective shares of partners;

                     (b)  if it has not, the **_cost_** is the minimum cost price prescribed for the purposes of former section 34 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for that class of animal for the time when the animal was acquired, or the animal’s actual cost price if no minimum was prescribed.

Note 1:       Former section 93 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ allowed each partner to choose the cost price of an animal for working out the partner’s share of the partnership’s net income or partnership loss for income years before the 1997‑98 income year.

Note 2:       Former section 34 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ provides for the valuation of live stock acquired by natural increase before the 1997‑98 income year.

##### <a id="70‑70"></a>70‑70  Valuing interests in FIFs on hand at the start of 1991‑92

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an interest in a FIF was an item of your trading stock on hand at the _start_ of the 1991‑92 income year; and

                     (b)  that interest was also an item of your trading stock on hand at the _end_ of the 1997‑98 income year or a later income year;

the **_value_** of the item at the _end_ of the 1997‑98 or later income year is the value of the item as taken into account under former Subdivision B (Trading stock) of Division 2 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ at the _start_ of the 1991‑92 income year.

             (2)  This section has effect despite section 70‑45 (the general rule about how to value your trading stock at the end of the income year) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, but subject to subsection 70‑70(2) (which allows you to elect to value all your interests in FIFs at their market value instead) of that Act.

Effect of election under former subsection 31(5) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 on valuation of interests in FIFs

             (3)  If you made an election under former subsection 31(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (to value all your interests in FIFs at market value), subsection 70‑70(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to your interests in FIFs as if you had made an election under subsection 70‑70(2).

##### <a id="70‑90"></a>70‑90  Application of sections 70‑90 and 70‑95 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to disposals of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business

                   Sections 70‑90 (Assessable income on disposal of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business) and 70‑95 (Purchase price is taken to be market value) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply to a disposal of an item of trading stock that takes place on or after 1 July 1997.

##### <a id="70‑100"></a>70‑100  Application of section 70‑100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to disposals of trading stock outside ordinary course of business

Basic application

             (1)  Section 70‑100 (Notional disposal when you stop holding an item as trading stock) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to trading stock that stops being trading stock on hand of an entity on or after 1 July 1997.

Transitional provision if that section affects an assessment for 1996‑97

             (2)  The value of trading stock to which subsection (4) of that section applies is to be worked out using the rules in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (and not the rules in Subdivision 70‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) if:

                     (a)  that section affects an assessment for the 1996‑97 year of income under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  an election is made under subsection (4) of that section to value trading stock at what would have been its value at the end of an income year ending on the day it became trading stock on hand of the second entity.

Note:          Section 70‑100 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ may affect an assessment for the 1996‑97 income year if any of the entities with an interest in the trading stock (either before or after it becomes trading stock on hand of the second entity) has a 1996‑97 income year ending on or after 1 July 1997.

##### <a id="70‑105"></a>70‑105  Application of section 70‑105 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to deaths on or after 1 July 1997

             (1)  Section 70‑105 (Death of owner) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to trading stock that devolves as a result of a person dying on or after 1 July 1997.

Transitional provision if that section affects an assessment for 1996‑97

             (2)  The value of an item to which subsection (3) or (4) of that section applies is to be worked out using the rules in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (and not the rules in Subdivision 70‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) if:

                     (a)  that section affects an assessment for the 1996‑97 year of income under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  an election is made under subsection (3) or (4) of that section to value the item at an amount other than its market value.

Note:          Section 70‑105 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ may affect an assessment for the 1996‑97 income year if an entity on which the item devolves has a 1996‑97 income year ending on or after 1 July 1997.

##### <a id="70‑115"></a>70‑115  Application of section 70‑115 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to insurance and indemnity payments in 1997‑98 and later income years

                   Section 70‑115 (Compensation for lost trading stock) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to an amount received in the 1997‑98 income year or a later income year by way of insurance or indemnity for a loss of trading stock, even if the loss occurred earlier. However, that section does not apply to an amount that is assessable income for an income year before the 1997‑98 income year.

##### <a id="82‑10"></a>82‑10  Pre‑10 May 2006 entitlements—_transitional termination payments_

             (1)  This Division  applies in relation to a life benefit termination payment received by you on or after 1 July 2007 if:

                     (a)  the payment is received by you because you are entitled to it under a written contract, a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or another country, an instrument under such a law, a collective agreement within the meaning of the _Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009_ or an AWA within the meaning of that Act; and

                     (b)  the entitlement is provided for under that contract, law, instrument or agreement as in force just before 10 May 2006.

             (2)  However, this Division  does not apply in relation to a life benefit termination payment received by you on or after 1 July 2012 (except to the extent provided by Subdivision 82‑E).

             (3)  This Division  applies in relation to a life benefit termination payment only to the extent that the contract, law or agreement as in force just before 10 May 2006 specifies the amount of the payment, or a way to work out a specific amount of the payment.

             (4)  For the purpose of subsection (3), a specific amount can be worked out in ways including either or both of the following:

                     (a)  by a method or formula for working out the amount;

                     (b)  by provision for you or another person (or entity) to make a choice between forms of payment allowing amounts to be worked out as provided by subsection (3) and paragraph (a) of this subsection.

Example:    For paragraph (b), a specific amount of a life benefit termination payment that you receive on 1 July 2007 can be worked out from the terms of your written contract if the contract provided (just before 10 May 2006) for you to choose between payment in the form of a cash amount of $100,000 or the transfer to you of 10,000 shares in a specified company.

Note:          Section 80‑15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ allows for employment termination payments to include the transfer of property (for example, shares). If so, the market value of the property is included in the amount of the payment (except any part of the property for which separate consideration has been given).

             (5)  To the extent that this Division applies to a life benefit termination payment, Subdivision 82‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not apply to the payment (subject to  Subdivision 82‑E of this Act).

             (6)  In this Division:

                    <a name="transition-termin-payment"></a>**_transitional termination payment_** means:

                     (a)  a life benefit termination payment to which this Division applies; or

                     (b)  if this Division applies to only part of a life benefit termination payment—that part of the payment.

#### Subdivision 82‑B—Transitional termination payments: general

**Table of sections**

82‑10A     Recipient has reached preservation age

82‑10B      Lower cap amount

82‑10C      Recipient under preservation age

82‑10D     Upper cap amount

##### <a id="82‑10A"></a>82‑10A  Recipient has reached preservation age

Application

             (1)  This section applies to a transitional termination payment you receive (except any part of the payment that is a directed termination payment) if you are your preservation age or older on the last day of the income year in which you receive the payment.

Note 1:       You do not pay income tax on directed termination payments: see section 82‑10G.

Note 2:       Under section 82‑10C, you may also be entitled to a tax offset on the taxable component of a transitional termination payment you receive in an income year before the year in which you reached your preservation age.

Tax free component

             (2)  The tax free component of the payment is not assessable income and is not exempt income.

Taxable component

             (3)  The taxable component of the payment is assessable income.

             (4)  You are entitled to a tax offset that ensures that the rate of income tax on the amount mentioned in subsection (6) (the **_low rate part_**) does not exceed 15%.

             (5)  You are entitled to a tax offset that ensures that the rate of income tax on the amount mentioned in subsection (7) (the **_middle rate part_**) does not exceed 30%.

Note:          The remaining part is taxed at the top marginal rate in accordance with the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_.

             (6)  The low rate part  is so much of the taxable component of the payment as does not exceed your lower cap amount under section 82‑10B.

             (7)  The middle rate part  is so much of the taxable component of the payment as:

Note:          If you have received another life benefit termination payment in the same income year (or in an earlier income year) that is not a transitional termination payment, your entitlement to a tax offset under this section is not affected by your entitlement (if any) to a tax concession for the other payment (under section 82‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

##### <a id="82‑10B"></a>82‑10B  Lower cap amount

Initial lower cap amount is the ETP cap for the income year

             (1)  Your **_lower cap amount_** in relation to a transitional termination payment you receive at a time in an income year is the ETP cap amount for the year, reduced in accordance with this section.

Note:          For the ETP cap amount, see section 82‑160 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Reduction of lower cap amount in relation to each payment

             (2)  Reduce your lower cap amount in relation to the payment (but not below zero):

                     (a)  by the amount (if any) (the **_cap excess_**) worked out under subsection (3); and

                     (b)  by so much of the total amounts of transitional termination payments (if any) that you received at an earlier time (whether in the income year or in an earlier income year) for which you are entitled to a tax offset under subsection 82‑10A(4).

             (3)  For paragraph (2)(a), the cap excess is worked out using this method:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Work out the total of the taxable components of all the amounts (if any) of transitional termination payments received by you (including any directed termination payments received on your behalf) in any income year before the income year in which you reached your preservation age.

Step 2.   Work out the total of the taxable components of all the directed termination payments (if any) received on your behalf at an earlier time, in the income year in which you reached your preservation age or later.

Step 3.   Work out the amount (the **_cap difference_**) by which $1,000,000 exceeds the ETP cap for the income year in which you receive the payment to which subsection (1) applies.

Step 4.   The cap excess is the amount (not less than zero) by which the sum of the amounts in steps 1 and 2 exceeds the cap difference in step 3.

Directed termination payments—time of receipt when received by entity to which they are directed

             (4)  For the purposes of this section, a directed termination payment is taken to be received on your behalf at the time the entity to which it is directed receives the payment.

ETP cap not to be reduced under section 82‑10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

             (5)  For the purposes of this section, disregard any reduction of the ETP cap amount under section 82‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Application

             (1)  This section applies to a transitional termination payment you receive (except any part of the payment that is a directed termination payment) if you are under your preservation age on the last day of the income year in which you receive the payment.

Note:          You do not pay income tax on directed termination payments: see section 82‑10G.

Tax free component

             (2)  The tax free component of the payment is not assessable income and is not exempt income.

Taxable component

Note:          The remainder of the taxable component is taxed at the top marginal rate in accordance with the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_.

             (5)  The amount  is so much of the taxable component of the payment as does not exceed your upper cap amount under section 82‑10D.

Note:          If you have received another life benefit termination payment in the same income year (or in an earlier income year) that is not a transitional termination payment, your entitlement to a tax offset under this section is not affected by your entitlement (if any) to a tax concession for the other payment (under section 82‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_).

                     (a)  by the total of all the amounts (if any) included in your assessable income under subsection 82‑10C(3) and subsection 82‑10A(3) that you received at an earlier time (whether in the income year or in an earlier income year); and

                     (b)  by the total amount of the taxable components of all directed termination payments (if any) received on your behalf at an earlier time (whether in the income year or in an earlier income year).

             (1)  Division 83A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies in relation to an ESS interest if:

                     (a)  the interest was acquired on or after 1 July 2009; and

                     (b)  the relevant share or right (within the meaning of Division 13A of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as in force at the time (the **_pre‑Division 83A time_**) occurring just before Schedule 1 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Budget Measures No. 2) Act 2009_ commenced, (**_former Division 13A_**)) was _not_ acquired (within the meaning of former Division 13A) before 1 July 2009.

             (2)  Furthermore, Subdivision 83A‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and the rest of Division 83A of that Act, to the extent that it relates to that Subdivision) also applies in relation to an ESS interest if:

                     (a)  all of the following subparagraphs apply:

                              (i)  for the purposes of Division 115 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (Discount capital gains and trusts’ net capital gains), treat the ESS interest as having been acquired by an individual when the individual acquired the legal title in the share or right of which the ESS interest forms part; and

                             (ii)  for the purposes of Division 392 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (Statements), disregard any election made under former section 139E of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                     (b)  if there is a beneficial interest in the share or right that is an ESS interest—Division 83A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not apply in relation to the interest under section 83A‑5.

             (2)  If subparagraph (1)(a)(i) applies, to avoid doubt, former Division 13A continues to apply (in spite of its repeal) to the share or right.

             (3)  If subparagraph (1)(a)(ii) applies, to avoid doubt, sections 26AAC and 26AAD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as in force at the pre‑Division 83A time, continue to apply (in spite of their repeal) to the share or right.

##### <a id="83A‑15"></a>83A‑15  Indeterminate rights

             (1)  This section applies if:

##### <a id="102‑5"></a>102‑5  Working out capital gains and capital losses

General rule

             (1)  In working out whether you have made a capital gain or a capital loss from a CGT event that happens in relation to a CGT asset in the 1998‑99 income year or a later income year, you use only the provisions of Parts 3‑1 and 3‑3 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(or a provision of an Act that modifies the operation of those Parts) unless a provision of this Part or Part 3‑3 of this Act also requires you to use another provision.

Note 1:       This means that, for example, in working out your cost base of the asset, you will apply the new law to circumstances that occurred before the 1998‑99 income year (except where this Act requires you to use another provision).

Note 2:       In most cases, the other provision is a provision of this Act. However, in some cases, other provisions may be relevant (for example, provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_).

Note 3:       Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ includes provisions that modify the operation of Parts 3‑1 and 3‑3 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Roll‑overs

                     (b)  the entity owned the asset just before the start of that income year; and

                     (c)  a CGT event happens in relation to the asset in that income year or a later one;

the provisions of Parts 3‑1 and 3‑3 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply to the asset from the time when the roll‑over happened except that the first element of the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset (when the roll‑over happened) is the amount the entity is taken to have paid as consideration in respect of the acquisition of the asset under the relevant provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936._

##### <a id="102‑15"></a>102‑15  Applying net capital losses

             (1)  In working out whether you have a net capital gain for the 1998‑99 income year, the amount of any net capital loss for the 1997‑98 income year or an earlier income year must be worked out under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.

             (2)  If you had a net capital loss for the 1997‑98 income year, or some unapplied net capital loss for either of the 2 preceding income years, under former Part IIIA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, it can be carried forward to a later income year to be applied under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          The way in which capital losses can be applied may be affected by other provisions: see section 102‑30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

             (3)  If you had a net listed personal‑use asset loss for the 1997‑98 income year under former Part IIIA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936,_ it is taken for the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be a net capital loss from collectables for that income year.

             (1)  There may be a roll‑over if:

                     (a)  a CGT event happens because all or part of the life insurance business of a life insurance company (the **_originating company_**) is transferred to another life insurance company (the **_recipient company_**):

                              (i)  in accordance with a scheme confirmed by the Federal Court of Australia under Part 9 of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_; or

                             (ii)  under the _Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Act 1999_; and

                     (b)  the originating company and the recipient company were members of the same wholly‑owned group just before the transfer; and

                     (c)  one of these happens:

                              (i)  a CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) of the originating company becomes an asset of the recipient company; or

                             (ii)  a CGT asset of the originating company ends and the recipient company acquires an equivalent replacement asset; or

                            (iii)  the originating company creates a CGT asset in the recipient company; and

                     (d)  the transfer takes place:

                              (i)  before 30 June 2004; or

                             (ii)  if the originating company and the recipient company are members of the same consolidated group or consolidatable group and the head company of that group has a substituted accounting period—before the end of the head company’s income year in which 30 June 2004 occurs.

             (2)  The CGT asset involved (the **_roll‑over asset_**) must not be trading stock of the recipient company just after the time of the transfer.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the roll‑over asset is a right or convertible interest referred to in Division 130, or an option referred to in Division 134, of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ or an exchangeable interest; and

                     (b)  the recipient company acquires another CGT asset by exercising the right or option or by converting the convertible interest or in exchange for the disposal or redemption of the exchangeable interest;

the other asset cannot become trading stock of the recipient company just after the recipient company acquired it.

##### <a id="126‑160"></a>126‑160  Effects of roll‑over

             (1)  A capital gain or capital loss the originating company makes from the CGT event is disregarded.

             (2)  The first element of the cost base of the original asset or the replacement asset for the recipient company is the cost base of the original asset for the originating company just before the time of the CGT event.

             (3)  The first element of the reduced cost base of the original asset or the replacement asset for the recipient company is worked out similarly.

             (4)  For a case where the originating company creates a CGT asset in the recipient company, the first  element of the asset’s cost base (in the hands of the recipient company) is the amount applicable under this table. The first element of its reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

                     (b)  on or before the day specified in subsection (2) or (3), the company issues other shares, or the trustee issues other units, (the **_bonus equities_**) to you because it owes an amount to you in relation to the original equities.

             (2)  If the bonus equities are shares and they were issued on or before 30 June 1987:

                     (a)  subsection 130‑20(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not apply to you; and

                     (b)  you work out the cost base and reduced cost base of the bonus equities under subsection 130‑20(3) of that Act regardless of whether any part of the amount owed to you by the company is a dividend.

             (3)  The rule in item 2 of the table in subsection 130‑20(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not apply if the bonus equities were issued on or before 1 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 10 December 1986 and you were required to pay or give something for them.

                     (a)  that time is before that day; and

                     (b)  subsection 165‑115U(1D) of that Act would otherwise require the choice to be made before the end of those 6 months.

##### <a id="165‑115ZC"></a>165‑115ZC  When certain notices to be given

             (1)  A notice under subsection 165‑115ZC(4) or (5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ must be given within 6 months after the day on which the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent if the alteration time is before that day.

             (2)  If, because of amendments made by Schedule 14 to the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_, a notice already given under subsection 165‑115ZC(4) or (5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ before the day referred to in subsection (1) of this section no longer complies with section 165‑115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the entity required to give the notice may comply with that section 165‑115ZC by giving a further notice.

             (3)  The further notice:

                     (a)  must vary the notice referred to in subsection (2) in such a way (which may include setting out additional information) that the notice as varied complies with section 165‑115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as affected by the amendments; and

                     (b)  must be given within the 6 months referred to in subsection (1) of this section, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner; and

                     (c)  must otherwise be given in accordance with that section.

Special rules for consolidatable groups and potential MEC groups

             (4)  Subsections (5) and (6) have effect if:

                     (a)  the alteration time mentioned in section 165‑115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is after 10 November 1999 and before 1 July 2004; and

                     (b)  apart from this section, subsection 165‑115ZC(4) or (5) of that Act would require an entity (the **_notifying entity_**) to give a notice to another entity (the **_receiving entity_**) in relation to the alteration time; and

                     (c)  just before the alteration time, the notifying entity and the receiving entity were both members of the same consolidatable group or potential MEC group.

             (5)  Subsections 165‑115ZC(4) and (5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ do not apply to the notifying entity if both it and the receiving entity became members of the same consolidated group or MEC group before 1 July 2004.

             (6)  Even if subsection (5) does not apply, the notifying entity is not required to give the notice to the receiving entity before the end of 6 months after the commencement of this subsection.

             (7)  Subsections (1) and (3) have effect subject to subsections (5) and (6).

##### <a id="165‑115ZD"></a>165‑115ZD  Adjustment (or further adjustment) for interest realised at a loss after global method has been used

             (1)  This section affects how sections 165‑115ZA and 165‑115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply to an interest (the **_equity_**) in, or a debt owed by, a company if apart from this section, a loss (the **_realised loss_**):

                     (a)  would be realised for income tax purposes by a realisation event that happens to the equity or debt; or

                     (b)  would be so realised but for Subdivision 170‑D of that Act (which defers realisation of capital losses and deductions);

and the company chose to use the global method of working out whether it had an adjusted unrealised loss at the last alteration time:

                     (c)  that happened for the company, before the realisation event; and

                     (d)  immediately before which the equity or debt was, or was part of:

                              (i)  if the company was a loss company at that alteration time—a relevant equity interest, or a relevant debt interest, that an entity had in the company; or

                             (ii)  otherwise—what would have been such an interest if the company had been a loss company at that alteration time;

and these conditions are satisfied:

                     (e)  that last alteration time is before the day on which the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent; and

                      (f)  the entity that owns the equity or debt immediately before the realisation event chooses to apply this section to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, instead of section 165‑115ZD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (g)  the choice is made on or before the latest of these:

                              (i)  the last day of the period of 6 months after the day referred to in paragraph (c) of this subsection;

                             (ii)  the day on which the entity lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the realisation event occurred;

                            (iii)  such later day as the Commissioner allows.

If the entity makes that choice, this section applies accordingly instead of that section.

             (2)  In addition to any application to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, that sections 165‑115ZA and 165‑115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ have apart from this section, those sections apply (and are taken always to have applied) to the equity or debt, in relation to that last alteration time, as if:

                     (a)  the company had an adjusted unrealised loss at that time equal to the realised loss (see subsection (1) or (5), as appropriate, of this section) of this section, except so much of the loss as it is reasonable to conclude is attributable to _none_ of these:

                              (i)  a notional capital loss, or a notional revenue loss, that the company has at that last alteration time in respect of a CGT asset;

                             (ii)  a trading stock decrease in relation to that time for a CGT asset that was trading stock of the company at that time; and

                     (b)  the company were therefore a loss company at that time; and

                     (c)  that adjusted unrealised loss were the company’s overall loss at that time.

             (3)  For the purposes of how sections 165‑115ZA and 165‑115ZB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply because of this section, the adjustment amount under section 165‑115ZB of that Act is to be worked out and applied in accordance with subsection 165‑115ZB(6) (the non‑formula method) of that Act.

             (4)  To avoid doubt:

                     (a)  a notice need not be given under section 165‑115ZC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because of this section; and

                     (b)  this section does not affect the requirements that apply to a notice that otherwise must be given under that section.

             (5)  If the equity or debt is a revenue asset at the time of the realisation event, subsection (2) applies on the basis that the realised loss is the total of:

                     (a)  the loss (if any) realised for income tax purposes by the realisation event happening to the equity or debt in its character as a CGT asset; and

                     (b)  the loss (if any) realised for income tax purposes by the realisation event happening to the equity or debt in its character as a revenue asset.

Working out the amount of section 197‑60 untainting tax

             (2)  For the purpose of section 197‑60 of new Division 197, the **_tainting amount_** at the time of the choice to untaint is taken to consist of:

                     (a)  the amounts (the **_old Division 7B tainting amount components_**) that made up the old Division 7B tainting amount; and

                     (b)  any amounts to which new Division 197 applies that have been transferred to the company’s share capital account since the introduction day and before the choice to untaint is made.

Note 1:       The company will not be liable to untainting tax if it is covered by subsection (5).

             (3)  For the purpose of section 197‑60 of new Division 197, a reference to the section 197‑45 franking debit that arose in relation to an old Division 7B tainting amount component is taken to be a reference to the tax‑paid‑basis franking debit amount in relation to that component (see subsection (4)).

             (4)  For the purpose of subsection (3), the **_tax‑paid‑basis franking debit amount_**, in relation to an old Division 7B tainting amount component, is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

where:

                    <a name="class-frank-debit"></a>**_class A franking debit_** means the class A franking debit (if any) that arose under section 160ARDV of old Division 7B in relation to the old Division 7B tainting amount component.

                    <a name="class-frank-debit"></a>**_class C franking debit_** means the class C franking debit that arose under section 160ARDQ or 160ARDV of old Division 7B in relation to the old Division 7B tainting amount component.

             (5)  The company is not liable to untainting tax under section 197‑60 of new Division 197 in relation to the choice to untaint if:

                     (a)  during the period from the time when the company’s share capital account became tainted under old Division 7B to the time when the choice to untaint is made, the company was a company with only lower tax shareholders (as defined in subsection 197‑60(1) of new Division 197); and

                     (b)  the tainting amount for the purpose of section 197‑60 of new Division 197 does not include any amounts of the kind mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) of this section.

             (6)  If:

                     (a)  the tainting amount for the purpose of section 197‑60 of new Division 197 consists of or includes an amount or amounts of the kind mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) of this section; and

                     (b)  during the period from the time when the company’s share capital account became tainted to the time when the amount, or the first of the amounts, referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection was transferred into the company’s share capital account, the company was a company with only lower tax shareholders (as defined in subsection 197‑60(1) of new Division 197);

then, despite subsection (2) of this section, for the purpose of section 197‑60 of new Division 197, the tainting amount at the time of the choice to untaint does not include the old Division 7B tainting amount components.

Working out the amount of section 197‑65 franking debit

             (7)  For the purpose of section 197‑65 of new Division 197, the **_tainting amount_** at the time of the choice to untaint is taken to consist of:

                     (a)  the amounts (the **_old Division 7B tainting amount components_**) that made up the old Division 7B tainting amount; and

                     (b)  any amounts to which new Division 197 applies that have been transferred to the company’s share capital account since the introduction day and before the choice to untaint is made.

Note:          In relation to amounts described in paragraph (b), section 197‑65 applies without any notional modifications.

             (8)  Paragraph 197‑65(1)(b) of new Division 197 has effect in relation to each old Division 7B tainting amount component as if the following paragraph (the **_notionally substituted paragraph_**) were substituted for it:

                     (b)  the tax‑paid‑basis franking debit amount in relation to the old Division 7B tainting amount component is less than the amount calculated by the formula in subsection 197‑65(3) in relation to the component.

             (9)  Subsection 197‑65(3) of new Division 197 has effect in relation to each old Division 7B tainting amount component as if the reference to the amount of the franking debit that arose under section 197‑45 in relation to the transferred amount were instead a reference to the tax‑paid‑basis franking debit amount in relation to the old Division 7B tainting amount component.

           (10)  For the purpose of the notionally substituted paragraph, and of subsection (9) of this section, the **_tax‑paid‑basis franking debit amount_**, in relation to an old Division 7B tainting amount component, is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula:

##### <a id="205‑20"></a>205‑20  A late balancing company may elect to have its FDT liability determined on 30 June

             (1)  This section applies after 30 June 2002.

             (2)  A corporate tax entity’s liability to pay franking deficit tax is determined under sections 205‑25 and 205‑30 of this Act (the **_transitional provisions_**), and not under sections 205‑45 and 205‑50 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(the **_ongoing provisions_**), if:

Object

             (1)  While recognising that an entity may anticipate franking credits when franking distributions, the object of this section is to prevent those credits from being anticipated indefinitely by requiring the entity to reconcile its franking account at certain times and levying tax if the account is in deficit.

Franking deficit at end of 30 June

             (2)  An entity is liable to pay franking deficit tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Act 2002_ if its franking account is in deficit at the end of 30 June in the year 2003 or a later year _._

Corporate tax entity ceases to be a franking entity

             (3)  An entity is liable to pay franking deficit tax imposed by the _New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Act 2002_ if:

                     (a)  it ceases to be a franking entity after 30 June 2002; and

                     (b)  immediately before it ceases to be a franking entity, its franking account is in deficit.

Note:          The tax is imposed in the _New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Act 2002_ and the amount of the tax is set out in that Act.

##### <a id="205‑30"></a>205‑30  Deferring franking deficit

Object

             (1)  The object of this section is to ensure that an entity does not avoid franking deficit tax by deferring the time at which a franking debit occurs in its franking account.

End of year deficit deferred

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  a corporate tax entity receives a refund of income tax within 3 months after 30 June in the year 2003 or a later year; and

                     (b)  the refund is attributable to a period of 12 months ending at the end of 30 June in that year; and

                     (c)  the franking account of the entity would have been in deficit, or in deficit to a greater extent, at the end of 30 June in that year if the refund had been received immediately before that time;

the refund is taken to have been paid to the entity immediately before that time.

Deficit on ceasing to be a franking entity deferred

             (3)  If an entity ceases to be a franking entity during a period of 12 months ending on 30 June in the year 2003 or a later year, a refund of income tax is taken to have been paid to it immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity, for the purposes of subsection 205‑25(3), if:

                     (a)  the refund is attributable to a period within that 12 months during which the entity was a franking entity; and

                     (b)  the refund is paid within 3 months after the entity ceases to be a franking entity; and

                     (c)  the franking account of the entity would have been in deficit, or in deficit to a greater extent, immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity, if the refund had been received before it ceased to be a franking entity.

                     (a)  an income year of a corporate tax entity ends after 30 June 2004; and

                     (b)  the entity makes a valid election under section 205‑20 in that income year;

section 205‑70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect in relation to the entity’s assessment for that income year as if the following method statement had replaced the method statement in that section.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1\. Work out the total amount of franking deficit tax that is covered by paragraph (1)(a) and was incurred on or before the 30 June in the relevant year.

              Then reduce it by 30% if it exceeds 10% of the total amount of franking credits that arose in the entity’s franking account during the period of 12 months immediately preceding that 30 June.

Step 2\. Work out the total amount of franking deficit tax that is covered by paragraph (1)(a) and was incurred after the 30 June in the relevant year.

              Then reduce it by 30% if it exceeds 10% of the total amount of franking credits that arose in the entity’s franking account after that date and before the end of the last day on which the entity incurred a franking deficit tax liability in the relevant year.

Step 3\. Work out the total amount of franking deficit tax that is covered by paragraph (1)(b) in relation to a previous income year and was incurred on or before the 30 June in that income year.

              Then reduce it by 30% if it exceeds 10% of the total amount of franking credits that arose in the entity’s franking account during the period of 12 months immediately preceding that 30 June.

Step 4\. Work out the total amount of franking deficit tax that is covered by paragraph (1)(b) in relation to a previous income year and was incurred after the 30 June in that income year.

              Then reduce it by 30% if it exceeds 10% of the total amount of franking credits that arose in the entity’s franking account after that date and before the end of the last day on which the entity incurred a franking deficit tax liability in that income year.

Step 5\. Add up the results of steps 3 and 4 for all the previous income years covered by paragraph (1)(b).

Step 6\. Work out the excess that is covered by paragraph (1)(c).

Step 7\. Add up the results of steps 1, 2, 5 and 6\. The result is the tax offset to which the entity is entitled under this section for the relevant year.

Application of the 30% reduction rule

             (5)  If a franking credit has been taken into account previously in reducing an amount worked out under a step in the method statement in:

                     (a)  subsection (3) or (4); or

                     (b)  section 205‑70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_;

that credit is not to be taken into account again in reducing another amount worked out under a step in such a method statement.

             (6)  The 30% reductions for an entity in steps 2 and 3 of the method statement in subsection (3), and in steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the method statement in subsection (4), apply only to franking deficit tax that is attributable to franking debits of the entity:

                     (a)  that arose under table item 1, 3, 5 or 6 in section 205‑30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the relevant income year; and

                     (b)  if the entity has franking debits covered by paragraph (a) for the relevant income year—that arose under table item 2 in that section of that Act for the relevant income year.

             (7)  The 30% reductions in those steps do not apply in working out the amount of the tax offset to which an entity is entitled for the relevant year if the Commissioner determines in writing, on application by the entity in the approved form, that the excess referred to in those steps was due to events outside the control of the entity.

             (8)  A determination under subsection (7) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="205‑71"></a>205‑71  Modification of franking deficit tax offset rules

             (1)  This section applies to events that occur on or after 1 July 2002 and before the start of the 2004‑05 income year.

             (2)  The 30% reductions for an entity in steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in subsection 205‑70(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply only to franking deficit tax that is attributable to franking debits of the entity:

                     (a)  that arose under table item 1, 3, 5 or 6 in section 205‑30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the relevant income year; and

                     (b)  if the entity has franking debits covered by paragraph (a) for the relevant income year—that arose under table item 2 in that section of that Act for the relevant income year.

             (3)  The 30% reductions in steps 1 and 2 of the method statement in subsection 205‑70(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ do not apply in working out the amount of the tax offset to which an entity is entitled for the relevant year if the Commissioner determines in writing, on application by the entity in the approved form, that the excess referred to in those steps was due to events outside the control of the entity.

             (4)  A determination under subsection (3) is not a legislative instrument.

##### <a id="205‑75"></a>205‑75  Working out the tax offset for the first income year

First income year and relevant liabilities

             (1)  This section applies to a corporate tax entity in relation to:

                     (a)  this income year of the entity (the **_first income year_**):

                              (i)  the 2001‑2002 income year if subsection 205‑70(2) applies to the entity; or

                             (ii)  the 2002‑2003 income year if subsection 205‑70(2) does not apply to the entity; and

                     (b)  amounts of liabilities incurred by the entity (the **_relevant liabilities_**) that:

                              (i)  are covered by paragraph (1)(a) of former section 160AQK or of former section 160AQKAA (as appropriate) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_; and

                             (ii)  have not been applied under that Act to reduce the entity’s income tax liabilities for an earlier income year.

Relevant liabilities carried forward to the first income year

             (2)  Section 205‑70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect in relation to the entity as if:

                     (a)  so much of the relevant liabilities as were incurred by the entity during the first income year were liabilities to pay franking deficit tax under that Act; and

                     (b)  so much of the relevant liabilities as were incurred by the entity before the start of the first income year were the excess mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) of that section.

             (3)  Subsection (2) has effect only for the purposes of working out:

                     (a)  whether or not the entity is entitled to a tax offset under section 205‑70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the first income year or a later income year; and

                     (b)  the amount of that tax offset.

##### <a id="205‑80"></a>205‑80  Application of Subdivision C of Division 5 of former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_

             (1)  This section applies if Subdivision C of Division 5 of former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ would, apart from former section 160AOAA of that Act, apply in relation to an entity’s assessment for a year of income that ends before 1 July 2002.

             (2)  Former section 160AOAA of that Act does not prevent:

                     (a)  the making of a determination under that Subdivision on or after that date for an offset to reduce the entity’s income tax liability for that year of income; and

                     (b)  the operation of any provision in that Subdivision in relation to that determination.

             (3)  However, in working out the amount of that offset, any liabilities to pay franking deficit tax or deficit deferral tax that have been taken into account in working out a tax offset under section 205‑70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ must be disregarded.

##### <a id="208‑111"></a>208‑111  Converting former exempting company’s exempting account balance on 30 June 2002

             (1)  This section has effect for the purposes of working out the following for a company that was a former exempting company (as defined in former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) at the end of 30 June 2002:

                     (a)  whether the company has an exempting surplus or an exempting deficit for the purposes of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ at a time after 30 June 2002;

                     (b)  the company’s class A exempting account balance (as defined in that Part) at a time after 30 June 2002;

                     (c)  the company’s class C exempting account balance (as defined in that Part) at a time after 30 June 2002.

Class A exempting surplus at the end of 30 June 2002

             (2)  If the company had a class A exempting surplus (as defined in former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) at the end of 30 June 2002:

                     (a)  a class A exempting debit equal to the surplus is taken to have arisen immediately before the end of 30 June 2002 for the purposes of that Part; and

                     (b)  an exempting credit of the amount worked out using the formula is taken to have arisen at the start of 1 July 2002 in the exempting account that the company has under section 208‑110 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

Note:          Section 205‑5 (with former sections 160APU and 160AQCNM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) may affect whether the company had such a surplus at the end of 30 June 2002 and the amount of that surplus, but this section does not (because this section affects the company’s exempting account balance only after then).

Class C exempting surplus at the end of 30 June 2002

             (3)  If the company had a class C exempting surplus (as defined in former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) at the end of 30 June 2002:

                     (a)  a class C exempting debit equal to the surplus is taken to have arisen immediately before the end of 30 June 2002 for the purposes of that Part; and

                     (b)  an exempting credit of the amount worked out using the formula is taken to have arisen at the start of 1 July 2002 in the exempting account that the company has under section 208‑110 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

Note:          Section 205‑5 (with former sections 160APU and 160AQCNM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) may affect whether the company had such a surplus at the end of 30 June 2002 and the amount of that surplus, but this section does not (because this section affects the company’s exempting account balance only after then).

Class A exempting deficit at end of 30 June 2002

             (4)  If the company had a class A exempting deficit (as defined in former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) at the end of 30 June 2002 and its 2001‑02 franking year (as defined in that Part) ended earlier:

                     (a)  a class A exempting credit equal to the deficit is taken to have arisen at the end of 30 June 2002 for the purposes of that Part; and

                     (b)  an exempting debit of the amount worked out using the formula is taken to have arisen at the start of 1 July 2002 in the exempting account that the company has under section 208‑110 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00662/Html/5916c2a7-00b5-44ae-a4dc-b084225da50a_files/image020.gif)

Note:          If the company’s 2001‑02 franking year ended at the end of 30 June 2002 and it would have had a class A exempting deficit at that time apart from former section 160AQCNO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, that section will have eliminated the deficit and either:

(a)    increased the company’s liability for franking deficit tax; or

(b)    reduced the franking credit arising under section 205‑10 of this Act in the franking account the company has under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Class C exempting deficit at end of 30 June 2002

             (5)  If the company had a class C exempting deficit (as defined in former Part IIIAA of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) at the end of 30 June 2002 and its 2001‑02 franking year (as defined in that Part) ended earlier:

                     (a)  a class C exempting credit equal to the deficit is taken to have arisen at the end of 30 June 2002 for the purposes of that Part; and

                     (b)  an exempting debit of the amount worked out using the formula is taken to have arisen at the start of 1 July 2002 in the exempting account that the company has under section 208‑110 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

Note:          If the company’s 2001‑02 franking year ended at the end of 30 June 2002 and it would have had a class C exempting deficit at that time apart from former section 160AQCNO of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, that section will have eliminated the deficit and either:

(a)    increased the company’s liability for franking deficit tax; or

(b)    reduced the franking credit arising under section 205‑10 of this Act in the franking account the company has under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="214‑1"></a>214‑1  Application

                   This Division  applies to a corporate tax entity if a liability to pay franking deficit tax arises for the entity under section 205‑25 of this Act because of events that occur within a period of 12 months ending on 30 June in any year (the **_balancing period_**).

##### <a id="214‑5"></a>214‑5  Entity must give a franking return

             (1)  The entity must give the Commissioner a franking return for the balancing period setting out the following information before the end of the month immediately following the end of the period:

                     (a)  if the entity is a franking entity at the end of the balancing period—its franking account balance at the end of the period; and

                     (b)  if the entity ceases to be a franking entity during the balancing period—its franking account balance immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity; and

                     (c)  the amount (if any) of franking deficit tax that the entity is liable to pay under section 205‑25 of this Act because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the balancing period.

             (2)  The return must be in writing in the approved form.

##### <a id="214‑10"></a>214‑10  Notice to a specific corporate tax entity

             (1)  The Commissioner may give the entity a written notice requiring the entity to give the Commissioner a franking return for the balancing period.

             (2)  The entity must comply with the requirement within the time specified in the notice, or within any further time allowed by the Commissioner.

             (3)  The entity must comply with the requirement regardless of whether the entity has given, or has been required to give, the Commissioner a return under section 214‑5.

##### <a id="214‑15"></a>214‑15  Effect of a refund on franking returns

If no franking return is outstanding

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the entity receives a refund of income tax; and

                     (b)  the receipt of the refund gives rise to a liability, or an increased liability, to pay franking deficit tax because of the operation of subsection 205‑30(2) or (3) of this Act; and

                     (c)  when the refund is received, the entity does not have a franking return that is outstanding for the balancing period in which the liability arose;

the entity must give the Commissioner a franking return for the period within 14 days after the refund is received.

Refund received within 14 days before an outstanding franking return is due

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the entity receives a refund of income tax; and

                     (b)  the receipt of the refund gives rise to a liability, or an increased liability, to pay franking deficit tax because of the operation of subsection 205‑30(2) or (3) of this Act; and

                     (c)  when the refund is received, the entity does not have a franking return that is outstanding for the balancing period in which the liability arose; and

                     (d)  the entity receives the refund within the period of 14 days ending on the day by which the outstanding return must be given to the Commissioner;

the entity may, instead of accounting for the liability, or increased liability, in the outstanding return, account for it in a further return given to the Commissioner within 14 days after the refund is received.

Meaning of **outstanding**

             (3)  A franking return for a balancing period is **_outstanding_** at a particular time if each of the following is true at that time:

                     (a)  the entity has been required to give a franking return for the period;

                     (b)  the time within which the franking return must be given has not yet passed;

                     (c)  the franking return has not yet been given.

##### <a id="214‑20"></a>214‑20  Franking returns for the income year

             (1)  A franking return for a balancing period  is in addition to any franking return that the entity is required to give to the Commissioner under Subdivision 214‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the income year in which the balancing period ends.

             (2)  However, if an entity is required to give a franking return for a balancing period, it is not required to include in its franking return for the income year in which that period ends anything that should have been included in the franking return for the balancing period.

##### <a id="214‑25"></a>214‑25  Commissioner may make a franking assessment

             (1)  The Commissioner may make an assessment of:

                     (a)  if the entity is a franking entity at the end of the balancing period—its franking account balance at the end of the period; and

                     (b)  if the entity ceases to be a franking entity during the balancing period—its franking account balance immediately before it ceased to be a franking entity; and

                     (c)  the amount (if any) of franking deficit tax that the entity is liable to pay under section 205‑25 of this Act because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the balancing period.

This is a **_franking assessment_** for the entity for the balancing period.

             (2)  The Commissioner must give the entity notice of the assessment as soon as practicable after making the assessment.

             (3)  The notice may be included in a notice of any other assessment under this Act.

##### <a id="214‑30"></a>214‑30  Commissioner taken to have made a franking assessment on first return

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  the entity gives the Commissioner a franking return under section 214‑5 or 214‑10 of this Act on a particular day (the **_return day_**); and

                     (b)  the return is the first franking return given to the Commissioner by the entity for the balancing period; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner has not already made a franking assessment for the entity for that period;

the Commissioner is taken to have made a franking assessment for the entity for the period on the return day, and to have assessed:

                     (d)  the entity’s franking account balance at a particular time as that stated in the return as the balance at that time; and

                     (e)  the amount (if any) of franking deficit tax payable by the entity because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the period as those stated in the return.

             (2)  The return is taken to be notice of the assessment signed by the Commissioner and given to the entity on the return day.

##### <a id="214‑35"></a>214‑35  Amendments within 3 years of the original assessment

             (1)  The Commissioner may amend a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period at any time during the period of 3 years after the original assessment day for the entity for the period.

             (2)  The **_original assessment day_** for the entity for the balancing period is the day on which the first franking assessment for the entity for the period is made.

##### <a id="214‑40"></a>214‑40  Amended assessments are treated as franking assessments

                   Once an amended franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period is made, it is taken to be a **_franking assessment_** for the entity for the period.

##### <a id="214‑45"></a>214‑45  Further return as a result of a refund affecting a franking deficit tax liability

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period has been made; and

                     (b)  on a particular day (the **_further return day_**) the entity gives the Commissioner a further return for the balancing period under subsection 214‑15(1) of this Act (because the entity has received a refund of income tax that affects its liability to pay franking deficit tax);

the Commissioner is taken to have amended the entity’s franking assessment on the further return day, and to have assessed:

                     (c)  the entity’s franking account balance at a particular time as that stated in the further return as the balance at that time; and

                     (d)  the amount of franking deficit tax payable by the entity because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the period as those stated in the further return.

             (2)  The further return is taken to be notice of the amended assessment signed by the Commissioner and given to the entity on the further return day.

##### <a id="214‑50"></a>214‑50  Later amendments—on request

                   The Commissioner may amend a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period after the end of a period of 3 years after the original franking assessment day if, within that 3 year period:

                     (a)  the entity applies for the amendment; and

                     (b)  the entity gives the Commissioner all the information necessary for making the amendment.

##### <a id="214‑55"></a>214‑55  Later amendments—failure to make proper disclosure

                   If:

                     (a)  the entity does not make a full and true disclosure to the Commissioner of the information necessary for a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period; and

                     (b)  in making the assessment, the Commissioner makes an under‑assessment; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner is not of the opinion that the under‑assessment is due to fraud or evasion;

the Commissioner may amend the assessment at any time during the period of 6 years after the original franking assessment day.

##### <a id="214‑60"></a>214‑60  Later amendments—fraud or evasion

                   If:

                     (a)  the entity does not make a full and true disclosure to the Commissioner of the information necessary for a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period; and

                     (b)  in making the assessment, the Commissioner makes an under‑assessment; and

                     (c)  the Commissioner is of the opinion that the under‑assessment is due to fraud or evasion;

the Commissioner may amend the assessment at any time.

##### <a id="214‑65"></a>214‑65  Further amendment of an amended particular

                   If:

                     (a)  a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period has been amended (the **_first amendment_**) in any particular; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner is of the opinion that it would be just to further amend the assessment in that particular so as to reduce the assessment;

the Commissioner may do so within a period of 3 years after the first amendment.

##### <a id="214‑70"></a>214‑70  Other later amendments

                   In a case not covered by sections 214‑50, 214‑55, 214‑60 or 214‑65, the Commissioner may amend the franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period after the period of 3 years after the original assessment day has expired, but not so as to reduce the assessment.

##### <a id="214‑75"></a>214‑75  Amendment on review etc.

                   Nothing in this Division prevents the amendment of a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period:

                     (a)  to give effect to a decision on a review or appeal; or

                     (b)  to reduce the assessment as a result of an objection made under this Act or pending an appeal or review.

##### <a id="214‑80"></a>214‑80  Notice of amendments

             (1)  If the Commissioner amends the entity’s franking assessment for the balancing period, the Commissioner must give the entity notice of the amendment as soon as practicable after making the amendment.

             (2)  The notice may be included in a notice of any other assessment under this Act.

##### <a id="214‑85"></a>214‑85  Validity of assessment

                   The validity of a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period is not affected because any of the provisions of this Act (as defined in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_) have not been complied with.

##### <a id="214‑90"></a>214‑90  Objections

                   If a corporate tax entity is dissatisfied with a franking assessment made in relation to the entity under this Division, the entity may object against the assessment in the manner set out in Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### <a id="214‑95"></a>214‑95  Evidence

                   Section 177 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies as if:

                     (a)  a reference in that section to a return included a reference to a franking return under this Division; and

                     (b)  a reference in that section to an assessment or a notice of assessment included a reference to a franking assessment or a notice of a franking assessment (as required) under this Division.

##### <a id="214‑100"></a>214‑100  Due date for payment of franking tax

General rule

             (1)  Unless this section provides otherwise, franking deficit tax assessed for the entity because of events that have occurred, or are taken to have occurred, during the balancing period is due and payable on the last day of the month immediately following the end of the balancing period.

Amended assessments—other than because of deficit deferral

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the Commissioner amends a franking assessment for the entity for the balancing period (the **_earlier assessment_**) other than because of the operation of section 214‑30 (an amendment because of a refund of tax that affects franking deficit tax liability); and

                     (b)  the amount of franking deficit tax payable under the amended assessment exceeds the amount of franking deficit tax payable under the earlier assessment;

the excess amount is due and payable one month after the day on which the assessment was amended.

Tax payable because of deficit deferral

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the entity receives a refund of income tax; and

                     (b)  the receipt of the refund gives rise to a liability, or an increased liability, to pay franking deficit tax because of the operation of subsection 205‑30(2) or (3);

the franking deficit tax or, if there is an increase in an existing liability to pay franking deficit tax, the difference between the original liability and the increased liability, is due and payable on:

                     (c)  if the entity accounts for the liability, or increased liability, in a franking return that is outstanding for the balancing period in which the liability arose—the day on which the outstanding return is required to be given to the Commissioner; or

                     (d)  in any other case—14 days after the day on which the refund was received.

##### <a id="214‑105"></a>214‑105  General interest charge

                   If:

                     (a)  franking deficit tax that is payable by the entity remains unpaid after the time by which it is due and payable; and

                     (b)  the Commissioner has not allocated the unpaid amount to an RBA;

the entity is liable to pay the general interest charge on the unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

                     (c)  starts at the beginning of the day on which the franking deficit tax was due to be paid; and

                     (d)  ends at the end of the last day on which, at the end of the day, any of the following remains unpaid:

                              (i)  the franking deficit tax;

                             (ii)  general interest charge on any of the franking deficit tax.

Note:          The general interest charge is worked out under Part IIA of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_.

##### <a id="214‑110"></a>214‑110  Refunds of amounts overpaid

                   Section 172 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies for the purposes of this Division as if references in that section to tax included references to franking deficit tax.

##### <a id="214‑120"></a>214‑120  Record keeping

                   Section 262A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies for the purposes of this Division as if:

                     (a)  the reference in that section to a person carrying on a business were a reference to a corporate tax entity; and

                     (b)  the reference in paragraph (2)(a) of that section to the person’s income and expenditure were a reference to:

                              (i)  the entity’s franking account balance; and

                             (ii)  the entity’s liability to pay franking tax; and

                     (c)  paragraph (5)(a) of that section were omitted.

##### <a id="214‑125"></a>214‑125  Power of Commissioner to obtain information

                   Section 264 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies for the purposes of this Division as if the reference in paragraph (1)(b) of that section to a person’s income or assessment were a reference to a matter relevant to the administration or operation of this Division.

##### <a id="214‑135"></a>214‑135  Interpretation

                   If an expression is defined in this Division, it has the meaning given in that definition, and not the meaning given in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

### Division 219—Imputation for life insurance companies

**Table of sections**

219‑40      Reversing and replacing (on tax paid basis) certain franking credits that arose before 1 July 2002

219‑45      Reversing (on tax paid basis) certain franking debits that arose before 1 July 2002

##### <a id="219‑40"></a>219‑40  Reversing and replacing (on tax paid basis) certain franking credits that arose before 1 July 2002

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a franking credit arose before 1 July 2002 in the franking account of a life insurance company under former section 160APVJ of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to a PAYG instalment in respect of an income year; and

                     (b)  the company’s assessment day (the **_assessment day_**) for that income year occurs on or after 1 July 2002; and

                     (c)  the company has a franking account (the **_new franking account_**) under section 205‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  A franking debit of the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula is taken to have arisen in the new franking account on the assessment day:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00662/Html/5916c2a7-00b5-44ae-a4dc-b084225da50a_files/image025.gif)

where:

                    <a name="amount-1936-act-crite"></a>**_amount of the 1936 Act credit_** means the amount of the franking credit mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

             (3)  On the assessment day, a franking credit of the amount mentioned in item 2 of the table in section 219‑15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ arises in the new franking account in relation to a payment of the PAYG instalment mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) of this section that was made before 1 July 2002.

Note:          On the assessment day, the franking credit mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) is therefore:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>reversed by the franking debit arising under subsection (2); and

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>replaced with a franking credit arising under subsection (3).

##### <a id="219‑45"></a>219‑45  Reversing (on tax paid basis) certain franking debits that arose before 1 July 2002

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a franking debit arose before 1 July 2002 in the franking account of a life insurance company under former section 160AQCNCE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to a PAYG instalment variation credit in respect of an income year; and

                     (b)  the company’s assessment day (the **_assessment day_**) for that income year occurs on or after 1 July 2002; and

                     (c)  the company has a franking account (the **_new franking account_**) under section 205‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  A franking credit of the amount worked out in accordance with the following formula is taken to have arisen in the new franking account on 1 July 2002:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00662/Html/5916c2a7-00b5-44ae-a4dc-b084225da50a_files/image026.gif)

where:

                    <a name="amount-1936-act-debit"></a>**_amount of the 1936 Act debit_** means the amount of the franking debit mentioned in paragraph (1)(a).

Note:          As the effects of former sections 160AQCNCE and 160APVN of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are not duplicated in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, this section ensures that a debit arising under former section 160AQCNCE before 1 July 2002 is reversed on a tax paid basis on that date if it has not been reversed under former section 160APVN before that date.

### Division 220—Imputation for NZ resident companies and related companies

##### <a id="220‑501"></a>220‑501  Franking and exempting accounts of new former exempting entities

             (1)  This section has effect if:

                     (a)  a company (the **_Australian company_**) that is an Australian resident becomes a former exempting entity at a time (the **_switch time_**) because of:

                              (i)  an NZ franking choice by a company (the **_NZ company_**); and

                             (ii)  Division 220 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  the NZ franking choice comes into force at the start of the NZ company’s income year including 1 April 2003; and

                     (c)  at the switch time there is a franking surplus in the Australian company’s franking account; and

                     (d)  at the switch time the Australian company is a 100% subsidiary of a company (the **_NZ parent company_**) that:

                              (i)  is not a 100% subsidiary of another company that is a member of the same wholly‑owned group; and

                             (ii)  is a post‑choice NZ franking company; and

                     (e)  there is a period for which all these requirements are met:

                              (i)  the period must start as soon as possible after 7.30 pm by legal time in the Australian Capital   Territory on 13 May 1997 and end immediately before the switch time;

                             (ii)  the Australian company must have been a 100% subsidiary of the NZ parent company for the whole of the period;

                            (iii)  the Australian company must meet either or both of the conditions in subsections (2) and (3) for the whole of the period;

                            (iv)  the NZ parent company must meet the condition in subsection (4) for the whole of the period.

Conditions relating to the Australian company

             (2)  One condition relating to the Australian company is that the company would not have been effectively owned by prescribed persons as described in sections 208‑25 to 208‑45 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if:

                     (a)  those sections and sections 220‑505 and 220‑510 of that Act had applied throughout the period; and

                     (b)  an accountable membership interest or accountable partial interest in the Australian company had, at a time in the period, been held by, or indirectly for the benefit of, a post‑choice NZ franking company if, at that time:

                              (i)  the interest was held by, or indirectly for the benefit of, a company (the **_interest holder_**); and

                             (ii)  the interest holder was an NZ resident or would have been one had section 220‑20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, and section 995‑1 of that Act so far as it relates to section 220‑20 of that Act, applied throughout the period.

             (3)  The other condition relating to the Australian company is that the company was a 100% subsidiary of a company that:

                     (a)  was a listed public company; and

                     (b)  was an NZ resident or would have been one had section 220‑20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, and section 995‑1 of that Act so far as it relates to section 220‑20 of that Act, applied throughout the period.

Condition relating to the NZ parent company

             (4)  The condition relating to the NZ parent company is that it:

                     (a)  was not a 100% subsidiary of another company that was a member of the same wholly‑owned group; and

                     (b)  was an NZ resident or would have been one had section 220‑20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, and section 995‑1 of that Act so far as it relates to section 220‑20 of that Act, applied throughout the period.

Franking credits for the period remain franking credits

             (5)  A franking credit arises in the Australian company’s franking account immediately after the switch time.

Note:          This franking credit will partly or fully offset the franking debit that arises under item 1 of the table in section 208‑145 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because the Australian company becomes a former exempting entity at the switch time.

Franking credits for the period do not become exempting credits

             (6)  An exempting debit arises in the Australian company’s exempting account immediately after the switch time.

Note:          This exempting debit will partly or fully offset the exempting credit that arises under item 1 of the table in section 208‑115 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ because the Australian company becomes a former exempting entity at the switch time.

Amount of franking credit and exempting debit

             (7)  Work out the amount of the franking credit arising under subsection (5) and the exempting debit arising under subsection (6) using the table:

247‑25      The percentage method

##### <a id="247‑5"></a>247‑5  Interim apportionment methodology

                   The methodology set out in this Subdivision must be used to work out how much of an amount that a borrower incurs under or in respect of a capital protected borrowing is reasonably attributable to the capital protection provided under the capital protected borrowing if the capital protected borrowing is entered into or extended at or after 9.30 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 16 April 2003 and before 1 July 2007.

Note:          To work out how much of such an amount is reasonably attributable to the capital protection provided under a capital protected borrowing entered into on or after 1 July 2007, see Division 247 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="247‑10"></a>247‑10  Products listed on the Australian Stock Exchange that have explicit put options

             (1)  For a capital protected borrowing that:

                     (a)  is an instalment warrant listed on the Australian Stock Exchange; and

                     (b)  contains an explicit put option that permits the underlying investment to be sold for at least the amount borrowed or amount of credit provided and has a separate price that reasonably reflects the market value of that option;

subsection (2) applies.

             (2)  If an amount is incurred:

                     (a)  to acquire the capital protected borrowing in the primary market; or

                     (b)  at a reset date of the borrowing under the capital protected borrowing;

the amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection is the amount specified by the lender under the capital protected borrowing as the cost of the put option.

             (3)  For a capital protected borrowing acquired on the secondary market, the amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for an income year is worked out in accordance with subsection (4) or (5).

             (4)  If the market value of the underlying security at the time of acquisition is greater than the amount of the borrowing, the amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection is:

                     (a)  the sum of the market value of the instalment warrant and the amount of the borrowing or amount of credit provided; less

                     (b)  the sum of the market value of the underlying security and so much of the amount incurred as is attributable to pre‑paid interest.

             (5)  If the market value of the underlying security at the time of acquisition is equal to or less than the amount of the borrowing or amount of credit provided, the amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection is:

                     (a)  the market value of the instalment warrant; less

                     (b)  any pre‑paid interest.

             (6)  If the amount worked out in accordance with subsection (4) or (5) is less than nil, the amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection is nil.

##### <a id="247‑15"></a>247‑15  Other capital protected products

             (1)  If section 247‑10 does not apply, the total amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for an income year is the greater of the amount worked out using section 247‑20 (the indicator method) and section 247‑25 (the percentage method). If those amounts are the same, use either one.

             (2)  If an arrangement involves more than one amount incurred in an income year, the total amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for the year is distributed pro‑rata between those amounts incurred.

##### <a id="247‑20"></a>247‑20  The indicator method

             (1)  Work out the total amount incurred by the borrower under or in respect of the capital protected borrowing for the income year, ignoring amounts that are not in substance for capital protection or interest.

Example:    Amounts that would be ignored under subsection (1) include amounts that are in substance the repayment of a loan or credit, the payment of an application fee or brokerage commission and the payment of stamp duty or other tax.

             (2)  Work out the amount that would have been incurred by applying the relevant indicator rate to a borrowing or provision of credit of the same amount for the income year.

             (3)  If the subsection (1) amount exceeds the subsection (2) amount, the excess is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for the income year.

             (4)  The relevant indicator rate is:

                     (a)  for a capital protected borrowing based on a variable interest rate, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Indicator Rate for Personal Unsecured Loans—Variable Rate at the time the first payment for the income year was incurred; and

                     (b)  for another capital protected borrowing, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Indicator Rate for Personal Unsecured Loans—Fixed Rate at the time the borrowing was entered into.

##### <a id="247‑25"></a>247‑25  The percentage method

             (1)  Work out the total amount incurred by the borrower under or in respect of the capital protected borrowing for the income year, ignoring amounts that are not in substance for capital protection or interest.

Example:    Amounts that would be ignored under subsection (1) include amounts that are in substance the repayment of a loan or credit, the payment of an application fee or brokerage commission and the payment of stamp duty or other tax.

             (2)  The amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for the income year is this percentage of the total amount incurred for the income year:

                     (a)  40% if the term is 1 year or shorter; or

                     (b)  27.5% if the term is longer than 1 year but not longer than 2 years; or

                     (c)  20% if the term is longer than 2 years but not longer than 3 years; or

                     (d)  17.5% if the term is longer than 3 years but not longer than 4 years; or

                     (e)  15% if the term is longer than 4 years.

work out the amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection using the following method statement.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1\. Work out the total amount incurred by the borrower under or in respect of the capital protected borrowing for the income year, ignoring amounts that are not in substance for capital protection or interest.

Step 2\. Work out the total interest that would have been incurred for the income year on a borrowing or provision of credit of the same amount as under the capital protected borrowing at the rate applicable under either or both of subsections (2) and (3).

Step 3.   If the step 1 amount exceeds the step 2 amount, the excess is reasonably attributable to the capital protection for the income year.

* * *

Example:    Amounts that would be ignored under step 1 include amounts that are in substance the repayment of a loan or credit, the payment of an application fee or brokerage commission and the payment of stamp duty or other tax.

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  the capital protected borrowing is at a fixed rate for all or part of the term of the capital protected borrowing; and

                     (b)  that fixed rate is applicable to the capital protected borrowing for all or part of the income year;

use the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Indicator Lending Rate for Personal Unsecured Loans—Variable Rate (the **_personal unsecured loan rate_**) at the first time an amount covered by step 1 of the method statement in subsection (1) was incurred, in any income year, during the term of the capital protected borrowing or that part of the term.

                     (b)  in existence on 1 July 2013; and

                     (c)  to which section 247‑85 does not apply.

             (2)  Work out the amount that is reasonably attributable to the capital protection using the method statement in subsection 247‑75(1) and, for step 2 in that method statement, using the rate applicable under either or both of subsections (3) and (5) on or after 1 July 2013.

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  the capital protected borrowing is at a fixed rate for all or part of the term of the capital protected borrowing; and

                     (b)  that fixed rate is applicable to the capital protected borrowing for all or part of the income year that is on or after 1 July 2013;

use the rate worked out under subsection (4) at the first time an amount covered by step 1 of that method statement was incurred, in any income year, while the capital protected borrowing is at that fixed rate.

             (4)  The rate (the **_adjusted loan rate_**), at a particular time, is the sum of:

                     (a)  the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Indicator Lending Rate for Standard Variable Housing Loans at that time; and

                     (b)  100 basis points.

             (5)  If:

                     (a)  the capital protected borrowing is at a variable rate for all or part of the term of the capital protected borrowing; and

                     (b)  a variable rate is applicable to the capital protected borrowing for all or part of the income year that is on or after 1 July 2013;

use the average of the adjusted loan rates applicable during those parts of the income year when the capital protected borrowing is at a variable rate.

##### <a id="247‑85"></a>247‑85  Extensions and other changes

             (1)  This section applies to a capital protected borrowing entered into at or before the 2008 Budget time (including one covered by Subdivision 247‑A or section 247‑75) where, after that time, one or both of these events occurred:

                     (a)  the term of the capital protected borrowing is extended;

                             (ii)  where no superannuation income stream benefits have been paid from the superannuation interest after 30 June 2007—all payments from the interest on or before that day would have satisfied the requirement in subparagraph (i) if they had been paid after that day;

                     (c)  the holder of the superannuation interest turns 60, if:

                              (i)  none of the superannuation income stream benefits paid from the superannuation interest after 30 June 2007 consist of, or include, an element untaxed in the fund; or

                             (ii)  where no superannuation income stream benefits have been paid from the superannuation interest after 30 June 2007—all payments from the interest on or before that day would have satisfied the requirement in subparagraph (i) if they had been paid after that day.

                     (a)  the time just before the event mentioned in subsection (3) happens; or

                     (b)  if there are 2 or more such events—the time just before the earliest of those events happens.

             (6)  For the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), work out the tax free component of the superannuation interest as follows:

                     (a)  first, assume that:

                              (i)  an eligible termination payment had been made in respect of the holder of the interest just before the time mentioned in subsection (5); and

                             (ii)  the amount of the eligible termination payment had been equal to the value of the superannuation interest at that time;

                     (b)  next, work out the unused undeducted purchase price (within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of that term in subsection 27A(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ just before the commencement of this section, and disregarding paragraphs (b) and (c) of that definition) of the superannuation income stream, reduced by the tax free components (worked out under subsection (2)) of any benefits paid from the superannuation income stream after 30 June 2007;

The tax free component is equal to the sum of the amounts worked out under paragraphs (b) and (c).

          (6A)  Despite subsection (6), if:

                     (a)  at least one superannuation income stream benefit was paid from the superannuation income stream before 1 July 1994; or

for the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), the tax free component is equal to the amount worked out under paragraph (6)(b).

             (7)  For the purposes of paragraph (6)(c), disregard the value of the interest to the extent that it would consist, apart from this subsection, of the element untaxed in the fund of the taxable component of a superannuation benefit constituted by the eligible termination payment.

Commutation of superannuation income stream

             (8)  If the superannuation income stream has been wholly or partially commuted as mentioned in paragraph (3)(a), treat the applicable time for the purposes of subsection 307‑125(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to a superannuation benefit arising from the commutation as:

                     (c)  you change to an accruals accounting method for the changeover year.

             (2)  This section also sets out what happens to your ordinary income and general deductions, and deductions under section 25‑5 or 25‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, if:

                     (a)  you are not a small business entity for an income year (also the **_changeover year_**); and

                     (b)  you were using the STS accounting method for the income year before the changeover year; and

                     (c)  you change to an accruals accounting method for the changeover year.

             (3)  Any ordinary income that, apart from paragraph 328‑105(1)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(as in force immediately before its repeal by Schedule 2 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Act 2005_), you would have derived before the changeover year (while you were using the STS accounting method) and you have not included in your assessable income because you have not received it is included in your assessable income for the changeover year.

             (4)  Any general deductions, and deductions under section 25‑5 or 25‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, that, apart from paragraph 328‑105(1)(b) of that Act (as in force immediately before its repeal by Schedule 2 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 7) Act 2005_), you would have incurred before the changeover year (while you were using the STS accounting method) and that you have not deducted because you have not paid them can be deducted for the changeover year.

##### <a id="328‑120"></a>328‑120  Continuing to use the STS accounting method

             (1)  This section applies if:

You are not a small business entity for the 2009‑10 income year so you cannot continue to use the STS accounting method for that year. Because you cannot use the STS accounting method for the 2009‑10 income year, you will not be able to use it again for a later income year even if you are a small business entity for that later year.

Assets allocated to long life STS pool

             (2)  A depreciating asset of yours that had been allocated to your long life STS pool is treated as being allocated to your long life small business pool.

Choice not to allocate assets to long life STS pool

             (3)  If you made a choice, under subsection 328‑185(5) of old Subdivision 328‑D, not to have a depreciating asset allocated to your long life STS pool, the choice has effect for the purposes of subsection 328‑185(5) of new Subdivision 328‑D.

Note:          This means you cannot change the choice: see subsection 328‑185(6) of new Subdivision 328‑D.

##### <a id="328‑195"></a>328‑195  Opening pool balances for 2007‑08 income year

             (1)  This section applies if a depreciating asset of yours is treated as being allocated to your general small business pool or long life small business pool under section 328‑185.

             (2)  The opening pool balance of your general small business pool or long life small business pool for the 2007‑08 income year is taken to be the closing pool balance of your general STS pool or long life STS pool, as the case requires, for the 2006‑07 income year, reduced or increased by any adjustment required under section 328‑225 of new Subdivision 328‑D (about change in the business use of an asset).

             (3)  However, if:

                     (a)  you were not an STS taxpayer for the 2006‑07 income year (because you stopped being an STS taxpayer before that time); but

                     (b)  you are a small business entity for the 2007‑08 income year or a later income year and you choose to use new Subdivision 328‑D to deduct amounts for your depreciating assets for that income year;

the opening pool balance of your general small business pool or long life small business pool includes the sum of the taxable purpose proportions of the adjustable values of depreciating assets allocated to the pool under subsection 328‑185(3) of new Subdivision 328‑D for that year.

##### <a id="328‑200"></a>328‑200  General small business pool for the 2012‑13 income year

             (1)  This section applies for the purposes of applying Subdivision 328‑D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the 2012‑13 income year and later income years.

             (2)  A depreciating asset that had been allocated to your long life small business pool is treated as being allocated to your general small business pool.

             (3)  The opening pool balance of your general small business pool for the 2012‑13 income year is taken to be the sum of:

                     (a)  the closing pool balance of your general small business pool for the 2011‑12 income year, reduced or increased by any adjustment required under section 328‑225 of that Act; and

                     (b)  the closing pool balance of your long life small business pool for the 2011‑12 income year, reduced or increased by any adjustment required under that section.

             (2)  You cannot choose to use new Subdivision 328‑D to deduct amounts for your depreciating assets until at least 5 years after the income year for which you chose to stop being an STS taxpayer.

Note:          Subdivision 328‑D of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ continues to apply to depreciating assets that have been allocated to your small business pools even if you are not a small business entity, or do not choose to use that Subdivision, for an income year: see section 328‑220 of that Subdivision.

             (4)  Subsection 40‑75(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to the asset as if the first new income year were a change year (within the meaning of that subsection).

##### <a id="355‑610"></a>355‑610  Core technology that is not a depreciating asset

                   If the core technology is not a depreciating asset, you can deduct the undeducted expenditure in equal proportions over a period of 5 income years starting in the first income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011.

                   Division 393 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (about farm management deposits) applies to assessments for:

                     (a)  the 2010‑11 income year; and

                     (b)  later income years.

##### <a id="393‑5"></a>393‑5  Unrecouped FMD deduction

                   A reference in Division 393 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to a deduction under section 393‑5 of that Act for making a farm management deposit is taken to include a reference to a deduction under section 393‑10 in Schedule 2G to the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as in force just before the commencement of this section, if the deposit was made before the 2010‑11 income year.

##### <a id="393‑10"></a>393‑10  Unrecouped FMD deduction for deposits made as a result of section 25B of the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_

                   Despite subsection 393‑10(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, if:

                     (a)  no part of a farm management deposit has been repaid before a particular time; and

                     (b)  the deposit was made with an FMD provider as a result of a request to which section 25B of the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_, as in force on 21 February 2005, applied;

the **_unrecouped FMD deduction_** in respect of the deposit at that time is equal to the amount of the unrecouped deduction (within the meaning of the former subsection 159GA(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) in respect of the deposit immediately before it ceased to be a deposit under the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_.

Note:          This means that the unrecouped deduction relating to the deposit under the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_ continues to apply (by becoming an unrecouped FMD deduction) when the deposit is transferred to an FMD provider as a farm management deposit. The _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_ was repealed on 22 February 2005.

##### <a id="393‑27"></a>393‑27  Trustee may choose that a beneficiary is a chosen beneficiary of the trust

                     (a)  subsections 393‑40(1) to (4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ apply as if the day the deposit was made was the day on which the deposit was originally made under the _Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976_; and

                     (b)  subsection 393‑40(6) does not apply to the deposit.

             (2)  If a consolidated group came into existence after 1 July 2002 but before 1 July 2003:

                     (a)  the group is a **_transitional group_** if at least one entity that became a subsidiary member of the group on the day the group came into existence is a **_transitional entity_**; and

                     (b)  an entity is a transitional entity if:

                              (i)  at no time after 1 July 2002 and before the group came into existence was the entity a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the entity (the **_future head company_**) that became the head company of the group; or

                             (ii)  at some time during that period, the entity was a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the future head company and it remained such from the earliest time after 1 July 2002 when it was a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the future head company until the group came into existence.

Group formed during financial year starting on 1 July 2003

             (3)  If a consolidated group came into existence during the financial year starting on 1 July 2003:

                     (a)  the group is a **_transitional group_** if at least one entity that became a subsidiary member of the group on the day the group came into existence is a transitional entity; and

                     (b)  an entity is a **_transitional entity_** if:

                              (i)  just before 1 July 2003, it was a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the future head company; and

                             (ii)  it remained such from the earliest time after 1 July 2002 when it was a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the future head company until the group came into existence.

##### <a id="701‑5"></a>701‑5  Chosen transitional entity

             (1)  If a group is a transitional group, its head company may, subject to subsection (3), choose that the group’s transitional entity is a **_chosen transitional entity_**, or one or more of the group’s transitional entities are **_chosen transitional entities_**.

Period for making choice

             (2)  The choice must be made by the later of:

                     (a)  the day on which the head company must give the notice under section 703‑58 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (notice of choice to consolidate); and

                     (b)  the end of 31 December 2005.

Agreement of other entities required in certain cases

             (3)  If the choice is to be made after the end of the period mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) and before the end of the day mentioned in paragraph (2)(b), it cannot be made unless each entity in relation to which the conditions in subsection (5) are satisfied has agreed to it being made.

Choice is irrevocable in certain circumstances

             (4)  The choice cannot be revoked unless:

                     (a)  the revocation takes place before the end of 31 December 2005; and

                     (b)  each entity in relation to which the conditions in subsection (5) are satisfied has agreed to the revocation.

             (5)  For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the conditions are that:

                     (a)  the entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceased to be a subsidiary member of the group before the choice was made (in a subsection (3) case) or before the revocation took place (in a subsection (4) case); and

                     (b)  an asset became that of the leaving entity because section 701‑1 (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ ceased to apply when the leaving entity ceased to be a subsidiary member; and

                     (c)  the asset had become that of the head company because that section applied when a chosen transitional entity (whether or not the same entity as the leaving entity) became a subsidiary member.

##### <a id="701‑7"></a>701‑7  Working out the cost base or reduced cost base of a pre‑CGT asset after certain roll‑overs

                   Section 716‑855 applies for the purposes of this Division in the same way as that section applies for the purposes of Part 3‑90 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="701‑10"></a>701‑10  Interpretation

                   A reference in this Division to:

                     (a)  a provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  a consolidated group’s allocable cost amount for an entity;

is a reference to that provision as it applies to the group, or to the allocable cost amount as it is worked out for the entity, in accordance with Subdivision 705‑B of that Act and with this Division.

#### Subdivision 701‑B—Modified application of provisions

**Table of sections**

701‑15      Tax cost and trading stock value not set for assets of chosen transitional entities

701‑20      Working out allocable cost amount on formation for subsidiary members other than chosen transitional entities

701‑25      No operation of value shifting and loss transfer provisions to membership interests in chosen transitional entities

701‑32      No adjustment of amount of liabilities required in working out allocable cost amount

701‑35      Act, transaction or event giving rise to CGT event for pre‑formation roll‑over after 16 May 2002 to be disregarded if cost base etc. would be different

701‑40      When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group’s allocable cost amount, to increase terminating values of over‑depreciated assets

701‑45      When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group’s allocable cost amount, to use formation time market values, instead of terminating values, for certain pre‑CGT assets

701‑50      Increased allocable cost amount for leaving entity if it takes privatised asset brought into group by chosen transitional entity

##### <a id="701‑15"></a>701‑15  Tax cost and trading stock value not set for assets of chosen transitional entities

                   Section 701‑10 (cost to head company of assets of joining entity) and subsection 701‑35(4) (setting value of trading stock at tax‑neutral amount) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ do not apply to the assets of a chosen transitional entity.

Note:          The fact that the head company inherits the entity’s history under section 701‑5 of that Act when the entity becomes a subsidiary member of the group means that the entity’s assets would be treated as having the same cost as they would for the entity at that time.

##### <a id="701‑20"></a>701‑20  Working out allocable cost amount on formation for subsidiary members other than chosen transitional entities

When section applies

             (1)  This section applies if any of the transitional entities in the transitional group is a chosen transitional entity.

Allocable cost amount to be worked out in special way

             (2)  If this section applies, the group’s allocable cost amount for each of the entities, other than a chosen transitional entity, that become subsidiary members when the group comes into existence (each of which is a **_non‑chosen subsidiary_**) is worked out in a special way.

How to work out allocable cost amount

             (3)  The allocable cost amount for each non‑chosen subsidiary is the sum of:

                     (a)  the head company adjusted allocable amount for the non‑chosen subsidiary (see subsection (4)); and

                     (b)  for each sub‑group (see subsection (6)) that exists in relation to the non‑chosen subsidiary—the sub‑group’s notional allocable cost amount (see subsection(5)) for the non‑chosen subsidiary.

Head company adjusted allocable amount

             (4)  The **_head company adjusted allocable amount_** for the non‑chosen subsidiary is the amount that would be the transitional group’s allocable cost amount for that entity if;

                     (a)  the holding of all sub‑group membership interests were disregarded; and

                     (b)  only the following proportion of each of the step 2 to step 7 amounts in the table in section 705‑60 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ was taken into account:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00662/Html/5916c2a7-00b5-44ae-a4dc-b084225da50a_files/image028.gif)

                            where:

**_market value of all membership interests in non‑chosen subsidiary_** means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the non‑chosen subsidiary that are held by entities that become members of the group at that time.

**_market value of head company’s direct and indirect membership interests in non‑chosen subsidiary_** means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the non‑chosen subsidiary that the head company holds directly or indirectly through interposed entities that become subsidiary members of the group at that time and are not included in any sub‑group in relation to the non‑chosen subsidiary.

Sub‑group’s notional allocable cost amount

             (5)  For each sub‑group that exists in relation to the non‑chosen subsidiary, there is a **_sub‑group’s notional allocable cost amount_**. That amount is the amount that would be a consolidated group’s allocable cost amount for the non‑chosen subsidiary if:

                     (a)  the consolidated group came into existence at the same time as the transitional group and consisted only of the non‑chosen subsidiary and the entities comprising the sub‑group; and

                     (b)  the chosen transitional entity in the sub‑group were the head company of the consolidated group; and

                     (c)  the only membership interests that any entity held at or before that time in any other entity that became a member of the consolidated group were the sub‑group membership interests (see subsection (6)), and any such entity held those membership interests during the period when it actually held them; and

                     (d)  only the following proportion of each of the step 2 to step 7 amounts in the table in section 705‑60 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ was taken into account:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00662/Html/5916c2a7-00b5-44ae-a4dc-b084225da50a_files/image029.gif)

                            where:

**_market value of all membership interests in non‑chosen subsidiary_** means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the non‑chosen subsidiary that are held by entities that become members of the group at that time.

**_market value of chosen transitional entity’s direct and indirect membership interests in non‑chosen subsidiary_** means the market value, at the time the group comes into existence, of all membership interests in the non‑chosen subsidiary that the chosen transitional entity holds directly or indirectly through interposed entities that are included in the sub‑group.

Sub‑group and sub‑group membership interests

             (6)  If a chosen transitional entity holds membership interests in a non‑chosen subsidiary, either directly or indirectly through one or more other entities, each of which is a non‑chosen subsidiary:

                     (a)  the chosen transitional entity and each interposed non‑chosen subsidiary comprise a **_sub‑group_** in relation to the non‑chosen subsidiary (unless the non‑chosen subsidiary is included in a sub‑group in relation to another non‑chosen subsidiary); and

                     (b)  the following membership interests are the **_sub‑group membership interests_** in relation to the sub‑group:

                              (i)  the membership interests that the chosen transitional entity holds directly in the non‑chosen subsidiary or in any of the interposed non‑chosen subsidiaries;

                             (ii)  the membership interests that each interposed non‑chosen subsidiary holds directly in the non‑chosen subsidiary or in any of the other interposed non‑chosen subsidiaries.

##### <a id="701‑25"></a>701‑25  No operation of value shifting and loss transfer provisions to membership interests in chosen transitional entities

                   If any provision of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would, because of events that happened before the time the transitional group came into existence, apply to a CGT event that happens after that time to change the cost base or reduced cost base of  the members’ membership interests in a chosen transitional entity, the provision does not so apply.

Note:          For example, such a provision could otherwise apply where a loss transfer or value shift involving the entity has occurred.

##### <a id="701‑32"></a>701‑32  No adjustment of amount of liabilities required in working out allocable cost amount

             (1)  This section has effect for the purposes of applying section 705‑70 (step 2 of allocable cost amount) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in relation to a transitional entity.

             (2)  In spite of subsection 705‑70(1A) of that Act, if the amount of an accounting liability of the transitional entity would be different when it becomes an accounting liability of the transitional group, that difference is not taken into account in working out the amount of the liability.

##### <a id="701‑35"></a>701‑35  Act, transaction or event giving rise to CGT event for pre‑formation roll‑over after 16 May 2002 to be disregarded if cost base etc. would be different

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  after 16 May 2002 and before the transitional group came into existence, a CGT event happened in relation to an asset (the **_roll‑over asset_**) for which there was:

                              (i)  a roll‑over under Subdivision 126‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                             (ii)  roll‑over relief under section 40‑340 of that Act in a case covered by item 4 of the table in subsection (1) of that section; and

                     (b)  the cost base or reduced cost base of the roll‑over asset or any other asset that:

                              (i)  became an asset of the head company when the transitional group came into existence because subsection 701‑1(1) (the single entity rule) of that Act applies; or

                             (ii)  was otherwise an asset of the head company at that time;

                            differs at that time from what it would have been if the act, transaction or event that gave rise to the CGT event had not occurred in relation to the roll‑over asset;

then the provisions mentioned in subsection (2) apply as if the act, transaction or event had not occurred in relation to the roll‑over asset.

             (2)  The provisions are:

                     (a)  Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  provisions  of this Act modifying the effect of that Division.

          (2A)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the act, transaction or event mentioned in subsection (1) happened before a demerger and in connection with the demerger; and

                     (b)  before the transitional group came into existence, at least one of the following entities ceased to be a member of the demerger group because of the demerger:

                              (i)  the originating company in relation to the roll‑over, or the transferor in relation to the roll‑over relief;

                             (ii)  the recipient company, or the transferee in relation to the roll‑over relief; and

                     (c)  when the transitional group came into existence, at least one of those entities was _not_ a member of that group.

             (3)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:

                     (a)  the roll‑over asset is a membership interest in an entity (the **_test entity_**); and

                     (b)  when the CGT event happened:

                              (i)  the originating company in relation to the roll‑over, or the transferor in relation to the roll‑over relief, was a foreign resident; and

                             (ii)  the recipient company, or the transferee in relation to the roll‑over relief, was an Australian resident; and

                     (c)  when the transitional group came into existence, the test entity was a subsidiary member of the group, other than as a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary of the group.

##### <a id="701‑40"></a>701‑40  When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group’s allocable cost amount, to increase terminating values of over‑depreciated assets

             (1)  This section applies if an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group and the requirements of subsections (2) to (4) are satisfied.

Asset held at leaving time

             (2)  Just before the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member, it must, disregarding subsection 701‑1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, hold an asset.

Reduction of asset’s tax cost setting amount for over‑depreciation

             (3)  When the transitional group came into existence:

                     (a)  the asset must have become that of the head company of the transitional group because subsection 701‑1(1) of that Act applied in relation to a transitional entity; and

                     (b)  former section 705‑50 of that Act must have reduced by an amount (the **_reduction amount_**) the tax cost setting amount for the asset.

Asset held continuously within group

             (4)  The asset must, disregarding subsection 701‑1(1) of that Act, have been held at all times by the head company or a subsidiary member of the transitional group from when the transitional group came into existence until the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group.

Head company’s choice

             (6)  If this section applies, the head company may, in relation to the entity’s ceasing to be a subsidiary member, choose that the terminating valuefor the asset, that is to be used in applying step 1 of the table in section 711‑20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, is increased by so much of the reduction amount as the head company chooses.

##### <a id="701‑45"></a>701‑45  When entity leaves transitional group, head company may choose, for purposes of transitional group’s allocable cost amount, to use formation time market values, instead of terminating values, for certain pre‑CGT assets

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group; and

                     (b)  just before the transitional group came into existence, the entity that became the head company held a pre‑CGT asset; and

                     (c)  that holding of the asset did not occur as a result of a CGT event:

                              (i)  for which there was a roll‑over under Subdivision 126‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                             (ii)  that occurred after 11.45 am by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory on 21 September 1999; and

                     (d)  just before the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group, the asset is still a pre‑CGT asset and is held by the head company only because the entity is taken by subsection 701‑1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be a part of the head company.

             (2)  If this section applies, the head company may, in relation to the entity’s ceasing to be a subsidiary member, choose that the terminating value for the asset, that is to be used in applying step 1 of the table in section 711‑20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, is equal to its market value just before the transitional group came into existence.

##### <a id="701‑50"></a>701‑50  Increased allocable cost amount for leaving entity if it takes privatised asset brought into group by chosen transitional entity

Application

             (1)  This section provides for an addition to the step 1 amount for working out under section 711‑20 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ the allocable cost amount for an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) that ceases to be a subsidiary member of the transitional group at a time (the **_leaving time_**), if:

                     (a)  the head company of the group holds an asset at the leaving time because the leaving entity is taken by subsection 701‑1(1) of that Act to be a part of the head company; and

                     (b)  the head company started to hold the asset because of that subsection when a chosen transitional entity became a subsidiary member of the group.

If entity sale situation affected asset’s cost for chosen transitional entity

             (2)  If:

                     (a)  at a time before the chosen transitional entity became a subsidiary member of the transitional group:

                              (i)  all of that entity’s ordinary income and statutory income was not assessable income; and

                             (ii)  that entity held the asset; and

                     (b)  just after that time, some or all of that entity’s ordinary income and statutory income became assessable income because another entity that later became a member of the transitional group purchased all the membership interests in the entity; and

                     (c)  the amount of the purchase price reasonably attributable to the asset exceeded the amount worked out under subsection (3);

the excess is added to the step 1 amount.

             (3)  Work out the amount for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) using the following table:

             (4)  If:

                     (a)  on or after 4 August 1997, an entity (whether the chosen transitional entity or another entity) acquired the asset in connection with the acquisition of a business from the tax exempt vendor (within the meaning of those terms given by Division 58 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, as that Division applied to the acquisition); and

                     (b)  because of the acquisition, that Division directly or indirectly affected how much the chosen transitional entity could deduct for the asset; and

                     (d)  that amount is less than it would have been apart from that provision;

the difference is added to the step 1 amount.

Note 1:       As originally enacted, Division 58 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applied to acquisitions on or after 4 August 1997\. That Act was later amended to replace Division 58, with the replacement Division 58 applying to acquisitions on or after 1 July 2001.

Note 2:       Division 58 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ may, for example, have _indirectly_ affected how much the chosen transitional entity could deduct for the asset because:

(a)    that Division affected the amount that could be deducted by an entity that held the asset before the chosen transitional entity; and

(b)    that effect extended to the chosen transitional entity because of roll‑over relief.

### Division 701A—Modified application of provisions of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 for entities with continuing majority ownership from 27 June 2002 until joining a consolidated group

**Table of sections**

701A‑1     Continuing majority‑owned entity, designated group etc.

701A‑5     Modified application of Part 3‑90 of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to trading stock of continuing majority‑owned entity

701A‑7     Modified application of Part 3‑90 of _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to registered emissions units of continuing majority‑owned entity

701A‑10   Modified application of Part 3‑90 of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to certain internally generated assets of continuing majority‑owned entity

##### <a id="701A‑1"></a>701A‑1  Continuing majority‑owned entity, designated group etc.

Continuing majority‑owned entity and designated group

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  an entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at any time on or after 1 July 2002; and

                     (b)  a person or persons continued to be the majority owners (see subsection (2)) of the entity from the start of 27 June 2002 until the entity became a subsidiary member of the group;

the entity is a **_continuing majority‑owned entity_** and the group is the entity’s **_designated group_**.

Majority owners of an entity

             (2)  A person or persons are the **_majority owners_** of an entity if they beneficially own, directly or indirectly through one or more interposed entities, membership interests in the entity whose market value is more than 50% of the market value of all of the membership interests in the entity.

Interposed non‑fixed trust to be treated as fixed trust

             (3)  For the purposes of subsection (2), if the interposed entity or any of the interposed entities is a trust that is not a fixed trust:

                     (a)  it is treated as if it were a fixed trust; and

                     (b)  all of its objects are treated as if they were beneficiaries of that trust with equal interests in it.

##### <a id="701A‑5"></a>701A‑5  Modified application of Part 3‑90 of _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to trading stock of continuing majority‑owned entity

             (1)  The operation of Part 3‑90 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is modified in accordance with this section  in relation to each asset of a continuing majority‑owned entity that is trading stock just before the entity becomes a subsidiary member of the entity’s designated group.

Continuing majority‑owned entity to revalue its trading stock under normal provisions

             (2)  For the entity core purposes:

                     (a)  subsection 701‑35(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not apply in relation to the asset; and

                     (b)  instead, the value of the asset at the end of the income year that ends, or, if section 701‑30 of that Act applies, of the income year that is taken by subsection (3) of that section to end, is the value determined in accordance with sections 70‑45 to 70‑70 of that Act.

For head company, trading stock to be retained cost base asset with tax cost setting amount equal to entity’s year‑end valuation

             (3)  For the head company core purposes when the continuing majority‑owned entity becomes a subsidiary member of the designated group, the asset is a retained cost base asset whose tax cost setting amount is equal to the value applicable in accordance with paragraph (2)(b).

##### <a id="701A‑7"></a>701A‑7  Modified application of Part 3‑90 of _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to registered emissions units of continuing majority‑owned entity

             (1)  The operation of Part 3‑90 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ is modified in accordance with this section in relation to each asset of a continuing majority‑owned entity that is a registered emissions unit just before the entity becomes a subsidiary member of the entity’s designated group.

Continuing majority‑owned entity to revalue its registered emissions units under normal provisions

             (2)  For the entity core purposes:

                     (a)  subsection 701‑35(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ does not apply in relation to the asset; and

                     (b)  instead, the value of the asset at the end of the income year that ends, or, if section 701‑30 of that Act applies, of the income year that is taken by subsection (3) of that section to end, is the value determined in accordance with sections 420‑51 to 420‑58 of that Act.

For head company, registered emissions units to be retained cost base asset with tax cost setting amount equal to entity’s year‑end valuation

             (3)  For the head company core purposes when the continuing majority‑owned entity becomes a subsidiary member of the designated group, the asset is a retained cost base asset whose tax cost setting amount is equal to the value applicable in accordance with paragraph (2)(b).

##### <a id="701A‑10"></a>701A‑10  Modified application of Part 3‑90 of _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to certain internally generated assets of continuing majority‑owned entity

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  because subsection 701‑1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies, a depreciating asset becomes that of the head company of a continuing majority‑owned entity’s designated group when the entity becomes a subsidiary member of that group; and

                     (b)  the continuing majority‑owned entity’s terminating value for the asset is less than the asset’s tax cost setting amount; and

                     (c)  the asset existed at the start of 27 June 2002; and

                     (d)  more than half of the expenditure incurred in constructing or creating the asset was of a revenue nature and allowable as a deduction to the entity (whether or not the continuing majority‑owned entity) that constructed or created the asset; and

                     (e)  for every balancing adjustment event occurring for the asset before the continuing majority‑owned entity became a subsidiary member of the group, there was roll‑over relief under section 40‑340 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Reduced depreciation deductions etc. for head company

(2)  If this section applies, for the head company core purposes:

                     (a)  while the asset is, because subsection 701‑1(1) of that Act applies, that of the head company of the designated group, for the purpose of working out deductions for the asset’s decline in value under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, its tax cost setting amount is taken to be equal to the continuing majority‑owned entity’s terminating value for the asset; and

                     (b)  if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset, or the head company ceases to hold the asset because an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group, and:

                              (i)  the deductions for its decline in value up to that time worked out on the basis in paragraph (a);

                            are less than:

                             (ii)  the deductions that would have been worked out using its actual tax cost setting amount;

                            then:

                            (iii)  if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset—the shortfall is allowable as a deduction to the head company for the income year in which it ceases to hold the asset; or

                            (iv)  if the head company ceases to hold the asset because an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group—the group’s allocable cost amount worked out under section 711‑30 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the entity is increased by the shortfall.

Note:       The asset’s actual tax cost setting amount would be used for the purpose of working out any balancing adjustment for a balancing adjustment event or for working out the terminating value of the asset under Division 711 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Reduced depreciation deductions etc. for acquirer from head company

(3)  If:

                     (a)  the asset is acquired by another entity (a **_new asset holder_**) from the head company; and

                     (b)  at the time of the acquisition:

                              (i)  either party to the acquisition controls (for value shifting purposes) the other; or

                             (ii)  a third entity controls (for value shifting purposes) the parties to the acquisition; and

                     (c)  the following amount:

                              (i)  the asset’s adjustable value (the **_roll‑over adjustable value_**) just before the acquisition, worked out on the assumption that the head company had acquired the asset for an amount equal to the continuing majority‑owned entity’s terminating value for the asset;

                            is less than:

                             (ii)  the asset’s cost to the new asset holder;

then the consequences in subsection (4) occur.

(4)  The consequences are as follows:

                     (a)  while the asset is held by the new asset holder, for the purpose of working out deductions for the asset’s decline in value under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the acquisition by the new asset holder is taken to have been for an amount equal to the asset’s roll‑over adjustable value;

                     (b)  if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset and:

                              (i)  the deductions for its decline in value up to that time, worked out on the basis in paragraph (a);

                            are less than:

                             (ii)  the deductions that would otherwise have been worked out;

                            then the shortfall is allowable as a deduction to the new asset holder for the income year in which it ceases to hold the asset.

Reduced depreciation deductions etc. for entity that ceases to be a subsidiary member

(5)  If:

                     (a)  the asset becomes that of an entity (a **_new asset holder_**) other than the head company because subsection 701‑1(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ ceases to apply when the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the designated group as a result of a third entity (the **_buyer of the new asset holder_**) acquiring some or all of the membership interests in the new asset holder; and

                     (b)  at the time of the acquisition:

                              (i)  the buyer of the new asset holder controls (for value shifting purposes) the head company of the designated group, or vice versa; or

                             (ii)  a third entity controls (for value shifting purposes) the head company of the designated group and the buyer of the new asset holder; and

                     (c)  the following amount:

                              (i)  the asset’s adjustable value (the **_roll‑over adjustable value_**) just before the cessation, worked out on the assumption that the head company had acquired the asset for an amount equal to the continuing majority‑owned entity’s terminating value for the asset;

                            is less than:

                             (ii)  the asset’s cost to the new asset holder;

then the consequences in subsection (6) occur.

(6)  The consequences are as follows:

                     (a)  while the asset is held by the new asset holder, for the purpose of working out deductions for the asset’s decline in value under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the acquisition by the new asset holder is taken to have been for an amount equal to the asset’s roll‑over adjustable value; and

                     (b)  if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset and:

                              (i)  the deductions for its decline in value up to that time worked out on the basis in paragraph (a);

                            are less than:

                             (ii)  the deductions that would otherwise have been worked out;

                            then the shortfall is allowable as a deduction to the new asset holder for the income year in which it ceases to hold the asset.

Reduced depreciation deductions etc. for later acquirer

(7)  If:

                     (a)  the asset is acquired by another entity (a **_new asset holder_**) from an entity that is a new asset holder under subsection (3) or (5) or a previous application of this subsection; and

                     (b)  an entity:

                              (i)  was a party to the acquisition and, at the time of the acquisition, controlled (for value shifting purposes) the other party; or

                             (ii)  was not a party to each acquisition but, at the time of the acquisition, controlled (for value shifting purposes) the parties to the acquisition; and

                     (c)  that entity was also the entity whose control (for value shifting purposes) resulted in the control test being satisfied in respect of each previous acquisition or cessation involving a new asset holder; and

                     (d)  the following amount:

                              (i)  the asset’s adjustable value (the **_roll‑over adjustable value_**) just before the acquisition, worked out on the assumption that every previous new asset holder had acquired the asset for the asset’s roll‑over adjustable value, worked out under subsection (3) or (5) or this subsection, just before it did so;

                            is less than:

                             (ii)  the asset’s cost to the new asset holder;

then the consequences in subsection (8) occur.

(8)  The consequences are as follows:

                     (a)  while the asset is held by the new asset holder, for the purpose of working out deductions for the asset’s decline in value under Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the acquisition by the new asset holder is taken to have been for an amount equal to the asset’s roll‑over adjustable value asset just before the acquisition; and

                     (b)  if a balancing adjustment event occurs for the asset and:

                              (i)  the deductions for its decline in value up to that time worked out on the basis in paragraph (a);

                            are less than:

                             (ii)  the deductions that would otherwise have been worked out;

                            then the shortfall is allowable as a deduction to the new asset holder for the income year in which it ceases to hold the asset.

### Division 701B—Modified application of provisions of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 relating to CGT event L1

**Table of sections**

701B‑1      Modified application of CGT Consolidation provisions to allow immediate availability of capital loss for CGT event L1

##### <a id="701B‑1"></a>701B‑1  Modified application of CGT Consolidation provisions to allow immediate availability of capital loss for CGT event L1

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  CGT event L1 happens; and

                     (b)  members of the consolidated group or the MEC group mentioned in subsection 104‑500(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ held all of the membership interests in the entity mentioned in that subsection from the end of 30 June 2002 until the entity became a subsidiary member of the group; and

                     (c)  before the end of the fourth income year of the head company of the group ending after the entity became a subsidiary member of the group, the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member; and

                     (d)  all of the assets, other than those excepted under subsection (2), that the head company held when the entity became a subsidiary member, because the entity was taken by subsection 701‑1(1) (the single entity principle) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be a part of the head company, continued to be held by the head company until the entity ceased to be a subsidiary member.

Excepted assets

             (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), excepted assets are assets that:

                     (a)  the head company disposed of in the ordinary course of a business that the head company carried on by virtue of the entity being taken by subsection 701‑1(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be a part of the head company; and

                     (b)  were minor assets, having regard to the nature and size of that business.

Immediate availability of capital loss or net capital loss

             (3)  If this section applies, neither subsection 104‑500(4) nor subsection 104‑500(5) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies in relation to the head company for the income year in which the entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of any later income year.

701C‑1      Overview

##### <a id="701C‑1"></a>701C‑1  Overview

                   This Division:

                     (a)  sets out, for the purposes of item 2, column 4 of the table in subsection 703‑15(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, rules that allow certain entities to be subsidiary members of consolidatable groups or consolidated groups where other entities are interposed between them and the head company of the group (see Subdivision 701C‑B); and

                     (b)  modifies certain rules in Part 3‑90 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ relating to setting the tax cost of assets to take account of those membership rules (see Subdivision 701C‑C).

Note:          This Division has effect in relation to a MEC group in the same way in which it has effect in relation to a consolidated group (see sections 719‑2 and 719‑10 of this Act).

#### Subdivision 701C‑B—Membership rules allowing foreign holding

**Table of sections**

701C‑10    Additional membership rules where entities are interposed between the head company and a subsidiary member—case where an interposed entity is a foreign resident and the subsidiary member is a company

             (1)  This section describes, for the purposes of item 2, column 4 of the table in subsection 703‑15(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, a set of requirements that must be met for an entity (the **_test entity_**) to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or a consolidatable group at a particular time (the **_test time_**).

Note:          This subsection applies in relation to a MEC group as if the reference to item 2, column 4 of the table in subsection 703‑15(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ were a reference to subparagraph 719‑10(1)(b)(ii) of that Act (see subsection 719‑2(3) of this Act).

Test entity must be company

             (2)  At the test time, the test entity must be a company.

At least one interposed entity must be a non‑resident company or non‑resident trust

             (3)  At the test time, at least one of the interposed entities must be:

                     (a)  a company (a **_non‑resident company_**) that is a foreign resident; or

                     (b)  a trust (a **_non‑resident trust_**) that does not meet the requirements in any item of the table in section 703‑25 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

The interposed entities must all be of a particular kind

                     (e)  a partnership, each of the partners in which is a non‑resident company or a non‑resident trust.

Test entity must be a subsidiary member on assumption that non‑resident companies and non‑resident trusts were subsidiary members

             (5)  At the test time, it must be the case that the test entity would be a subsidiary member of the group if each interposed entity that is a non‑resident company or non‑resident trust were a subsidiary member of the group.

Additional requirement for consolidatable groups

             (6)  If the group is a consolidatable group, the test time must be before 1 July 2004.

Additional requirement for consolidated groups at formation

             (7)  If the group is a consolidated group and the test time is the time at which the group comes into existence as a consolidated group, the test time must be before 1 July 2004.

Additional requirement for consolidated groups after formation

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  the group is a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the test time is after the group comes into existence; and

                     (c)  at the test time, one or more of the membership interests in the test entity are held by:

                              (i)  a non‑resident company; or

                             (ii)  a non‑resident trust; or

                            (iii)  an entity that holds the membership interests only as a nominee of one or more entities each of which is a non‑resident company or a non‑resident trust; or

                            (iv)  a partnership, each of the partners in which is a non‑resident company or a non‑resident trust;

then:

                     (d)  from the time the group came into existence as a consolidated group until the test time, the test entity must have been a subsidiary member of the group; and

                     (e)  at the time the group came into existence as a consolidated group, one or more of the membership interests in the test entity must have been held by an entity of a kind mentioned in subparagraph (c)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv).

##### <a id="701C‑15"></a>701C‑15  Additional membership rules where entities are interposed between the head company and a subsidiary member—case where an interposed entity is a foreign resident and the subsidiary member is a trust or partnership

             (1)  This section describes, for the purposes of item 2, column 4 of the table in subsection 703‑15(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, a set of requirements that must be met for an entity (the **_test entity_**) to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or a consolidatable group at a particular time (the **_test time_**).

Note:          This subsection applies in relation to a MEC group as if the reference to item 2, column 4 of the table in subsection 703‑15(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ were a reference to subparagraph 719‑10(1)(b)(iii) of that Act (see subsection 719‑2(3) of this Act).

Test entity must be a trust or partnership

             (2)  At the test time, the test entity must be a trust or partnership.

At least one interposed entity must be a company that is a subsidiary member because of section 701C‑10

             (3)  At the test time, one or more of the interposed entities must be companies that are subsidiary members of the group because the set of requirements in section 701C‑10 are met.

Test entity must be a subsidiary member on assumption that head company beneficially owned all membership interests beneficially owned by subsection (3) companies

             (4)  At the test time, it must be the case that the test entity would be a subsidiary member of the group if the head company beneficially owned all the membership interests beneficially owned by each company described in subsection (3).

##### <a id="701C‑20"></a>701C‑20  Transitional foreign‑held subsidiaries and transitional foreign‑held indirect subsidiaries

                   If:

                     (a)  an entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group in a case where the set of requirements described in section 701C‑10 are met; and

                     (b)  one or more of the membership interests in the entity are held by:

                              (i)  a non‑resident company; or

                             (ii)  a non‑resident trust; or

                            (iii)  an entity that holds the membership interests only as a nominee of one or more entities each of which is a non‑resident company or a non‑resident trust; or

                            (iv)  a partnership, each of the partners in which is a non‑resident company or a non‑resident trust;

then:

                     (c)  the entity is a **_transitional foreign‑held subsidiary_** of the group; and

                     (d)  if:

                              (i)  the transitional foreign‑held subsidiary; or

                             (ii)  an entity that is a transitional foreign‑held indirect subsidiary of the group because of another application of this paragraph;

                            holds one or more membership interests in another entity that:

                            (iii)  is a subsidiary member of the group; and

                            (iv)  is not a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary of the group;

                            that other member is a **_transitional foreign‑held indirect subsidiary_** of the group.

Note:       In order to be a subsidiary member of the group as required by subparagraph (d)(iii), the transitional foreign‑held indirect subsidiary would need to have satisfied the set of requirements in either section 701C‑10 or 701C‑15

#### Subdivision 701C‑C—Modifications of tax cost setting rules

**Table of sections**

Application and object

701C‑25    Application and object of this Subdivision

Basic modification

701C‑30    Transitional foreign‑held subsidiary to be treated as part of head company

Other modifications

701C‑35    Trading stock value not set for assets of transitional foreign‑held subsidiaries

701C‑40    Cost setting rules for exit cases—modification of core rules

701C‑50    Cost setting rules for exit cases—reference to modification of core rule

#### Application and object

##### <a id="701C‑25"></a>701C‑25  Application and object of this Subdivision

Application

             (1)  This Subdivision applies if an entity (the **_transitional foreign‑held joining entity_**) that is a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary or a transitional foreign‑held indirect subsidiary becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the time (the **_formation time_**) the group comes into existence.

Object

             (2)  The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, on becoming a subsidiary member at the formation time, the tax cost of the assets of any transitional foreign‑held subsidiary is not set and that the tax cost setting amount for assets of any transitional foreign‑held indirect subsidiary that becomes a subsidiary member at that time takes account of this.

#### Basic modification

##### <a id="701C‑30"></a>701C‑30  Transitional foreign‑held subsidiary to be treated as part of head company

                   The following provisions:

                     (a)  section 701‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(about setting the tax cost of assets that an entity brings into the group);

                     (b)  Subdivision 705‑A of that Act, in its application in accordance with Subdivision 705‑B of that Act;

apply, for the purposes of setting the tax cost of an asset of the transitional foreign‑held joining entity at the formation time, as if each subsidiary member of the group that is a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary at the formation time were a part of the head company of the group, rather than a separate entity.

Note 1:       This section means that references in those provisions to matters internal to the group operate as if transitional foreign‑held subsidiaries in the group were parts of the head company of the group. For example:

(a)    provisions operating if the head company holds (whether directly or indirectly) membership interests in another entity operate even if a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary actually holds those interests; and

(b)    provisions operating if the head company owns or controls another entity operate even if one or more transitional foreign‑held subsidiaries actually own or control that other entity; and

(c)    provisions operating if an entity is interposed between the head company and another entity operate even if the first entity is actually interposed between a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary and the other entity.

Note 2:       If the transitional foreign‑held joining entity is a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary, this section means the assets of the entity do not have their tax cost reset at the formation time. This is because Subdivision 705‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, in its application in accordance with Subdivision 705‑B of that Act, resets the tax cost of assets of _subsidiary_ members of a group, but not assets of the head company.

#### Other modifications

##### <a id="701C‑35"></a>701C‑35  Trading stock value not set for assets of transitional foreign‑held subsidiaries

                   Subsection 701‑35(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_(setting value of trading stock at tax‑neutral amount) does not apply to the assets of the transitional foreign‑held joining entity if it is a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary.

##### <a id="701C‑40"></a>701C‑40  Cost setting rules for exit cases—modification of core rules

                   Section 701‑15 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if the following subsection were added at the end of the section:

Application to transitional foreign‑held subsidiaries

             (4)  If an entity that ceases to be a subsidiary member is a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary when it does so:

                     (a)  this section applies to each membership interest in the transitional foreign‑held subsidiary that is held by an entity (an **_eligible non‑resident_**) of a kind mentioned in subparagraph 701C‑20(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ in the same way as it applies to a membership interest in the transitional foreign‑held subsidiary that is held by the head company; and

                     (b)  for that purpose, the definition of **_head company core purposes_** in subsection 701‑1(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies to the eligible non‑resident in the same way as it applies to the head company.

##### <a id="701C‑50"></a>701C‑50  Cost setting rules for exit cases—reference to modification of core rule

                   Section 711‑5 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if the following note were added at the end of the section:

Note:          If the leaving entity is a transitional foreign‑held subsidiary (within the meaning of section 701C‑20 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997)_, this Division will, in accordance with subsection 701‑15(4) of this Act (see section 701C‑40 of the first‑mentioned Act), apply to membership interests that an eligible non‑resident mentioned in that subsection holds in the entity in the same way as it applies to membership interests that the head company holds in the entity.

### Division 701D—Transitional foreign loss makers

**Table of Subdivisions**

701D‑A Object of this Division

701D‑B Membership rules allowing transitional foreign loss makers to remain outside consolidated group

#### Subdivision 701D‑A—Object of this Division

**Table of sections**

701D‑1     Object of this Division

##### <a id="701D‑1"></a>701D‑1  Object of this Division

             (1)  The object of this Division is to allow an entity that is a potential subsidiary member of a consolidated group to utilise an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) during a transitional period, rather than have the head company utilise the loss subject to the restrictions in Subdivision 707‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (2)  Therefore, this Division allows the head company to prevent the entity from being a subsidiary member of the group, for a transitional period.

#### Subdivision 701D‑B—Rules allowing transitional foreign loss makers to remain outside consolidated group

**Table of sections**

701D‑10   Transitional foreign loss maker not member of group if certain conditions satisfied

701D‑15   Choice to apply transitional rules to entity

##### <a id="701D‑10"></a>701D‑10  Transitional foreign loss maker not member of group if certain conditions satisfied

             (1)  The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ and this Act  have effect as if an entity (the **_transitional foreign loss maker_**) is not a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at a particular time (the **_transitional time_**) if:

                     (a)  the group came into existence at a particular time (the **_formation time_**) before  1 July 2004; and

                     (b)  apart from this section, the transitional foreign loss maker would be a subsidiary member of the group at the transitional time; and

                     (c)  the transitional time is not later than 3 years after the formation time; and

                     (d)  the head company of the group has made a choice under section 701D‑15 to apply this section to the transitional foreign loss maker; and

                     (e)  the continuous ownership condition in subsection (2) is satisfied; and

                      (f)  the foreign loss condition in subsection (3) is satisfied; and

                     (g)  the no‑subsidiary condition in subsection (4) is satisfied.

Continuous ownership condition

             (2)  The continuous ownership condition is satisfied if the transitional foreign loss maker was a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the entity that became the head company of the group throughout the period:

                     (a)  beginning at the start of 1 July 2002; and

                     (b)  ending at the transitional time.

Foreign loss condition

             (3)  The foreign loss condition is satisfied if:

                     (a)  the transitional foreign loss maker incurred an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) in respect of the 2001‑02 income year or an earlier income year; and

                     (b)  the amount of the overall foreign loss has not been fully taken into account under one or more applications of former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ to the transitional foreign loss maker in relation to an income year or income years ending before the transitional time; and

                     (c)  assuming that the transitional foreign loss maker had become a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at the formation time, as a result all or part of the overall foreign loss would have been transferred at that time to the head company of the group under Division 707 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

No‑subsidiary condition

             (4)  The no‑subsidiary condition is satisfied if, at the transitional time:

                     (a)  the transitional foreign loss maker does not hold any membership interests in any other entity; or

                     (b)  both of the following conditions are satisfied:

                              (i)  the transitional foreign loss maker holds one or more membership interests in one or more other entities;

                             (ii)  assuming that the head company of the group (rather than the transitional foreign loss maker) held that interest or those interests, none of those other entities would be a subsidiary member of the group.

Transitional foreign loss maker stays in consolidatable group

             (5)  To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not prevent the transitional foreign loss maker from being a member of a consolidatable group at the transitional time for the purposes of:

                     (a)  subsection 126‑50(6) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  paragraphs 170‑5(2A)(b) and 170‑105(2A)(b) of that Act; and

                     (c)  subparagraph 820‑599(1)(b)(iii) of that Act.

##### <a id="701D‑15"></a>701D‑15  Choice to apply transitional rules to entity

             (1)  The head company of a consolidated group may make a choice in the approved form to apply section 701D‑10 to another entity.

             (2)  However, the head company cannot make that choice if subsection 701D‑10(1) previously prevented the entity from being a subsidiary member of a consolidated group.

             (3)  The choice must be made by the later of:

                     (a)  the day on which the head company must give the notice under section 703‑58 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (notice of choice to consolidate); and

                     (b)  30 days after the _Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 1) 2004_ received the Royal Assent.

             (4)  The choice cannot be revoked.

### Division 702—Modified application of this Act to assets that an entity brings into a consolidated group

##### <a id="702‑1"></a>702‑1  Modified application of section 40‑77 of this Act to assets that an entity brings into a consolidated group

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  an entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  just before it does so, section 40‑77 of this Act applies to an asset that it holds.

             (2)  For so long as the asset continues to be:

                     (a)  an asset of the head company because subsection 701‑1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies; or

                     (b)  an asset of another entity, where it became such an asset as a result of that subsection ceasing to apply on the entity ceasing to be a subsidiary member of the group;

then, despite certain provisions of that Act applying, in accordance with subsection 701‑55(2) of that Act, as if the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount:

                     (c)  subsection 40‑77(1) continues to apply to the asset; and

Note:       This means that Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ continues not to apply to an asset that is a mining, quarrying or prospecting right.

                     (d)  subsection 40‑77(2) continues to apply to the asset, but applies as if the reference in that subsection to the cost of the asset were a reference to the cost worked out on the basis that the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount; and

                     (e)  subsection 40‑77(3) continues to apply to the asset, but applies as if the reference in that subsection to the amount included in assessable income under subsection 40‑285(1) of that Act were a reference to the amount so worked out on the basis that the asset were acquired for a payment equal to its tax cost setting amount.

##### <a id="702‑4"></a>702‑4  Extended operation of subsection 40‑285(3)

             (1)  This section applies in relation to a balancing adjustment event that occurs:

                     (a)  for a depreciating asset held by an entity (the **_final entity_**); and

                     (b)  after the asset became an asset of the head company of a consolidated group because of section 701‑1 (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applying when an entity became a subsidiary member of the group.

It does not matter whether or not the final entity is the same as the head company or the entity mentioned in paragraph (b).

Note:          The final entity will be different from the head company if an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) took the asset with it when leaving the group, whether or not the leaving entity brought the asset into another consolidated group before the asset came to be held by the final entity.

             (2)  The final entity is entitled to a further deduction under subsection 40‑285(3) of this Act for the balancing adjustment event if the final entity would have been entitled to the deduction apart from paragraph 701‑55(2)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ operating at any time before the event occurred.

Note:          The final entity will be entitled to the deduction apart from paragraph 701‑55(2)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ only if the entity is treated as having depreciated the asset under former Division 42 of that Act, because of section 701‑5 (the entry history rule) of that Act and perhaps also section 701‑40 (the exit history rule) of that Act.

             (3)  However, the final entity is not entitled to the deduction if, at a time before the balancing adjustment event occurred:

                     (a)  the asset became the asset of the head company of a consolidated group because of section 701‑1 (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applying when an entity (the **_joining entity_**) became a subsidiary member of the group; and

                     (b)  the tax cost setting amount for the asset was more than the joining entity’s terminating value for the asset.

It does not matter whether or not the change in status of the asset described in paragraph (a) of this subsection is the same change as the change in status of the asset described in paragraph (1)(b).

Note:          In some cases, section 705‑47 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ reduces the tax cost setting amount for a depreciating asset to the joining entity’s terminating value for the asset, so that subsection (3) of this section will not prevent the final entity from getting the further deduction under subsection 40‑285(3) of this Act.

##### <a id="702‑5"></a>702‑5  Modified application of subsection 40‑285(6) of this Act after entity brings assets into consolidated group

                   If:

                     (a)  an entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  because subsection 701‑1(1) (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies, an asset of the entity becomes an asset of the head company of the group; and

                     (c)  a balancing adjustment event happens in relation to the asset while it is an asset of the head company;

subsection 40‑285(6) of this Act (about reducing the amount included in assessable income for a balancing adjustment event) applies as if the cost of the asset were equal to the tax cost setting amount applicable in relation to the asset for the purposes of having its tax cost set by section 701‑10 (cost to head company of assets that entity brings into group) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          The tax cost setting amount applicable in relation to the asset for that purpose is worked out in accordance with Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

### Division 703—Consolidated groups and their members

703‑35      Employee share schemes

##### <a id="703‑30"></a>703‑30  Debt interests that are not membership interests

             (1)  For the purposes of Part 3‑90 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, this section affects whether an interest or right that is held by an entity on or after 1 July 2002 and relates to another entity is a membership interest of the entity in the other entity.

             (2)  Apply Division 974 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ in determining under Subdivision 960‑G of that Act whether the interest or right is a membership interest of the entity in the other entity.

Note:          Under Subdivision 960‑G of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, a debt interest relating to an entity is not a membership interest in the entity. Division 974 of that Act explains what a debt interest is.

             (3)  This section has effect whether or not the debt and equity test amendments (as defined in item 118 of Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Act 2001_) apply to transactions in relation to the interest or right at the relevant time.

##### <a id="703‑35"></a>703‑35  Employee share schemes

                   Despite the amendments of section 703‑35 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ made by Schedule 1 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Budget Measures No. 2) Act 2009_, subsection (4) of that section continues to apply, from the commencement of that Schedule, to each share and membership interest that it applied to just before that commencement.

705‑310    Adjustable value of head company’s notional assets

##### <a id="705‑300"></a>705‑300  Application and object of this Subdivision

             (1)  If an entity (the **_joining entity_**) to which section 40‑75 of this Act applied becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**), this Subdivision applies in relation to:

                     (a)  depreciating assets that:

                              (i)  caused section 40‑75 of this Act to apply to the joining entity; and

                             (ii)  became assets of the head company of the group at the joining time because of section 701‑1 (Single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ operating in relation to the joining entity; and

                     (b)  notional assets that sections 40‑35, 40‑37, 40‑40 and 40‑43 of this Act treat an entity as holding because of expenditure relating to such depreciating assets;

to affect the operation of Division 40, section 701‑55 and Division 705 of that Act.

             (2)  The main object of this Subdivision is to ensure that entities are allowed only an appropriate amount of deductions in connection with such depreciating assets and such expenditure.

##### <a id="705‑305"></a>705‑305  Rules affecting depreciating assets

             (1)  The main object of this section is to ensure that a depreciating asset’s tax cost is set, and other matters relevant to working out the deductions of the head company of the consolidated group for the decline in value of the asset are dealt with, so as to:

                     (a)  ensure that the head company does not get excessive deductions on account of expenditure (by any entity) relating to the asset; and

                     (b)  reflect the deductions of an entity for a period ending before the joining time for expenditure relating to the asset; and

                     (c)  ensure that the effective life of the asset for the head company reflects the rate or rates at which the joining entity was able to deduct expenditure relating to the asset (whether or not the expenditure formed part of the cost of the asset).

Prime cost method of working out decline in value of asset

             (2)  If the joining entity could not deduct an amount under Subdivision 40‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for the income year that includes the joining time for the decline in value of a depreciating asset, subsection 701‑55(2) of that Act has effect as if the prime cost method for working out the decline in value of the asset applied just before the joining time.

Note:          This may affect both the method of working out the decline in value of the asset and the asset’s effective life.

Adjustable value of asset

             (3)  Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if the adjustable value of a depreciating asset just before and at the joining time were increased by the amount described in subsection (4), if section 40‑35, 40‑37, 40‑40 or 40‑43 treated the joining entity as holding a notional asset.

Note:          This affects not only the adjustable value of the depreciating asset but also the joining entity’s terminating value for the asset (which section 705‑30 of that Act defines as being equal to the asset’s adjustable value just before the joining time).

             (4)  The amount of the increase is so much of the adjustable value of the notional asset just before the joining time as reasonably relates to the depreciating asset.

Cost of asset

             (5)  Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if the cost of a depreciating asset were increased by expenditure incurred that did not form part of the asset’s cost worked out under Division 40 of that Act but would have if it had been incurred just before the joining time under a contract entered into after 30 June 2001.

Earlier deductions for decline in value of asset

             (6)  Division 705 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if deductions relating to expenditure described in subsection (5) were deductions for the decline in value of the depreciating asset.

Example:    Such deductions include:

(a)    deductions under former Subdivision 330‑A, 330‑C or 330‑H of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, or a corresponding previous law, for the expenditure; and

(b)    deductions under Division 40 of that Act for the decline in value of a notional asset that section 40‑35, 40‑37, 40‑40 or 40‑43 of this Act treated an entity as holding because of the expenditure.

Effective life of asset

             (7)  If a depreciating asset’s tax cost setting amount does not exceed the joining entity’s terminating value for the asset, Division 40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if the effective life of the asset were such period as is reasonable, having regard to the following:

                     (a)  the remainder of the effective life of the asset, worked out just before the joining time;

                     (b)  the remainder of the effective life, worked out just before the joining time, of each notional asset (which section 40‑35, 40‑37, 40‑40 or 40‑43 of this Act treats an entity as holding wholly or partly because of expenditure relating to the depreciating asset);

                     (c)  any other relevant matters.

Subsection 701‑55(2) of that Act has effect subject to this subsection.

Note 1:       The effective life of the depreciating asset was set on 1 July 2001 by subsection 40‑75(4) of this Act, but may have been reset since under Subdivision 40‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note 2:       The effective life of a notional asset is specified by whichever one of sections 40‑35, 40‑37, 40‑40 and 40‑43 of this Act is relevant to the notional asset.

Choosing to reduce tax cost setting amount of asset

             (8)  If:

                     (a)  a depreciating asset’s tax cost setting amount would be greater than the joining entity’s terminating value for the asset; and

                     (b)  the head company of the consolidated group chooses to apply this subsection to the asset;

the asset’s tax cost setting amount is reduced so that it equals the terminating value.

Note 1:       A consequence of the choice is that subsection (7) applies to the asset.

Note 2:       The amount of the reduction is not re‑allocated among other assets.

             (9)  Section 705‑55 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ has effect as if subsection (8) of this section were included in section 705‑45 of that Act.

Note:          This affects the order of reductions in the asset’s tax cost setting amount under subsection (8) of this section and section 705‑40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

##### <a id="705‑310"></a>705‑310  Adjustable value of head company’s notional assets

Application

             (1)  If:

                     (a)  section 40‑35, 40‑37, 40‑40 or 40‑43 of this Act treats the head company of the consolidated group as holding a notional asset at the joining time because expenditure is taken under section 701‑5 (Entry history rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to be expenditure of the head company; and

                     (b)  section 40‑35, 40‑37, 40‑40 or 40‑43 of this Act treated the joining entity as holding a notional asset just before the joining time because of the expenditure;

this section affects the adjustable value of the head company’s notional asset.

Object

             (2)  The object of this section is to ensure, by reducing the adjustable value of a notional asset of the head company, that the head company cannot get both:

                     (a)  a deduction for the notional asset reflecting the amount of the expenditure relating to depreciating assets; and

                     (b)  a deduction for that amount because of the decline in value of those depreciating assets.

Reduction at joining time for expenditure on depreciating assets

             (3)  The opening adjustable value of the head company’s notional asset for the income year that includes the joining time is so much of the adjustable value of the joining entity’s notional asset just before the joining time as does not reasonably relate to any depreciating asset.

Note:          This offsets the increases in adjustable value of the head company’s depreciating assets under subsection 705‑305(3).

                     (a)  the revocation of the choice mentioned in that subsection takes place before 1 January 2006; and

                     (b)  each entity in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied has agreed to the revocation:

                              (i)  the entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceased to be a subsidiary member of the group before the revocation took place;

                             (ii)  an asset became that of the leaving entity because section 701‑1 (the single entity rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ ceased to apply when the leaving entity ceased to be a subsidiary member;

                            (iii)  the asset had become that of the head company because that section applied when the joining entity to which Subdivision 707‑A of that Act applies (whether or not the same entity as the leaving entity) became a subsidiary member.

Conditions for increasing real loss‑maker’s modified market value

             (1)  This section affects the working out of the available fraction for a bundle of losses under subsection 707‑320(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if:

                     (a)  the transferee mentioned in that subsection chooses under subsection (5) of this section to work out the available fraction using a percentage of the modified market value of a company (the **_value donor_**) other than the real loss‑maker mentioned in subsection 707‑315(1) of that Act for the bundle; and

                     (b)  both the real loss‑maker and the value donor became members of the group mentioned in subsection 707‑315(1) of that Act in connection with the bundle at the time (which is the initial transfer time mentioned in that subsection in connection with the bundle) the group became a consolidated group; and

                     (c)  the initial transfer time is before 1 July 2004; and

                    (ca)  neither the real loss‑maker nor the value donor has been, at any time before the initial transfer time, a transitional foreign loss maker prevented by subsection 701D‑10(1) from being a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

                     (d)  the bundle includes a loss that is _not_:

                              (i)  an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  a loss whose utilisation is affected by section 707‑350 (about utilisation of certain losses originally made for an income year ending on or before 21 September 1999); and

                     (e)  the value donor would have been able to transfer the loss to the transferee under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ at the initial transfer time had the value donor:

                              (i)  made the loss for the income year for which the real loss‑maker made it; and

                             (ii)  not utilised it; and

                    (ea)  neither of these sections applies in relation to the value donor as joining entity at the time the group became a consolidated group:

                              (i)  section 713‑535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance company);

                             (ii)  section 713‑540 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are segregated exempt assets of life insurance company); and

                      (f)  the requirement in subsection (2) is met.

             (2)  It must have been possible for the real loss‑maker to have transferred the loss to the value donor under Subdivision 170‑A or 170‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for an income year consisting of the period described in section 707‑328 had the conditions in that section existed.

Adding to the modified market value of the real loss‑maker

             (3)  Work out the available fraction for the bundle of losses as if there were added to the modified market value of the real loss‑maker at the initial transfer time the amount worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00662/Html/5916c2a7-00b5-44ae-a4dc-b084225da50a_files/image030.gif)

Note:          The amount worked out using the formula will be nil if the value donor’s modified market value at the initial transfer time is nil. Even if the amount is nil, section 707‑327 may treat losses transferred by the value donor to the transferee as if they were included in the bundle of losses transferred by the real loss‑maker to the transferee.

             (4)  In subsection (3):

                    <a name="total-real-loss-maker-division-170-loss-bundl"></a>**_total of real loss‑maker’s Division 170 losses in bundle_** is the total of the amount of each loss:

                     (a)  that is covered by paragraphs (1)(d) and (e); and

                     (b)  in relation to which the requirements in subsection (2) are met.

                    <a name="total-real-loss-maker-non-foreign-loss-bundl"></a>**_total of real loss‑maker’s non‑foreign losses in bundle_** is the total of the amount of each loss that is described in paragraph (1)(d).

Choice to work out available fraction using this section

             (5)  The transferee may choose to use a fixed percentage (greater than 0% and not more than 100%) of the value donor’s modified market value to work out the available fraction for the bundle. The transferee may do so only by the later of:

                     (a)  the day on which it lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it utilises (except in accordance with section 707‑350) losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  the end of 31 December 2005.

Note:          For the purposes of paragraph (5)(a), ignore losses to which section 713‑535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies. See section 707‑355 of this Act.

             (6)  The choice cannot be amended, or revoked, after 31 December 2005.

If this section applies more than once for the same value donor

             (7)  If subsection (3) applies 2 or more times in relation to the same value donor but different real loss‑makers, the transferee cannot choose for those applications percentages of the value donor’s modified market value at the initial transfer time that result in the total of the amounts worked out under those applications exceeding that value.

Increase in real loss‑maker’s value reduces value donor’s value

             (8)  Work out the available fraction for a bundle of losses transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _from the value donor_ at the initial transfer time as if the value donor’s modified market value at the time were reduced by the amount worked out under subsection (3).

This section does not affect utilisation of overall foreign losses

             (9)  This section has effect for working out the available fraction of a bundle of losses only so far as it affects the utilisation of a tax loss, film loss or net capital loss. It does not affect the utilisation of an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) included in a bundle of losses:

                     (a)  transferred from the real loss‑maker under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                     (b)  transferred from the value donor under that Subdivision.

Note:          If a bundle of losses includes an overall foreign loss and a loss of another sort:

(a)    utilisation of the overall foreign loss is limited by the available fraction for the bundle worked out apart from this section; and

(b)    utilisation of the loss of the other sort is limited by the available fraction for the bundle as affected by this section, if applicable.

##### <a id="707‑326"></a>707‑326  Events involving only value donor and real loss‑maker not covered by rule against inflation of modified market value

             (1)  This section affects the calculation of the modified market value of the real loss‑maker mentioned in subsection 707‑315(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for a bundle of losses. This section affects the calculation:

                     (a)  only if section 707‑325 of this Act applies for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle; and

                     (b)  only for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle to affect the utilisation of tax losses, film losses and net capital losses in the bundle (and not any overall foreign losses, as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, in the bundle).

Note:          This section does not affect the calculation of the real loss‑maker’s modified market value for other purposes (such as the real loss‑maker being a value donor for the purposes of another application of section 707‑325 of this Act).

             (2)  Disregard for the purposes of subsection 707‑325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ an event:

                     (a)  that is described in subsection 707‑325(4) of that Act; and

                     (b)  that meets the condition in subsection (3) or (4) of this section.

             (3)  One condition is that the event was an injection of capital directly into the real loss‑maker by the value donor mentioned in section 707‑325 of this Act.

             (4)  The other condition is that the event was a transaction:

                     (a)  that did not take place at arm’s length; and

                     (b)  that involved only the real loss‑maker and the value donor mentioned in section 707‑325 of this Act; and

                     (c)  that would have caused subsection 707‑325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ to operate in working out the real loss‑maker’s modified market value (even if no other events described in subsection 707‑325(4) of that Act had occurred), apart from this section.

             (5)  Subsection (2) of this section does not apply if subsection 707‑325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_:

                     (a)  operates for the purposes of working out the value donor’s modified market value because of an event that involved an entity other than the value donor and the real loss‑maker (whether or not the event also involved either the value donor or the real loss‑maker); or

                     (b)  would operate for those purposes because of such an event apart from another application of this section.

##### <a id="707‑327"></a>707‑327  Choosing available fraction to apply to value donor’s loss

Conditions for choosing available fraction for value donor’s loss

             (1)  This section has effect for the purposes of working out under Subdivision 707‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ how much of a tax loss, film loss or net capital loss can be utilised if:

                     (a)  the available fraction for a bundle of other losses is worked out, because of section 707‑325, as if there were added to the modified market value of the real loss‑maker of the other losses an amount worked out under that section by reference to the value donor’s modified market value; and

                     (b)  the loss was transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of that Act at the initial transfer time _from the value donor_; and

                     (c)  the loss is _not_ a loss whose utilisation is affected by section 707‑350 (about utilisation of certain losses originally made for an income year ending on or before 21 September 1999); and

                     (d)  each company covered by subsection (2) would have been able to transfer the loss under Subdivision 707‑A of that Act at the initial transfer time had the company:

                              (i)  made the loss for the income year for which the value donor made it; and

                             (ii)  not utilised it; and

                     (e)  the requirement in subsection (3) is met.

Note:          This section has effect even if the amount added to the real loss‑maker’s modified market value under section 707‑325 is nil because the value donor’s modified market value is nil.

             (2)  This subsection covers:

                     (a)  the real loss‑maker; and

                     (b)  each other company (if any) for which it is the case that the available fraction for the bundle is worked out, because of another application of section 707‑325, as if there were added to the real loss‑maker’s modified market value an amount worked out by reference to the company.

             (3)  It must have been possible for the value donor to have transferred an amount (greater than a nil amount) of the loss to each company covered by subsection (2) under Subdivision 170‑A or 170‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ for an income year consisting of the period described in section 707‑328 had the conditions in that section existed.

Treating value donor’s loss as included in bundle

             (4)  If the transferee mentioned in subsection 707‑325(1) chooses, sections 707‑310, 707‑335 (except paragraph 707‑335(2)(a)) and 707‑340 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (and subsections 707‑315(3) and (4) of that Act, so far as they relate to those sections) operate as if, at the initial transfer time:

                     (a)  the bundle of losses included the loss; and

                     (b)  the loss was not included in any other bundle of losses.

Note:          This section has the effect that the utilisation of the loss will be affected by the available fraction for the bundle of losses.

Choice to treat value donor’s loss as included in bundle

             (5)  A choice for the purposes of subsection (4):

                     (a)  may be made only by the later of:

                              (i)  the day on which the transferee lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it utilises (except in accordance with section 707‑350) losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                             (ii)  the end of 31 December 2005; and

                     (b)  cannot be revoked after 31 December 2005.

Note:          For the purposes of subparagraph (5)(a)(i), ignore losses to which section 713‑535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies. See section 707‑355 of this Act.

Loss already in bundle with increased available fraction

             (6)  Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to the loss if it was covered by paragraphs 707‑325(1)(d) and (e) and subsection 707‑325(2) in an application of section 707‑325 separate from the application of that section mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) of this section.

Note:          This means that a loss that provided a basis for section 707‑325 to apply in relation to the working out of the available fraction for a bundle of losses cannot be treated under this section as if it were included in another bundle of losses.

##### <a id="707‑328"></a>707‑328  Income year and conditions for possible transfer under Division 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_

             (1)  This section sets out the period and conditions referred to:

                     (a)  in subsections 707‑325(2) and 707‑327(3); and

                     (b)  in connection with the requirement that it must have been possible for a company (the **_notional transferor_**) to transfer to another company (the **_notional transferee_**) for an income year a loss under Subdivision 170‑A or 170‑B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Period to be treated as income year for transfer

             (2)  The period:

                     (a)  starts at the _later_ of these times:

                              (i)  the start of the trial year;

                             (ii)  the start of the income year for which the loss was made; and

                     (b)  ends immediately after the initial transfer time mentioned in subsection 707‑320(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          For the purposes of identifying the trial year using the definition in section 707‑120 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the notional transferor mentioned in this section is the same as the joining entity mentioned in that section, and the initial transfer time mentioned in this section is the same as the joining time mentioned in that section.

Conditions

             (3)  The first condition is that neither the notional transferor nor the notional transferee became a subsidiary member of a consolidated group before, at or after the initial transfer time mentioned in the relevant subsection.

             (4)  The second condition is that neither of those Subdivisions had been amended to provide only for transfers involving an Australian branch (as defined in section 160ZZV of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) of a foreign bank.

             (5)  The third condition is that the notional transferee’s income or gains for the income year were great enough not to prevent the transfer.

             (6)  The fourth condition is that those Subdivisions operated as if the notional transferor had made the loss for the income year if the notional transferor had actually made it for an income year ending just before the initial transfer time.

##### <a id="707‑328A"></a>707‑328A  Some events involving only group members not covered by rule against inflation of modified market value

Overview

             (1)  Subsection (3) of this section affects the calculation, under section 707‑325 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ and section 707‑325 of this Act, of the modified market value of the real loss‑maker mentioned in subsection 707‑315(1) of that Act for a bundle of losses, but only if:

                     (a)  the requirement in subsection (2) of this section is met in relation to each other company that became a member of the group mentioned in subsection 707‑315(1) of that Act in connection with the bundle at the time (the **_formation time_**) the group became a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the provisions described in subsection 707‑327(4) of this Act operate (because of that subsection) in relation to each loss of such a company that is covered by paragraphs 707‑327(1)(b) and (c) of this Act as if the bundle included the loss; and

                     (c)  all members of the group at the formation time were companies; and

                     (d)  subsection 707‑325(2) of that Act does not operate, for the purposes of working out the modified market value of an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time, because of an event that involved an entity that did not become a member of the group then; and

                     (e)  the transferee mentioned in subsection 707‑325(1) of this Act chooses that this section apply in relation to the real loss‑maker.

             (2)  Section 707‑325 of this Act must apply in relation to the other company (as value donor) so that the available fraction for the bundle is to be worked out as if there were added to the real loss‑maker’s modified market value an amount worked out by reference to the other company’s modified market value at the initial transfer time.

Disregarding events for purposes of anti‑inflation rule

             (3)  Disregard for the purposes of subsection 707‑325(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ an event that is described in subsection 707‑325(4) of that Act and was either:

                     (a)  an injection of capital into an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time by another such entity; or

                     (b)  a transaction that involved only entities that became members of the group at the formation time.

Note:          Disregarding such an event could have a direct or indirect effect on the real loss‑maker’s modified market value for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle in one of these ways:

(a)    it could directly affect the real loss‑maker’s modified market value calculated under section 707‑325 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, if the real loss‑maker was involved in the event;

(b)    it could have an indirect effect by affecting the value donor’s modified market value calculated under that section and used under section 707‑325 of this Act to add an amount to the real loss‑maker’s modified market value for those purposes.

Choice

             (4)  A choice for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e):

                     (a)  may be made only by the later of:

                              (i)  the day on which the transferee lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it utilises (except in accordance with section 707‑350) losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                             (ii)  the end of 31 December 2005; and

                     (b)  cannot be amended, or revoked, after 31 December 2005.

Note:          For the purposes of subparagraph (4)(a)(i), ignore losses to which section 713‑535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies. See section 707‑355 of this Act.

Scope of this section

             (5)  This section affects the modified market value of an entity that became a member of the group at the formation time only for the purposes of calculating the real loss‑maker’s modified market value for the purposes of working out the available fraction for the bundle.

             (6)  This section has effect for working out the available fraction of the bundle only so far as it affects the utilisation of a tax loss, film loss or net capital loss. It does not affect the utilisation of an overall foreign loss (as defined in former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_) that:

                     (a)  is included in the bundle; or

                     (b)  was transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ from an entity other than the real loss‑maker.

Note:          If the bundle includes an overall foreign loss and a loss of another sort:

(a)    utilisation of the overall foreign loss is limited by the available fraction for the bundle worked out apart from this section; and

(b)    utilisation of the loss of the other sort is limited by the available fraction for the bundle as affected by this section, if applicable.

             (7)  This section can operate in relation to only one bundle of losses transferred to the transferee under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

##### <a id="707‑329"></a>707‑329  Modified market value at a time before 8 December 2004

                   Disregard an event that is described in subsection 707‑325(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ and occurred on or before 8 December 2000 in working out under section 707‑325 of that Act the modified market value of an entity at the time it becomes a member of a consolidated group on a day before 8 December 2004.

##### <a id="707‑350"></a>707‑350  Alternative loss utilisation regime to Subdivision 707‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_

             (1)  This section affects the way in which one or more losses of one particular sort in a bundle of losses transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ before 1 July 2004 can be utilised by the transferee if:

                     (a)  they were actually made (disregarding that Subdivision) by a company (the **_real loss‑maker_**) for an income year ending on or before 21 September 1999; and

                     (b)  they were transferred at the time (the **_initial transfer time_**) the transferee became the head company of a consolidated group; and

                     (c)  they were transferred to the transferee from the real loss‑maker because:

                              (i)  the real loss‑maker met the conditions in section 165‑12 of that Act; and

                             (ii)  the conditions in one or more of paragraphs 165‑15(1)(a), (b) and (c) did not exist in relation to the real loss‑maker; and

                     (d)  none of them had been transferred under that Subdivision before the initial transfer time; and

                   (da)  the real loss‑maker has not been, at any time before the initial transfer time, a transitional foreign loss maker prevented by subsection 701D‑10(1) from being a subsidiary member of a consolidated group; and

                     (e)  the transferee has made a choice under subsection (5).

Losses to be utilised only after non‑transferred losses

             (2)  The transferee may utilise for an income year the losses only _after_ utilising for the year losses (the **_non‑transferred losses_**) of the same sort that the transferee made without a transfer under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (even if the income year for which the transferee made the losses is earlier than an income year for which the transferee made any of the non‑transferred losses).

Further limit on utilising the losses

             (3)  The amount of the losses that the transferee may utilise for an income year _cannot exceed_ the amount worked out for the year using the table.

Subdivision 707‑C of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 disapplied

             (4)  Subdivision 707‑C of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ operates as if the losses had been made by the transferee _without_ being transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of that Act.

Note:          This has 2 effects. First, Subdivision 707‑C of that Act does not limit utilisation of the losses. Secondly, it affects the limit that Subdivision sets on utilising other losses in any bundle (because that limit depends on the transferee’s income and gains remaining after utilisation of losses that have not been transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of that Act).

Making choice

             (5)  The transferee may choose that this section apply to the utilisation for any income year of all losses (of any sort) in the bundle that meet the conditions in paragraphs (1)(a), (b), (c) and (d). The transferee may do so only by the later of:

                     (a)  the day on which it lodges its income tax return for the first income year for which it could utilise any losses transferred to it under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (as described in subsection (1) or otherwise); and

                     (b)  the end of 31 December 2005.

Note:          For the purposes of paragraph (5)(a), ignore losses to which section 713‑535 (Losses of entities whose membership interests are virtual PST assets of life insurance companies) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies. See section 707‑355 of this Act.

When choice has effect

             (6)  The choice has effect for that income year and all later income years (and cannot be revoked after 31 December 2005).

Future transfer of the losses not affected

             (7)  This section does not limit the transfer under Subdivision 707‑A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ of any of the losses from the transferee to another company.

##### <a id="707‑355"></a>707‑355  Ignore certain losses in working out when a choice can be made under this Subdivision

                   In working out when a choice may be made under subsection 707‑325(5), 707‑327(5), 707‑328A(4) or 707‑350(5), ignore losses to which section 713‑535 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies.

Note:          That section deals with losses transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of that Act from certain wholly‑owned subsidiaries of life insurance companies that are members of a consolidated group.

##### <a id="712‑305"></a>712‑305  Reducing adjustable value of head company’s notional asset

             (1)  This section reduces the adjustable value of a notional asset that section 40‑35, 40‑37, 40‑38, 40‑40 or 40‑43 treats the head company of a consolidated group as holding, if:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group at a time (the **_leaving time_**); and

                     (b)  that section treats the leaving entity as holding a notional asset because of section 701‑40 (Exit history rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note:          Section 701‑40 (Exit history rule) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ treats as expenditure of the leaving entity certain expenditure incurred before the leaving time in relation to an asset or business that was an asset or business of the leaving entity at the leaving time.

             (2)  The adjustable value of the head company’s notional asset is reduced at the leaving time by the adjustable value of the leaving entity’s notional asset at that time.

##### <a id="713‑500"></a>713‑500  Object of Subdivision

                   The object of this Subdivision is to give an opportunity to a group of entities that includes a life insurance company to rearrange the assets of the group for the purposes of one or more of them becoming members of a consolidated group in a way that does not attract any immediate taxation consequences.

##### <a id="713‑505"></a>713‑505  When this Subdivision applies (first case)

             (1)  This Subdivision provides for a deferral of the taxation consequences that would occur because of an event (the **_deferral event_**) happening involving an entity (the **_originating entity_**) and another entity (the **_recipient entity_**) if:

                     (a)  the event occurs in connection with a life insurance company (the **_member life insurance company_**) becoming a member of a consolidated group; and

                     (b)  the relevant conditions in section 713‑520 are met.

             (2)  If the originating entity is a company, the deferral event referred to in subsection (1) is a CGT event referred to in subsection (4) happening to a CGT asset (the **_original asset_**) where, apart from this Subdivision, the happening of the event would have resulted in:

                     (a)  an amount (other than a capital gain) being included in the originating entity’s assessable income; or

                     (b)  the originating entity making a capital gain.

             (3)  If the originating entity is a trust, the deferral event referred to in subsection (1) is a CGT event referred to in subsection (4) happening to a CGT asset (also the **_original asset_**) where, apart from this Subdivision, the happening of the event would have resulted in:

                     (a)  an amount (other than a capital gain) being included in the net income of the trust; or

                     (b)  the trustee making a capital gain.

             (4)  The CGT events are:

                     (a)  CGT events A1, B1, D1, D2, D3, E2, F1 and F2; and

                     (b)  CGT event C2, but only if the CGT asset that ends is a unit in a unit trust that is replaced by an equivalent membership interest (the **_replacement interest_**) in a company or in another trust.

##### <a id="713‑510"></a>713‑510  When this Subdivision applies (second case)

             (1)  This Subdivision also provides for a deferral of the taxation consequences that would occur if:

                     (a)  a life insurance company transfers an asset (also the **_original asset_**) to its virtual PST or from its virtual PST where, apart from this Subdivision, section 320‑200 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ would apply to the transfer; or

where the transfer (also the **_deferral event_**) is made in connection with the life insurance company (also the **_member life insurance company_**) becoming a member of a consolidated group.

             (2)  The relevant conditions in section 713‑520 must be met.

##### <a id="713‑515"></a>713‑515  Entities must choose the relief

             (2)  The choice must be made:

                     (a)  by the day the originating entity or the life insurance company, or the head company of the consolidated group of which it is a member, lodges its income tax return for the income year in which the deferral event happened; or

                     (b)  within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

##### <a id="713‑520"></a>713‑520  Conditions

             (1)  For a section 713‑505 case:

                     (a)  the originating entity must be:

                              (i)  a life insurance company that has virtual PST assets or segregated exempt assets and that is a member of a consolidatable group; or

                             (ii)  an entity that is unable to be a member of the same consolidatable group as a life insurance company because of section 713‑510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                            (iii)  an entity that is, directly or indirectly, a subsidiary of a life insurance company and is a member of the same consolidated group as the life insurance company; and

                     (b)  the originating entity and the recipient entity must be members of the same consolidatable group or consolidated group or, if they are not, they would have been apart from section 713‑510 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (c)  any asset transferred by the originating entity must be transferred to the recipient entity at its transfer value.

             (2)  For both a section 713‑505 case and a section 713‑510 case:

                     (a)  the total transfer values of the virtual PST assets of the member life insurance company just before a transfer of assets to which this Subdivision applies must be the same as the total transfer values of those assets just after the transfer; and

                     (b)  the total transfer values of the segregated exempt assets of the member life insurance company just before a transfer of assets to which this Subdivision applies must be the same as the total transfer values of those assets just after the transfer.

             (3)  Any transfer of an asset under the deferral event must happen on or before the later of:

                     (a)  30 June 2004; and

                     (b)  if the head company of the consolidated group of which the member life insurance company is a member has a substituted accounting period—the end of the head company’s income year in which 30 June 2004 occurs.

##### <a id="713‑525"></a>713‑525  Time of transfer

                   This Act, and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, apply to the transfer of an asset to which this Subdivision applies as if the asset had been transferred just before the member life insurance company became a member of the consolidated group.

##### <a id="713‑530"></a>713‑530  What the relief is

             (1)  For a section 713‑505 case:

                     (a)  if the originating entity is a company:

                              (i)  any amount (other than a capital gain) that would have been included in the originating entity’s assessable income (the **_deferred amount_**) as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                             (ii)  any capital gain (the **_deferred gain_**) that the originating entity would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded; and

                     (b)  if the originating entity is a trust:

                              (i)  any amount (other than a capital gain) that would have been included in the member life insurance company’s assessable income (also the **_deferred amount_**) as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                             (ii)  any capital gain (also the **_deferred gain_**) that the member life insurance company would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded.

             (2)  For a section 713‑510 case:

                     (a)  any amount that would have been included in the member life insurance company’s assessable income (also the **_deferred amount_**) under paragraph 320‑15(e) or (g) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as a result of the deferral event is not so included; and

                     (b)  any capital gain (also the **_deferred gain_**) that the member life insurance company would have made as a result of the deferral event is disregarded.

##### <a id="713‑535"></a>713‑535  Subsequent consequences

             (1)  This section operates if, after the deferral event happens, another event (the **_new event_**) happens where the new event is:

                     (a)  a CGT event happening to:

                              (i)  the original asset; or

                             (ii)  if the deferral event was CGT event C2—the replacement asset; or

                     (b)  the recipient entity ceasing to be a member of the consolidated group of which the member life insurance company is a member; or

                     (c)  if the recipient entity is a life insurance company:

                              (i)  the original asset being transferred to or from the company’s virtual PST under section 320‑180, 320‑185 or 320‑195 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; or

                             (ii)  the original asset being transferred to or from the company’s segregated exempt assets under section 320‑235, 320‑240 or 320‑250 of that Act; or

                     (d)  if the originating entity is a company—the originating entity ceasing to exist.

             (2)  For a section 713‑505 case where the originating entity is a company:

                     (a)  the originating entity must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the originating entity is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

Note:          If the originating entity is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group, the head company of the group will have the amount included in its assessable income or will make the capital gain.

             (3)  For a section 713‑505 case where the originating entity is a trust:

                     (a)  the member life insurance company must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the member life insurance company is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

             (4)  For a section 713‑505 case where the originating entity is a life insurance company or a trust and the deferred amount or the deferred gain relates to an asset that was a virtual PST asset at the time when the deferral event happened, an amount equal to the deferred amount or deferred gain is taken to be an amount of assessable income to which subsection 320‑205(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies for the relevant entity.

             (5)  For a section 713‑510 case:

                     (a)  the member life insurance company must include the deferred amount in its assessable income for the income year in which the new event happens; or

                     (b)  the member life insurance company is taken, just before the new event happened, to have made a capital gain equal to the deferred gain.

             (6)  In addition, if the deferral event involved the transfer of assets from the member life insurance company’s virtual PST, an amount equal to the deferred amount or deferred gain is taken to be an amount of assessable income to which subsection 320‑205(3) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies for the relevant entity.

##### <a id="713‑540"></a>713‑540  Requirement to notify happening of new event

             (1)  For a section 713‑505 case, the recipient entity must, if it is not a member of the same consolidated group as the originating entity when the new event happens, notify the originating entity in the approved form of the happening of the new event within 60 days after the new event happens.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if the new event is the originating entity ceasing to exist.

##### <a id="713‑545"></a>713‑545  Discount capital gain in certain cases

                   The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies as if the capital gain referred to in paragraph 713‑535(2)(b), (3)(b) or (5)(b) were a discount capital gain if:

                     (a)  the asset to which the deferral event happened is a virtual PST asset; and

                     (b)  the asset was acquired less than 12 months before the deferral event happened; and

                     (c)  the new event happens at least 12 months after the asset was acquired.

                     (b)  but for the cessation of membership and section 701‑40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the exit history rule), the head company of the group would be subject to a balancing adjustment under item 104 of Schedule 1 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act 2009_ for an income year ending after the leaving time.

             (2)  Despite section 701‑40 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the exit history rule), the head company of the consolidated group continues to be subject to the balancing adjustment  for income years ending after the leaving time.

##### <a id="727‑1"></a>727‑1  Application of Division 727

             (1)  Division 727, as inserted by the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_ and amended by the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation and Other Measures) Act 2003_, applies to a scheme entered into on or after 1 July 2002.

             (2)  It also applies to a scheme entered into on or after 27 June 2002, but only in relation to:

                     (a)  an indirect value shift that happens under the scheme on or after 1 July 2002; or

                     (b)  a presumed indirect value shift that happens under the scheme and affects a realisation event that happens on or after 1 July 2002.

             (3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to an indirect value shift, or a presumed indirect value shift, if:

                     (a)  the economic benefits taken into account in determining that the scheme has resulted in that indirect value shift or presumed indirect value shift include economic benefits provided by:

                              (i)  an act referred to in Division 138 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as the trigger event; or

                             (ii)  an event or act referred to in Division 139 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as the trigger event; and

                     (b)  the act was done, or the event happened, on or after 27 June 2002 and before 1 July 2002.

Note:          In that case, the consequences of the trigger event are worked out under Division 138 or 139 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_: see items 13 and 14 of Schedule 15 to the _New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002_.

##### <a id="727‑230"></a>727‑230  Transitional exclusion for certain indirect value shifts relating mainly to services

             (1)  An indirect value shift does not have consequences under Division 727 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ if, to the extent of at least 95% of their total market value, the greater benefits consist entirely of:

                     (a)  a right to have services that are covered by section 727‑240 of that Act provided directly by the losing entity to the gaining entity; or

                     (b)  services that are covered by that section and have been, are being, or are to be, so provided;

or both, and the IVS time for the scheme that results in the indirect value shift is before:

                     (c)  unless paragraph (d) applies—the start of the losing entity’s 2003‑2004 income year; or

                     (d)  if the losing entity’s 2002‑2003 income year ends before 30 June 2003—the start of the losing entity’s 2004‑2005 income year.

How subsection (1) applies to a presumed indirect value shift

             (2)  For the purposes of section 727‑850 (about a presumed indirect value shift affecting a realisation event) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, subsection (1) of this section applies to the presumed indirect value shift:

                     (a)  on the assumptions set out in subsection 727‑865(3) of that Act; and

                     (b)  as if the exclusion in subsection (1) of this section were an exclusion in Subdivision 727‑C of that Act.

##### <a id="727‑470"></a>727‑470  Affected interests do not include equity or loan interests owned by entity that is eligible to be an STS taxpayer

             (1)  This section applies to an indirect value shift if:

                     (a)  the indirect value shift happens in the 2007‑08 income year or a later income year; and

                     (b)  the scheme that results in the indirect value shift was entered into before the start of the 2007‑08 income year.

             (2)  Paragraph 727‑470(2)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (as in force immediately before the commencement of this section) continues to have effect in relation to the indirect value shift as if the repeals and amendments made by Schedule 1, Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3 and Schedule 8 to the _Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Act 2007_ had not been made.

#### Converting an overall foreign loss into a type of tax loss

##### <a id="770‑1"></a>770‑1  Converting a past foreign loss into a tax loss

             (1)  Subject to subsection (4), the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(the **_1936 Act_**), the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_1997 Act_**) and this Act operate for the purposes of the income years mentioned in subsection (3) as if an entity that has a convertible foreign loss for an earlier income year under section 770‑5 had a tax loss for the earlier year equal to:

                     (a)  the amount (if any) that would have been the entity’s tax loss for the earlier year under section 36‑10, 165‑70, 175‑35 or 701‑30 of the 1997 Act (about deducting past tax losses); _plus_

                     (b)  the amount of the entity’s convertible foreign loss for the earlier year.

Note 1:       This is instead of an amount of tax loss worked out under section 36‑10, 165‑70, 175‑35 or 701‑30 of the 1997 Act.

Note 2:       This section does not affect the amount (if any) of an entity’s taxable income for the year. An entity may be taken to have a tax loss for a year under this section, but also have a taxable income for the year.

Note 3:       This section has an expanded operation for consolidated groups: see section 770‑90.

             (2)  The earlier year is taken for those purposes to be a loss year  for the entity if the entity would not otherwise have a tax loss for that year.

             (3)  The income years are:

                     (a)  the first income year starting on or after the first 1 July that occurs after the day on which the _Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Act 2007_ receives the Royal Assent (the **_commencement year_**); and

                     (b)  later income years.

             (4)  A reference in section 90 of the 1936 Act to deductions allowable under Division 36 of the 1997 Act does not include a reference to deductions in respect of the foreign loss component of the tax loss.

Note:          For **_foreign loss component_**, see section 770‑25.

##### <a id="770‑5"></a>770‑5  Convertible foreign loss

             (1)  An entity has a loss to which this section applies (a **_convertible foreign loss_**) for an earlier income year covered by subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  the entity has incurred an overall foreign loss in respect of a class of assessable foreign income (within the meaning of former section 160AFD of the 1936 Act) for the earlier income year; and

                     (b)  a positive amount (an **_unutilised overall foreign loss amount_**) remains after reducing the overall foreign loss to the extent that it has been taken into account under that former section in reducing the entity’s assessable foreign income of the relevant class for an income year before the commencement year; and

                     (c)  a positive amount (a **_reduced unutilised overall foreign loss amount_**) remains after reducing the unutilised overall foreign loss amount under section 770‑10.

Note 1:       For the classes of income, see former subsection 160AFD(8) of the 1936 Act.

Note 2:       There is a modification to this rule for losses transferred to a head company of a consolidated group: see subsection 770‑80(2).

Note 3:       Former section 160AFD of the 1936 Act allowed a past foreign loss to reduce assessable foreign income of the same class.

             (2)  The income year must be one of the most recent 10 income years ending before the commencement year.

             (3)  The amount of the convertible foreign loss for the earlier year is the sum of the reduced unutilised overall foreign loss amounts for all classes of assessable foreign income for the earlier year.

##### <a id="770‑10"></a>770‑10  Reducing an unutilised overall foreign loss amount

                   Apply the following method statement to each unutilised overall foreign loss amount in relation to a class of assessable foreign income of an earlier income year.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1\. If the entity is a company and the relevant class of assessable foreign income is the “all other assessable income” class—reduce the unutilised overall foreign loss amount to the extent (if any) that the relevant overall foreign loss is attributable to losses or outgoings incurred in gaining or producing income of a kind that would be the company’s non‑assessable non‑exempt income if it were gained or produced in the commencement year.

              Otherwise—do not reduce the unutilised overall foreign loss amount under this step.

Step 2\. For income years other than the most recent 7 income years ending before the commencement year—reduce the result of step 1 by half.

                   Note:             Step 2 is modified for losses transferred to a head company of a consolidated group: see subsection 770‑80(3).

* * *

#### Utilising transitional foreign losses

##### <a id="770‑15"></a>770‑15  No special rules if convertible foreign losses total less than or equal to $10,000 or choice made

                   Section 770‑30 does not apply in relation to a tax loss an entity is taken by section 770‑1 to have if:

                     (a)  the amount worked out under section 770‑20 (the **_starting total_**) is less than or equal to $10,000; or

                     (b)  the entity chooses to reduce one or more tax losses the entity is taken by section 770‑1 to have had so that the starting total equals $10,000.

##### <a id="770‑20"></a>770‑20  Starting total for loss parcel

                   The sum of the convertible foreign losses for each earlier year for which an entity is taken by section 770‑1 to have a tax loss is the starting total for all of those tax losses taken together (the **_loss parcel_**).

Example:    On 1 July 2008, Loss Co determines that it has incurred the following overall foreign losses:

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>Year ended 30 June 2002: $5,000 (with no amount of convertible foreign loss due to the operation of 770‑10);

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>Year ended 30 June 2004: $4,000 (with an amount of $2,000 being a convertible foreign loss);

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>Year ended 30 June 2005: $7,000 (with an amount of $3,000 being a convertible foreign loss);

·<span style="font:7.0pt " new="">      </span>Year ended 30 June 2007: $8,000 (with the entire amount being a convertible foreign loss).

                   Loss Co does not have any other domestic tax losses for those income years (that is, the 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2007 income years are not loss years).

                   Initially, Loss Co’s starting total for the loss parcel is $13,000, which consists of the tax losses incurred in the year ended 30 June 2004, the year ended 30 June 2005 and the year ended 30 June 2007 (there is no convertible foreign loss incurred in the year ended 30 June 2002 because of section 770‑1 and therefore there is no tax loss included in the loss parcel for that year). The 2004, 2005 and 2007 income years will then be a new loss year for Loss Co (under subsection 770‑1(2)), because Loss Co did not otherwise incur a tax loss in those years.

                   To avoid the operation of the deduction limit (under section 770‑30), Loss Co chooses under paragraph 770‑15(b) to reduce the starting total for the loss parcel to $10,000 by not converting $3,000 of its convertible foreign losses (which consists of $2,000 of the 2004 tax loss and $1,000 of the 2005 tax loss). Consequently, only the 2005 and 2007 income years are the new loss years for Loss Co.

##### <a id="770‑25"></a>770‑25  Tax loss has foreign loss component

                   A tax loss an entity is taken to have under section 770‑1 has a separate component (the **_foreign loss component_**). The amount of the component is the amount of the convertible foreign loss.

##### <a id="770‑30"></a>770‑30  Deduction limit for foreign loss component

             (1)  The amount of the foreign loss component of one or more tax losses in a loss parcel that an entity can deduct in an income year _cannot exceed_ the amount worked out for the year using the table.

Note:          There may be a reduction of the limit for the head company of a consolidated group under section 770‑100.

             (2)  This section does not limit the amount of the foreign loss component of a tax loss that an entity can deduct in a year later than the third income year ending after the commencement year.

Note:          For later years, any remaining undeducted tax loss may be deducted to the extent permitted by the general rules for tax losses.

             (3)  To avoid doubt, if, because of subsection (1) or section 770‑100, an entity cannot deduct all or part of a tax loss in an income year, subsection 36‑17(7) of the 1997 Act does not prevent the entity deducting other tax losses in the same year in accordance with that subsection.

##### <a id="770‑35"></a>770‑35  Offset limit to take account of deducted foreign loss component

             (1)  This section affects the calculation of your offset limit for an income year under section 770‑75 of the 1997 Act.

             (2)  This section applies for an income year if you have deducted an amount of the foreign loss component of one or more tax losses (see section 770‑25) in the income year.

             (3)  In working out the amount referred to in subparagraph 770‑75(2)(b)(ii) of the 1997 Act for the year, you must assume (in addition to the assumptions set out in subsection 770‑75(4) of that Act), that you were not entitled to any deductions covered by subsection (2).

770‑105    Modified operation of Subdivision 707‑C of the 1997 Act for foreign loss component

770‑110    Application of Subdivision to MEC groups

##### <a id="770‑80"></a>770‑80  Transferred losses taken not to be refreshed for purposes of converting overall foreign loss

             (1)  This section applies if:

                     (a)  a loss is transferred under section 707‑120 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_1997 Act_**) from a joining entity to a head company; and

                     (b)  the loss is an overall foreign loss in respect of a class of assessable foreign income (within the meaning of former section 160AFD of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(the **_1936 Act_**)).

Note:          Former section 160AFD of the 1936 Act allowed a past foreign loss to reduce assessable foreign income of the same class.

             (2)  In applying section 770‑5, only have regard to the overall foreign loss if the income year in which it was actually incurred (disregarding subsection 707‑140(1) of the 1997 Act) was one of the most recent 10 income years ending before the commencement year.

Note:          Section 770‑5 is about the amount of an entity’s convertible foreign losses. Section 707‑140 deems the head company of a group to have made a transferred loss in the year in which it is transferred.

             (3)  A reduction must be made under step 2 of the method statement in section 770‑10 if the overall foreign loss was actually incurred (disregarding subsection 707‑140(1) of that Act) in an income year other than the most recent 7 income years ending before the commencement year.

Note:          Section 770‑10 is about reducing an entity’s past foreign losses to arrive at the entity’s convertible foreign loss for past years.

##### <a id="770‑85"></a>770‑85  Deduction limit not to restrict transfer of losses

                   Section 770‑30 (deduction limit for foreign loss component) does not limit the transfer, under Subdivision 707‑A of the 1997 Act, of a tax loss that has a foreign loss component.

##### <a id="770‑90"></a>770‑90  Transfer of losses not restricted where part of trial year occurs before commencement year

                   Section 770‑1 operates in relation to a trial year in the same way it operates in relation to the income years mentioned in subsection 770‑1(3) if:

                     (a)  a tax loss has a foreign loss component; and

                     (b)  it is necessary to determine whether an entity could utilise the tax loss for an income year consisting of the trial year; and

                     (c)  part of the trial year occurs before the start of the commencement year mentioned in subsection 770‑1(3).

##### <a id="770‑95"></a>770‑95  Foreign loss component and starting total retained after transfer to head company

                   Where a tax loss having a foreign loss component is transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of the 1997 Act to a head company:

                     (a)  the tax loss has the same amount of foreign loss component after the transfer as it had immediately before the transfer; and

                     (b)  the starting total for the loss parcel to which the tax loss belongs (see section 770‑20) is the same after the transfer as it was immediately before the transfer.

Note:          This section ensures a tax loss retains its foreign loss component and starting total even though the head company is taken, after the transfer, to have made the loss for the income year in which the transfer occurs.

##### <a id="770‑100"></a>770‑100  Limit where foreign loss component utilised by joining entity

             (1)  This section applies where one or more tax losses having a foreign loss component are transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of the 1997 Act to the head company of a consolidated group.

             (2)  The limit under subsection 770‑30(1) of the amount of the foreign loss component of the tax losses that the transferee can deduct for an income year mentioned in an item in the table in that subsection is reduced by the amount (if any) worked out under subsection (3).

             (3)  The amount of the reduction is the sum of each amount of the foreign loss component that has been deducted by any entity in respect of a non‑membership period mentioned in section 701‑30 of the 1997 Act, or income year, ending before the latest time (the **_latest transfer time_**) the loss was transferred to the head company.

Note:          Section 701‑30 of the 1997 Act sets out how an entity that is not a subsidiary member of a consolidated group for all of an income year calculates its tax liability or tax loss for the periods (called non‑membership periods) when it is not a member of a group.

             (4)  In applying paragraph (b) of item 2, 3 or 4 of the table in subsection 770‑30(1) of this Act, disregard any amount deducted, in respect of a tax loss mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, before the latest transfer time.

##### <a id="770‑105"></a>770‑105  Modified operation of Subdivision 707‑C of the 1997 Act for foreign loss component

             (1)  This section affects the way in which one or more tax losses in a bundle of losses transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of the 1997 Act can be utilised by the transferee in an income year if:

                     (a)  one or more of the tax losses has a foreign loss component (regardless whether at the time of transfer the bundle included a tax loss having a foreign loss component or an overall foreign loss in respect of a class of income (within the meaning of former section 160AFD of the 1936 Act)); and

                     (b)  section 770‑30 limits the amount of the foreign loss component that the transferee can deduct in the income year.

             (2)  Subdivision 707‑C of the 1997 Act does not limit the utilisation of the foreign loss component for the income year.

Note:          This means that the available fraction does not apply to the foreign loss component of a tax loss in the first 4 years after commencement. Instead, the deduction limit in section 770‑30 applies.

             (3)  For the purposes of working out under Subdivision 707‑C of the 1997 Act how much of the tax losses in the bundle the transferee can utilise in the income year, section 707‑310 of the 1997 Act has effect as if the first reference in paragraph (3)(b) of that section to the transferee’s losses included a reference to the sum of the amounts of the foreign loss components for all loss parcels in the income year.

Note:          This affects the limit that Subdivision 707‑C of that Act sets on utilising other tax losses in the bundle (because that limit depends on the transferee’s income and gains remaining after utilisation of losses that have not been transferred under Subdivision 707‑A of that Act): see subsection 707‑310(3) of that Act.

##### <a id="770‑110"></a>770‑110  Application of Subdivision to MEC groups

                   This Subdivision has effect in relation to a MEC group in the same way in which it has effect in relation to a consolidated group.

#### Subdivision 770‑C—Transitional foreign losses (special rules for CFCs)

**Table of sections**

770‑160    Converting a past CFC loss

770‑165    Convertible CFC loss

770‑170    Reducing an unutilised CFC loss amount

##### <a id="770‑160"></a>770‑160  Converting a past CFC loss

             (1)  The _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (the **_1936 Act_**) operates for the purposes of the statutory accounting periods mentioned in subsection (2) as if an eligible CFC (within the meaning of Division 7 of Part X of that Act) (an **_eligible CFC_**) that has a convertible CFC loss for an earlier statutory accounting period under section 770‑165 has a loss for the earlier period equal to the amount of the convertible CFC loss.

Note:          Part X of the 1936 Act deals with the attribution of the income of a CFC to attributable taxpayers.

             (2)  The statutory accounting periods are:

                     (a)  the first statutory accounting period starting on or after the first 1 July that occurs after the day on which the _Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Act 2007_ receives the Royal Assent (the **_commencement period_**); and

                     (b)  later statutory accounting periods.

##### <a id="770‑165"></a>770‑165  Convertible CFC loss

             (1)  An eligible CFC has a loss to which this section applies (a **_convertible CFC loss_**) for an earlier statutory accounting period covered by subsection (2) if:

                     (a)  the eligible CFC has a loss under section 426 of the 1936 Act for the earlier period in relation to notional assessable income of a class; and

                     (b)  a positive amount (an **_unutilised CFC loss amount_**) remains after reducing the loss to the extent that it has been previously taken into account under section 431 of the 1936 Act in respect of a statutory accounting period before the commencement period; and

                     (c)  a positive amount (a **_reduced unutilised CFC loss amount_**) remains after reducing the unutilised CFC loss amount under section 770‑170.

Note:          For the classes of notional assessable income, see former subsection 424(1) of the 1936 Act.

             (2)  The statutory accounting period must be one of the most recent 10 statutory accounting periods ending before the commencement period.

             (3)  The amount of the convertible CFC loss for the earlier period is the sum of the reduced unutilised CFC loss amounts in relation to notional assessable income of all classes for the earlier period.

##### <a id="770‑170"></a>770‑170  Reducing an unutilised CFC loss amount

                   Apply the following method statement to each unutilised CFC loss amount in relation to notional assessable income of a class for the earlier statutory accounting period.

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1.   Reduce the unutilised CFC loss amount to the extent (if any) that the relevant loss relates to the “all other amounts” class of notional assessable income, except to the extent (if any) that the loss is attributable to losses or outgoings incurred in gaining or producing income of a kind that would be the company’s notional assessable income or sometimes‑exempt income.

Step 2.   For statutory accounting periods other than the most recent 7 statutory accounting periods ending before the commencement period—reduce the result of step 1 by half.

770‑225    Pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax generated for a company by excess foreign tax credits relating to other income

770‑230    Increase in the foreign income tax offset

##### <a id="770‑220"></a>770‑220  Converting excess foreign tax credits into pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax

             (1)  You have pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax from an income year if:

                     (a)  you have excess foreign tax credits in relation to a class of foreign income from an earlier income year under former section 160AFE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(the **_1936 Act_**); and

                     (b)  the earlier income year is one of the most recent 5 income years ending before the first income year starting on or after the first 1 July that occurs after the day on which the _Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Act 2007_ receives the Royal Assent; and

                     (c)  the credits have not already been applied under former section 160AFE of the 1936 Act.

Note:          For the classes of income, see former subsections 160AF(7) and 160AFE(5) of the 1936 Act.

                   Former section 160AFE of the 1936 Act determined whether an entity had excess foreign tax credits for an income year and whether it could use them to increase the foreign tax credit amount in a later income year. Under the former foreign tax credit system, the excess credits were worked out and, where applicable, applied to increase the foreign tax credit amount in relation to each of the classes of income listed in former subsection 160AF(7).

             (2)  The amount of your pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax from an income year is the sum of the amounts set out in the table in subsection (3) for that year.

             (3)  Column 2 of the following table specifies the class of income to which the excess foreign tax credits covered by subsection (1) relate. Column 3 sets the amount of pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax from that income year generated by those excess foreign tax credits.

##### <a id="770‑225"></a>770‑225  Pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax generated for a company by excess foreign tax credits relating to other income

                   Reduce the amount of the excess foreign tax credits to the extent (if any) that they are attributable to foreign tax paid in respect of amounts that would be your non‑assessable non‑exempt income if they were derived in the commencement year.

##### <a id="770‑230"></a>770‑230  Increase in the foreign income tax offset

             (1)  This section affects the amount of your tax offset under section 770‑70 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_1997 Act_**).

Note:          That section determines how much tax offset you can claim for foreign income tax you have paid.

             (2)  Your tax offset for an income year (the **_current year_**) is increased in accordance with this section if:

                     (a)  the amount of your tax offset worked out under section 770‑70 of the 1997 Act falls short of your offset limit under section 770‑75 of that Act; and

                     (b)  you have pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax (see section 770‑220) from an earlier year of income that is one of the most recent 5 income years ending before the current year.

             (3)  Increase your tax offset for the current year by adding your pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax covered by paragraph (2)(b) to the amount of your tax offset worked out under section 770‑70 of the 1997 Act _._

             (4)  Only increase the offset to the extent of the shortfall worked out under paragraph (2)(a).

             (5)  You no longer have the pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax to the extent that it has been used to increase your offset.

#### Subdivision 770‑E—Transitional foreign income tax offsets (special rules for consolidated groups)

770‑285    Objects of this Subdivision

770‑290    Transferring subsidiary member’s pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax to head company

770‑295    Where entity not subsidiary member for whole of income year

770‑300    Pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax lost on joining consolidated group

770‑305    Exit history rule does not treat leaving entity as having pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax

770‑310    Application of Subdivision to MEC groups

##### <a id="770‑285"></a>770‑285  Objects of this Subdivision

                   The main objects of this Subdivision are:

                     (a)  to allow the head company of a consolidated group to apply, in relation to an income year, pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax of an entity (the **_joining entity_**) that becomes a subsidiary member of the group at a time (the **_joining time_**) if:

                              (i)  the income year starts at or after the joining time; and

                             (ii)  that pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax is from an income year ending before the joining time; and

                     (b)  to prevent the joining entity from applying pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) to increase its own tax offset under Division 770 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (the **_1997 Act_**).

##### <a id="770‑290"></a>770‑290  Transferring subsidiary member’s pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax to head company

             (1)  This section operates for the purposes of section 770‑220 in relation to an income year if:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_joining entity_**) becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group at a time (the **_joining time_**); and

                     (b)  the joining time is before or at the start of that income year; and

                     (c)  the joining entity has pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax (the **_transferred foreign income tax_**) from an earlier income year.

             (2)  For those purposes:

                     (a)  the head company of the group is taken to have the transferred foreign income tax; and

                     (b)  if, apart from paragraph (a), the head company has pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax from the earlier year—the transferred foreign income tax is taken to be included in that pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax.

             (3)  Subsection (2) also has effect for the purposes of a subsequent operation of this section.

##### <a id="770‑295"></a>770‑295  Where entity not subsidiary member for whole of income year

             (1)  This section  operates if:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_joining entity_**) is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group for some but not all of an income year (the **_joining year_**); and

                     (b)  there are one or more periods in the joining year (each of which is a **_non‑membership period_**) during which the entity is not a subsidiary member of any consolidated group.

Note:          Section 701‑30 of the 1997 Act treats each non‑membership period as a separate income year for some purposes.

             (2)  Subsection (3) has effect for the purposes of section 701‑30 of the 1997 Act in relation to the joining entity.

             (3)  In working out amounts for the joining entity under subsection 701‑30(3) of the 1997 Act in relation to each non‑membership period, assume that, if the joining year starts at the same time as the earliest of those non‑membership periods, section 770‑230 operates in relation to the joining entity for that non‑membership period.

##### <a id="770‑300"></a>770‑300  Pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax lost on joining consolidated group

             (1)  For the purposes of section 770‑220 in relation to an income year ending after the time an entity becomes a subsidiary member of a consolidated group, the entity is taken not to have any pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax from an income year, or non‑membership period described in section 701‑30 of the 1997 Act, that ended before or at that time.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of section 770‑220 in accordance with section 770‑290.

##### <a id="770‑305"></a>770‑305  Exit history rule does not treat leaving entity as having pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax

             (1)  This section operates in relation to an income year if:

                     (a)  an entity (the **_leaving entity_**) ceases to be a subsidiary member of a consolidated group before the end of that income year; and

                     (b)  the head company of the group has pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax from an earlier income year.

             (2)  To avoid doubt, the leaving entity is _not_ taken because of section 701‑40 of the 1997 Act (the exit history rule) to have that pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax.

             (3)  It does not matter whether the head company has that pre‑commencement excess foreign income tax because of section 717‑10 of the 1997 Act or 770‑290 (whether in relation to the leaving entity or another entity) or because of another provision.

##### <a id="770‑310"></a>770‑310  Application of Subdivision to MEC groups

                   This Subdivision has effect in relation to a MEC group in the same way in which it has effect in relation to a consolidated group.

                     (b)  the income year starts before 1 July 2012.

             (2)  Subdivision 284‑C in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ applies in relation to the entity and the income year as if:

          (1A)  Subdivisions 820‑FA and 820‑FB of that Act apply on and after 1 July 2002.

             (2)  Subdivision 820‑L of that Act, to the extent that it relates to the requirements under section 820‑960 of that Act, applies only in relation to an income year that begins on or after 1 July 2002.

             (2)  In this section, **_debt and equity test amendments_** has the same meaning as in Part 4 of Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Act 2001_.

##### <a id="820‑45"></a>820‑45  Transitional provision—accounting standards and prudential standards

             (1)  This section applies to 4 consecutive income years of an entity beginning on or after 1 January 2005.

             (2)  Subject to subsection (3), the entity may choose, for any or all of those income years, to use the accounting standards in force under the _Corporations Act 2001_ immediately before 1 January 2005 (rather than the current accounting standards) for the purpose of calculating amounts applicable to the entity under Division 820 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note 1:       Making the choice for an income year does not require the entity to maintain a full set of accounts based on those old accounting standards.

Note 2:       The choice is only for the purposes of calculating amounts for the purposes of the thin capitalisation regime.

             (3)  If the entity makes a choice under subsection (2) for an income year but an associate entity of that entity does not, the entity may, in working out its associate entity excess amount so far as it relates to that associate entity at a time in that year, use either the accounting standards in force under the _Corporations Act 2001_ immediately before 1 January 2005 or the current accounting standards.

             (4)  If an ADI makes a choice under subsection (2) for an income year, the ADI must also choose to use for that year the prudential standards in force under the _Banking Act 1959_ immediately before 1 January 2005 (rather than the current prudential standards) for the purpose of calculating amounts applicable to the ADI under Division 820 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

Note 1:       Making the choice for an income year does not require the entity to maintain capital adequacy calculations based on those old prudential standards.

Note 2:       The choice is only for the purposes of calculating amounts for the purposes of the thin capitalisation regime.

             (5)  For an income year for which an entity does not make a choice under subsection (2), the current accounting standards will be used for the purpose of calculating amounts applicable to the entity under Division 820 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

             (6)  For an income year for which an ADI does not make a choice under subsection (2), the current prudential standards will be used for the purpose of calculating amounts applicable to the ADI under Division 820 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_.

                              (i)  a statutory accounting period of a CFC, in relation to which the taxpayer was an attributable taxpayer at the end of that period and had an attribution percentage greater than nil, ended in the past income year; or

                             (ii)  the taxpayer had an interest in a FIF at the end of the past income year; and

                     (c)  the CFC or FIF would have been a foreign hybrid in relation to the past income year under:

                              (i)  section 830‑10 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ (disregarding paragraph (1)(e) of that section); or

                             (ii)  section 830‑15 of that Act (disregarding paragraph (1)(d) and subsection (3) of that section);

                            if that section had been in force in the past income year;

then, for the purposes mentioned in subsection (2) of this section, the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies with the modifications set out in section 830‑20 of this Act in working out:

                     (d)  the attributable income of the CFC for the statutory accounting period that ended in the past income year; or

                     (e)  the notional income of the FIF for the notional accounting period that ends in the past income year.

Purposes

             (2)  The purposes are:

                     (a)  any amendment of an assessment of the taxpayer for the past income year made before the commencement of this section; and

                     (b)  the making of an assessment of the taxpayer for the past income year between the commencement of this section and the end of 30 June 2004; and

                     (c)  any amendment of such an assessment; and

                     (d)  the making of any assessment of the taxpayer for the past income year that takes place after 30 June 2004 and before the end of the time within which, if that assessment had been made on 1 July 2004, the Commissioner could amend the assessment under paragraph 170(2)(b), (c) or (d) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(as in force before the day on which the _Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Act (No. 2) 2005_ received the Royal Assent); and

                     (e)  any amendment of such an assessment.

Exception

             (3)  If:

                     (a)  apart from this subsection, subsection (1) would apply to a taxpayer in relation to a CFC for a past income year; and

                     (b)  before the commencement of this section, the taxpayer lodged its income tax return for the past income year; and

                     (c)  the taxpayer prepared the income tax return on the basis that, for the purposes of Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, the CFC was a resident of no particular unlisted country;

then subsection (1) does not apply to the taxpayer in relation to the CFC for the past income year unless:

                     (d)  if there is only one past income year to which paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection apply—the taxpayer elects that the subsection applies for the past income year; or

                     (e)  if there is more than one past income year to which paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection apply—the taxpayer elects that the subsection applies for all of those past income years.

             (4)  The taxpayer must make the election:

                     (a)  on or before the day on which the taxpayer lodges its income tax return for the 2003‑2004 income year; or

                     (b)  within a further time allowed by the Commissioner.

             (5)  The election is irrevocable.

##### <a id="830‑20"></a>830‑20  Modifications of income tax law

             (1)  This section sets out the modifications of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ that, if section 830‑15  of this Act so provides, apply in working out for a taxpayer:

                     (a)  the attributable income of a CFC for the statutory accounting period that ended in an income year; or

                     (b)  the notional income of a FIF for the notional accounting period that ended in an income year.

CFC—residence

             (2)  If the CFC is not a resident of a particular listed country or a particular unlisted country for the purposes of Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_(including after applying section 331 of that Act), then for the purposes of that Part, the CFC is taken to be a resident of the country under whose laws it was formed.

CFC—foreign tax paid by taxpayer

             (3)  For the purpose of subsection 393(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, if the taxpayer paid foreign tax (within the meaning of that Act) (the **_actual foreign tax_**) on its interest in an amount included in the notional assessable income of the CFC for the statutory accounting period, then the CFC is taken to have paid foreign tax (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of the amount equal to the actual foreign tax divided by the taxpayer’s direct attribution interest in the CFC at the end of the statutory accounting period.

CFC—foreign tax paid by another CFC

             (4)  For the purpose of subsection 393(1) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, if:

                     (a)  on the assumption in paragraph 830‑15(1)(c) of this Act, another CFC (the **_tracing CFC_**) would have been a partner in the foreign entity that the CFC mentioned in subsection (1) of this section (the **_foreign hybrid CFC_**) would have been; and

                     (b)  the taxpayer had an attribution tracing interest in the tracing CFC that was taken into account in calculating the taxpayer’s attribution percentage for the foreign hybrid CFC at the end of the statutory accounting period; and

                     (c)  the tracing CFC paid foreign tax (within the meaning of that Act) (the **_actual foreign tax_**) on its interest in an amount included in the notional assessable income of the foreign hybrid CFC for the statutory accounting period;

then the foreign hybrid CFC is taken to have paid foreign tax, (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of the amount included in its notional assessable income, equal to the actual foreign tax divided by the tracing CFC’s direct attribution interest in the foreign hybrid CFC at the end of the statutory accounting period.

FIF—foreign tax paid by taxpayer

             (5)  For the purpose of section 573 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, if the taxpayer paid foreign tax (within the meaning of that Act) (the **_actual foreign tax_**) on its interest in an amount included in the notional income of the FIF for the notional accounting period, then the FIF is taken to have paid foreign tax (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of that amount equal to the actual foreign tax divided by the attribution percentage applicable under section 581 of that Act to the taxpayer in respect of the taxpayer’s interests in the FIF at the end of the notional accounting period.

Note:          The tax is imposed by the _Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Transitional) Act 2008_.

             (5)  The amounts are reduced by any loss or outgoing of yours to the extent that:

                     (a)  it is incurred in gaining or producing the amounts; or

                     (b)  it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the amounts.

                     (b)  if subsection 840‑805(4) of that Act would so apply to you—the end of the month in which you become presently entitled to the relevant amount.

                     (c)  the entity was a managed investment scheme as mentioned in paragraph (a) at all times from the commencement of 1 July 1998 until the registration of the scheme as mentioned in paragraph (b); and

                     (d)  the entity was the same kind of entity immediately before, and immediately after, the scheme was so registered; and

                     (e)  changes to the scheme that were necessary to be made to enable the scheme to be registered as mentioned in paragraph (b) were made during the period beginning on 1 July 1998 and ending on 30 June 2000 (the **_transition period_**); and

                      (f)  the membership of the scheme did not alter as a result of the changes; and

                     (g)  where any other changes were or are made to the scheme during the transition period:

                              (i)  the other changes were or are made only for the purpose of improving the administration or operation of the scheme; and

                             (ii)  there were no increases in the values of the interests of any members of the scheme as a result of the other changes or, if there were any such increases, they applied proportionately to the values of the interests of all the members of the scheme; and

                   Despite the changes made as mentioned in subsection 960‑105(1) to the managed investment scheme constituted by an entity to which this Subdivision applies:

                     (a)  the entity is taken, immediately after the changes were made or, if the changes were made at different times, immediately after the last of the changes was made, to be the same entity as existed immediately before the changes were made or, if the changes were made at different times, immediately before the first of the changes was made; and

                     (b)  the legal ownership of the assets of the entity is taken not to have altered as a result of the changes; and

                     (c)  the beneficial ownership of the interests in the entity of a member of the entity to whom, because of a particular change, this Subdivision applies in relation to those interests is taken not to have altered as a result of the change; and

                              (i)  the changes are taken not to have resulted in a CGT event in respect of the entity; and

                             (ii)  in so far as this Subdivision applies to a member of the entity because of a particular change, the change is taken not to have resulted in a CGT event in respect of the member in relation to the member’s interests in the entity.

## Schedule 3

## 5  Application of amendments

(1)       The amendments made by items 2 and 3 apply in relation to expenditure incurred on or after 12 May 2004.

(2)       Those amendments do not apply to expenditure incurred by an entity to acquire an IRU if:

                     (a)  the IRU was acquired by the entity before 12 May 2004; and

                     (b)  the entity becomes a member of a consolidated group or MEC group on or after that day; and

                     (c)  because of subsection 701‑55(2) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_, the IRU is taken to have been acquired on or after that day.

(3)       However, if:

                     (a)  an entity incurs expenditure on or after 12 May 2004 relating to an IRU (the **_new right_**) granted to the entity on or after that day for a cable system; and

                     (b)  before that day, the entity had another IRU (the **_earlier right_**) to use that cable system;

then, to the extent (if any) that the new right covers the level of capacity over that cable system that the earlier right covered, the amendments made by items 2 and 3 do not apply to so much of the expenditure as is reasonably attributable to that level of capacity.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 4  Application of Schedule 3 and 4 amendments

The repeals and amendments made by Schedules 3 and 4 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2007‑08 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

_Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Act 2007 (No. 143, 2007)_

## Schedule 1

## 222  Application

Subject to items 223 and 224, the amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to income years, statutory accounting periods and notional accounting periods starting on or after the first 1 July that occurs after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent.

## 225  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 226  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example:    For the 2006‑07 income year, Smart Investor Pty Ltd, an Australian resident private investment company, has assessable foreign income in the passive income class on which it has paid foreign tax for which it wishes to claim a foreign tax credit. The company also has a tax loss for the year from its Australian investments. When it lodges its tax return for the year it does not elect to claim a deduction for any of the tax loss under section 79DA of the ITAA 1936, because the Australian tax payable on its passive foreign income equals the foreign tax it has paid.

                   In 2009 the amount of foreign tax payable in respect of some foreign rental income it had included in its return for the 2006‑07 year is reduced and Smart Investor receives a refund of the difference in foreign tax. Smart Investor Pty Ltd then applies to be able to make an election under section 79DA, that is, after the _Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 4) Act 2007_ (which repeals section 79DA) receives Royal Assent. The Commissioner allows Smart Investor to submit an election to claim a deduction for so much of its 2006‑07 tax loss as to reduce the amount of Australian tax payable on its 2006‑07 assessable foreign income to the revised foreign tax paid, by the end of 2009.

                   Despite the repeal of section 79DA, item 226 allows the Commissioner to permit an election to be lodged after the return for 2006‑07 has been lodged, and to amend Smart Investor’s assessment for that year, because these actions relate to a thing done, and periods ending, before the repeal of section 79DA applies.

## Schedule 5

## 48  Application

(1)       The amendments made by this Schedule apply to the 2007‑2008 income year and later years.

Entitlement to deduction

## Schedule 4

## 1  Application of repeals and amendments

(1)       The repeals and amendments made by this Act apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2011; and

                     (b)  so far as they relate to income years but do not affect assessments—to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2011; and

                     (c)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, states of affairs existing, or periods ending on or after the commencement of the first income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011.

_Note:       For the purposes of an assessment for an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011, regard may still be had to acts done or omitted to be done, states of affairs existing, or periods ending during an earlier income year. For example, regard may be had to expenditure incurred by other entities in income years commencing before 1 July 2011 for the purposes of paragraph 355‑415(1)(b) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997._

(2)       However, each of the following applies in relation to the 2011‑12 financial year and all later financial years:

                     (a)  section 29E of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ (as inserted by Schedule 2);

                     (b)  the repeal of paragraph 39H(b) of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_;

                     (c)  section 46 of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ (as amended by this Act).

## 2  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 3  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things etc., in relation to past matters

(1)       Even though a provision is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Note:          Examples of things covered by this subitem are as follows:

(a)    an eligible company may object under Part IVC of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ in an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011 about a notice given under former section 73I of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for an income year commencing before 1 July 2011;

(b)    an eligible company seeking registration under former section 39J of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ for an income year commencing before 1 July 2011 may do so during an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011;

(c)    Innovation Australia may give a certificate under former section 39M of the _Industry Research and Development Act 1986_ in an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011 about research and development activities registered for an income year commencing before 1 July 2011.

(2)       Even though a provision is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded so far as it relates to a state of affairs:

                     (a)  that exists after the repeal or amendment applies; and

                     (b)  that relates to:

                              (i)  an act done or omitted to be done; or

                             (ii)  a state of affairs existing; or

                            (iii)  a period ending;

                            before the repeal or amendment applies.

Note:          Examples of things covered by this subitem are as follows:

(a)    an amount may be included in an eligible company’s assessable income under former subsection 73BF(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011 if the company receives in that income year an amount for the results of research and development activities for which the company had deductions under former section 73BA of that Act in an income year commencing before 1 July 2011;

(b)    an eligible company’s deduction under section 73B of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for expenditure incurred during an income year commencing before 1 July 2011 is reduced because of section 73C of that Act if, in an income year commencing on or after 1 July 2011, the company receives a recoupment of that expenditure from the Commonwealth.

(3)       To avoid doubt, this item extends to the repeal of subsection 286‑75(3), and paragraph 286‑80(2)(b), in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_. In particular, if, in a particular case, the period in respect of which an administrative penalty is payable under subsection 286‑75(3) in that Schedule:

                     (a)  has not begun; or

                     (b)  has begun but not ended;

when those provisions are repealed, then, despite the repeal, those provisions continue to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 4  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 5  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on a provision that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

This Schedule does not limit the operation of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.
