## SCH
<sch>                                  THE  SCHEDULE<lf>                                                                        Section 2 <lf>         THE  CONSTITUTION  OF  THE  INTERNATIONAL  LABOUR  ORGANISATION<lf> <lf>                                     PREAMBLE<lf> <lf>   Whereas universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based<lf> upon social justice;<lf> <lf>   And whereas conditions of labour exist involving such injustice, hardship and<lf> privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the<lf> peace and harmony of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of those<lf> conditions is urgently required: as, for example, by the regulation of the hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the<lf> regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision<lf> of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness,<lf> disease and injury arising out of his employment, the protection of children,<lf> young persons and women, provision for old age and injury, protection of the<lf> interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own,<lf> recognition of the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value,<lf> recognition of the principle of freedom of association, the organisation of<lf> vocational and technical education and other measures;<lf> <lf>   Whereas also the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions<lf> in their own countries;<lf> <lf>   The HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES, moved by sentiments of justice and humanity as<lf> well as by the desire to secure the permanent peace of the world, and with a<lf> view to attaining the objectives set forth in this Preamble, agree to the<lf> following Constitution of the International Labour Organisation:<lf> <lf>                             CHAPTER  I-ORGANISATION<lf> <lf>                                    Article 1<lf> <lf>   1\. A permanent organisation is hereby established for the promotion of the<lf> objects set forth in the Preamble to this Constitution and in the Declaration<lf> concerning the aims and purposes of the International Labour Organisation<lf> adopted at Philadelphia on 10 May 1944 the text of which is annexed to this<lf> Constitution.<lf> 

<lf>   2\. The Members of the International Labour Organisation shall be the States<lf> which were Members of the Organisation on 1 November 1945, and such other States as may become Members in pursuance of the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of<lf> this Article.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. Any original Member of the United Nations and any State admitted to<lf> membership of the United Nations by a decision of the General Assembly in<lf> accordance with the provisions of the Charter may become a Member of the<lf> International Labour Organisation by communicating to the Director-General of<lf> the International Labour Office its formal acceptance of the obligations of the<lf> Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.<lf> <p><lf>   4\. The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation may also<lf> admit Members to the Organisation by a vote concurred in by two thirds of the<lf> delegates attending the session, including two thirds of the Government<lf> delegates present and voting. Such admission shall take effect on the<lf> communication to the Director-General of the International Labour Office by the<lf> Government of the new Member of its formal acceptance of the obligations of the<lf> Constitution of the Organisation.<lf> <p><lf>   5\. No Member of the International Labour Organisation may withdraw from the<lf> Organisation without giving notice of its intention so to do to the<lf> Director-General of the International Labour Office. Such notice shall take<lf> effect two years after the date of its reception by the Director-General,<lf> subject to the Member having at that time fulfilled all financial obligations<lf> arising out of its membership. When a Member has ratified any International<lf> Labour Convention, such withdrawal shall not affect the continued validity for<lf> the period provided for in the Convention of all obligations arising thereunder<lf> or relating thereto.<lf> <p><lf>   6\. In the event of any State having ceased to be a Member of the Organisation, its readmission to membership shall be governed by the provisions of paragraph 3 or paragraph 4 of this Article as the case may be.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 2<lf> <lf>   The permanent organisation shall consist of:<lf> <lf>   (a)  a General Conference of representatives of the Members;<lf> <lf>   (b)  a Governing Body composed as described in Article 7; and<lf> <lf>   (c)  an International Labour Office controlled by the Governing Body.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 3<lf> <lf>   1\. The meetings of the General Conference of representatives of the Members<lf> shall be held from time to time as occasion may require, and at least once in<lf> every year. It shall be composed of four representatives of each of the Members, of whom two shall be Government delegates and the two others shall be delegates<lf> representing respectively the employers and the workpeople of each of the<lf> Members.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. Each delegate may be accompanied by advisers, who shall not exceed two in<lf> number for each item on the agenda of the meeting. When questions specially<lf> affecting women are to be considered by the Conference, one at least of the<lf> advisers should be a woman.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. Each Member which is responsible for the international relations of<lf> non-metropolitan territories may appoint as additional advisers to each of its<lf> delegates:<lf> <lf>   (a)  persons nominated by it as representatives of any such territory in<lf> regard to matters within the self-governing powers of that territory; and<lf> <lf>   (b)  persons nominated by it to advise its delegates in regard to matters<lf> concerning non-self-governing territories.<lf> <p><lf>   4\. In the case of a territory under the joint authority of two or more<lf> Members, persons may be nominated to advise the delegates of such Members.<lf> <p><lf>   5\. The Members undertake to nominate non-Government delegates and advisers<lf> chosen in agreement with the industrial organisations, if such organisations<lf> exist, which are most representative of employers or workpeople, as the case may be, in their respective countries.<lf> <p><lf>   6\. Advisers shall not speak except on a request made by the delegate whom they accompany and by the special authorization of the President of the Conference,<lf> and may not vote.<lf> <p><lf>   7\. A delegate may by notice in writing addressed to the President appoint one<lf> of his advisers to act as his deputy, and the adviser, while so acting, shall be allowed to speak and vote.<lf> <p><lf>   8\. The names of the delegates and their advisers will be communicated to the<lf> International Labour Office by the Government of each of the Members.<lf> <p><lf>   9\. The credentials of delegates and their advisers shall be subject to<lf> scrutiny by the Conference, which may, by two thirds of the votes cast by the<lf> delegates present, refuse to admit any delegate or adviser whom it deems not to<lf> have been nominated in accordance with this Article.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 4<lf> <lf>   1\. Every delegate shall be entitled to vote individually on all matters which<lf> are taken into consideration by the Conference.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. If one of the Members fails to nominate one of the non-Government delegates whom it is entitled to nominate, the other non-Government delegate shall be<lf> allowed to sit and speak at the Conference, but not to vote.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. If in accordance with Article 3 the Conference refuses admission to a<lf> delegate of one of the Members, the provisions of the present Article shall<lf> apply as if that delegate had not been nominated.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 5<lf> <lf>   The meetings of the Conference shall, subject to any decisions which may have<lf> been taken by the Conference itself at a previous meeting, be held at such place as may be decided by the Governing Body.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 6<lf> <lf>   Any change in the seat of the International Labour Office shall be decided by<lf> the Conference by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast by the delegates<lf> present.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 7<lf> <lf>   1\. The Governing Body shall consist of thirty-two persons:<lf> <lf>    Sixteen representing Governments,<lf> <lf>    Eight representing the employers, and<lf> <lf>    Eight representing the workers.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. Of the sixteen persons representing Governments, eight shall be appointed<lf> by the Members of chief industrial importance, and eight shall be appointed by<lf> the Members selected for that purpose by the Government delegates to the<lf> Conference, excluding the delegates of the eight Members mentioned above. Of the sixteen Members represented, six shall be non-European States.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. The Governing Body shall as occasion requires determine which are the<lf> Members of the Organisation of chief industrial importance and shall make rules<lf> to ensure that all questions relating to the selection of the Members of chief<lf> industrial importance are considered by an impartial committee before being<lf> decided by the Governing Body. Any appeal made by a Member from the declaration<lf> of the Governing Body as to which are the Members of chief industrial importance shall be decided by the Conference, but an appeal to the Conference shall not<lf> suspend the application of the declaration until such time as the Conference<lf> decides the appeal.<lf> <p><lf>   4\. The persons representing the employers and the persons representing the<lf> workers shall be elected respectively by the employers' delegates and the<lf> workers' delegates to the Conference. Two employers' representatives and two<lf> workers' representatives shall belong to non-European States.<lf> <p><lf>   5\. The period of office of the Governing Body shall be three years. If for any reason the Governing Body elections do not take place on the expiry of this<lf> period, the Governing Body shall remain in office until such elections are held. <p><lf>   6\. The method of filling vacancies and of appointing substitutes and other<lf> similar questions may be decided by the Governing Body subject to the approval<lf> of the Conference.<lf> <p><lf>   7\. The Governing Body shall, from time to time, elect from its number a<lf> Chairman and two Vice-Chairmen, of whom one shall be a person representing a<lf> Government, one a person representing the employers, and one a person<lf> representing the workers.<lf> <p><lf>   8\. The Governing Body shall regulate its own procedure and shall fix its own<lf> times of meeting. A special meeting shall be held if a written request to that<lf> effect is made by at least twelve of the representatives on the Governing Body.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 8<lf> <lf>   1\. There shall be a Director-General of the International Labour Office, who<lf> shall be appointed by the Governing Body, and, subject to the instructions of<lf> the Governing Body, shall be responsible for the efficient conduct of the<lf> International Labour Office and for such other duties as may be assigned to him. <p><lf>   2\. The Director-General or his deputy shall attend all meetings of the<lf> Governing Body.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 9<lf> <lf>   1\. The staff of the International Labour Office shall be appointed by the<lf> Director-General under regulations approved by the Governing Body.<lf> <p><lf>   2\.

A certain number of these persons shall be women.<lf> <p><lf>   4\. The responsibilities of the Director-General and the staff shall be<lf> exclusively international in character. In the performance of their duties, the<lf> Director-General and the staff shall not seek or receive instructions from any<lf> Government or from any other authority external to the Organisation.

Each Member of the Organisation undertakes to respect the exclusively<lf> international character of the responsibilities of the Director-General and the<lf> staff and not to seek to influence them in the discharge of their<lf> responsibilities.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 10<lf> <lf>   1\. The functions of the International Labour Office shall include the<lf> collection and distribution of information on all subjects relating to the<lf> international adjustment of conditions of industrial life and labour, and<lf> particularly the examination of subjects which it is proposed to bring before<lf> the Conference with a view to the conclusion of international Conventions, and<lf> the conduct of such special investigations as may be ordered by the Conference<lf> or by the Governing Body.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. Subject to such directions as the Governing Body may give, the Office will- <lf>   (a)  prepare the documents on the various items of the agenda for the meetings of the Conference;<lf> <lf>   (b)  accord to Governments at their request all appropriate assistance within<lf> its power in connection with the framing of laws and regulations on the basis of the decisions of the Conference and the improvement of administrative practices<lf> and systems of inspection;<lf> <lf>   (c)  carry out the duties required of it by the provisions of this<lf> Constitution in connection with the effective observance of Conventions;<lf> <lf>   (d)  edit and issue, in such languages as the Governing Body may think<lf> desirable, publications dealing with problems of industry and employment of<lf> international interest.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. Generally, it shall have such other powers and duties as may be assigned to it by the Conference or by the Governing Body.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 11<lf> <lf>   The Government departments of any of the Members which deal with questions of<lf> industry and employment may communicate directly with the Director-General<lf> through the representative of their Government on the Governing Body of the<lf> International Labour Office or, failing any such representative, through such<lf> other qualified official as the Government may nominate for the purpose.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 12<lf> <lf>   1\. The International Labour Organisation shall co-operate within the terms of<lf> this Constitution with any general international organisation entrusted with the co-ordination of the activities of public international organisations having<lf> specialised responsibilities and with public international organisations having<lf> specialised responsibilities in related fields.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. The International Labour Organisation may make appropriate arrangements for the representatives of public international organisations to participate without vote in its deliberations.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. The International Labour Organisation may make suitable arrangements for<lf> such consultation as it may think desirable with recognised non-governmental<lf> international organisations, including international organisations of employers, workers, agriculturists and co-operators.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 13<lf> <lf>   1\. The International Labour Organisation may make such financial and budgetary arrangements with the United Nations as may appear appropriate.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. Pending the conclusion of such arrangements or if at any time no such<lf> arrangements are in force-<lf> <lf>   (a)  each of the Members will pay the travelling and subsistence expenses of<lf> its delegates and their advisers and of its representatives attending the<lf> meetings of the Conference or the Governing Body, as the case may be;<lf> <lf>   (b)  all other expenses of the International Labour Office and of the meetings of the Conference or Governing Body shall be paid by the Director-General of the International Labour Office out of the general funds of the International Labour Organisation;<lf> <lf>   (c)  the arrangements for the approval, allocation and collection of the<lf> budget of the International Labour Organisation shall be determined by the<lf> Conference by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast by the delegates present,<lf> and shall provide for the approval of the budget and of the arrangements for the allocation of expenses among the Members of the Organisation by a committee of<lf> Government representatives.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. The expenses of the International Labour Organisation shall be borne by the Members in accordance with the arrangements in force in virtue of paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 (c) of this Article.<lf> <p><lf>   4\. A Member of the Organisation which is in arrears in the payment of its<lf> financial contribution to the Organisation shall have no vote in the Conference, in the Governing Body, in any committee, or in the elections of members of the<lf> Governing Body, if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years: Provided that the<lf> Conference may by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast by the delegates<lf> present permit such a Member to vote if it is satisfied that the failure to pay<lf> is due to conditions beyond the control of the Member.<lf> <p><lf>   5\. The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall be<lf> responsible to the Governing Body for the proper expenditure of the funds of the International Labour Organisation.<lf> <p><lf>                              CHAPTER  II-PROCEDURE<lf> <lf>                                    Article 14<lf> <lf>   1\. The agenda for all meetings of the Conference will be settled by the<lf> Governing Body, which shall consider any suggestion as to the agenda that may be made by the Government of any of the Members or by any representative<lf> organisation recognised for the purpose of Article 3, or by any public<lf> international organisation.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. The Governing Body shall make rules to ensure thorough technical<lf> preparation and adequate consultation of the Members primarily concerned, by<lf> means of a preparatory Conference or otherwise, prior to the adoption of a<lf> Convention or Recommendation by the Conference.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 15<lf> <lf>   1\. The Director-General shall act as the Secretary-General of the Conference,<lf> and shall transmit the agenda so as to reach the Members four months before the<lf> meeting of the Conference, and, through them, the non-Government delegates when<lf> appointed.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. The reports on each item of the agenda shall be despatched so as to reach<lf> the Members in time to permit adequate consideration before the meeting of the<lf> Conference. The Governing Body shall make rules for the application of this<lf> provision.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 16<lf> <lf>   1\. Any of the Governments of the Members may formally object to the inclusion<lf> of any item or items in the agenda. The grounds for such objection shall be set<lf> forth in a statement addressed to the Director-General who shall circulate it to all the Members of the Organisation.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. Items to which such objection has been made shall not, however, be excluded from the agenda, if at the Conference a majority of two thirds of the votes cast by the delegates present is in favour of considering them.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. If the Conference decides (otherwise than under the preceding paragraph) by two thirds of the votes cast by the delegates present that any subject shall be<lf> considered by the Conference, that subject shall be included in the agenda for<lf> the following meeting.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 17<lf> <lf>   1\. The Conference shall elect a President and three Vice-Presidents. One of<lf> the Vice-Presidents shall be a Government delegate, one an employers' delegate<lf> and one a workers' delegate. The Conference shall regulate its own procedure and may appoint committees to consider and report on any matter.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Constitution or by the terms of any Convention or other instrument conferring powers on the Conference or of<lf> the financial and budgetary arrangements adopted in virtue of Article 13, all<lf> matters shall be decided by a simple majority of the votes cast by the delegates present.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. The voting is void unless the total number of votes cast is equal to half<lf> the number of the delegates attending the Conference.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 18<lf> <lf>   The Conference may add to any committees which it appoints technical experts<lf> without power to vote.<lf> <p><lf>                                    Article 19<lf> <lf>   1\. When the Conference has decided on the adoption of proposals with regard to an item in the agenda, it will rest with the Conference to determine whether<lf> these proposals should take the form: (a) of an international Convention, or (b) of a Recommendation to meet circumstances where the subject, or aspect of it,<lf> dealt with is not considered suitable or appropriate at that time for a<lf> Convention.<lf> <p><lf>   2\. In either case a majority of two thirds of the votes cast by the delegates<lf> present shall be necessary on the final vote for the adoption of the Convention<lf> or Recommendation, as the case may be, by the Conference.<lf> <p><lf>   3\. In framing any Convention or Recommendation of general application the<lf> Conference shall have due regard to those countries in which climatic<lf> conditions, the imperfect development of industrial organisation, or other<lf> special circumstances make the industrial conditions substantially different and shall suggest the modifications, if any, which it considers may be required to<lf> meet the case of such countries.<lf> <p><lf>   4\. Two copies of the Convention or Recommendation shall be authenticated by<lf> the signatures of the President of the Conference and of the Director-General.<lf> Of these copies one shall be deposited in the archives of the International<lf> Labour Office and the other with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<lf> The Director-General will communicate a certified copy of the Convention or<lf> Recommendation to each of the Members.<lf> <p><lf>   5\.

   ----------<lf> <lf>                                      ANNEX<lf> <lf> DECLARATION  CONCERNING  THE  AIMS  AND  PURPOSES  OF  THE  INTERNATIONAL<lf>                               LABOUR  ORGANISATION<lf> <lf>   The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, meeting in<lf> its Twenty-sixth Session in Philadelphia, hereby adopts, this tenth day of May<lf> in the year nineteen hundred and forty-four, the present Declaration of the aims and purposes of the International Labour Organisation and of the principles<lf> which should inspire the policy of its Members.<lf> <p><lf>                                        I<lf> <lf>   The Conference reaffirms the fundamental principles on which the Organisation<lf> is based and, in particular, that:<lf> <lf>   (a)  labour is not a commodity;<lf> <lf>   (b)  freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustained<lf> progress;<lf> <lf>   (c)  poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere;<lf> <lf>   (d)  the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour<lf> within each nation, and by continuous and concerted international effort in<lf> which the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal status with<lf> those of Governments, join with them in free discussion and democratic decision<lf> with a view to the promotion of the common welfare.<lf> <p><lf>                                        II<lf> <lf>   Believing that experience has fully demonstrated the truth of the statement in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation that lasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice, the Conference affirms<lf> that:<lf> <lf>   (a)  all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to<lf> pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development in<lf> conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity;<lf> <lf>   (b)  the attainment of the conditions in which this shall be possible must<lf> constitute the central aim of national and international policy;<lf> <lf>   (c)  all national and international policies and measures, in particular those of an economic and financial character, should be judged in this light and<lf> accepted only in so far as they may be held to promote and not to hinder the<lf> achievement of this fundamental objective;<lf> <lf>   (d)  it is a responsibility of the International Labour Organisation to<lf> examine and consider all international economic and financial policies and<lf> measures in the light of this fundamental objective;<lf> <lf>   (e) in discharging the tasks entrusted to it the International Labour<lf> Organisation, having considered all relevant economic and financial factors, may include in its decisions and recommendations any provisions which it considers<lf> appropriate.<lf> <p><lf>                                       III<lf> <lf>   The Conference recognizes the solemn obligation of the International Labour<lf> Organisation to further among the nations of the world programmes which will<lf> achieve:<lf> <lf>   (a)  full employment and the raising of standards of living;<lf> <lf>   (b)  the employment of workers in the occupations in which they can have the<lf> satisfaction of giving the fullest measure of their skill and attainments and<lf> make their greatest contribution to the common well-being;<lf> <lf>   (c)  the provision, as a means to the attainment of this end and under<lf> adequate guarantees for all concerned, of facilities for training and the<lf> transfer of labour, including migration for employment and settlement;<lf> <lf>   (d)  policies in regard to wages and earnings, hours and other conditions of<lf> work calculated to ensure a just share of the fruits of progress to all, and a<lf> minimum living wage to all employed and in need of such protection;<lf> <lf>   (e)  the effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining, the<lf> co-operation of management and labour in the continuous improvement of<lf> productive efficiency, and the collaboration of workers and employers in the<lf> preparation and application of social and economic measures;<lf> <lf>   (f)  the extension of social security measures to provide a basic income to<lf> all in need of such protection and comprehensive medical care;<lf> <lf>   (g)  adequate protection for the life and health of workers in all<lf> occupations;<lf> <lf>   (h)  provision for child welfare and maternity protection;<lf> <lf>    (i)  the provision of adequate nutrition, housing and facilities for<lf> recreation and culture;<lf> <lf>    (j)  the assurance of equality of educational and vocational opportunity.<lf> <p><lf>                                        IV<lf> <lf>   Confident that the fuller and broader utilisation of the world's productive<lf> resources necessary for the achievement of the objectives set forth in this<lf> Declaration can be secured by effective international and national action,<lf> including measures to expand production and consumption, to avoid severe<lf> economic fluctuations, to promote the economic and social advancement of the<lf> less developed regions of the world, to assure greater stability in world prices of primary products, and to promote a high and steady volume of international<lf> trade, the Conference pledges the full co-operation of the International Labour<lf> Organisation with such international bodies as may be entrusted with a share of<lf> the responsibility for this great task and for the promotion of the health,<lf> education and well-being of all peoples.<lf> <p><lf>                                        V<lf> <lf>   The Conference affirms that the principles set forth in this Declaration are<lf> fully applicable to all peoples everywhere and that, while the manner of their<lf> application must be determined with
