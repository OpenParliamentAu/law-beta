A permanent organisation is hereby established for the promotion of the objects set forth in the Preamble to this Constitution and in the Declaration concerning the aims and purposes of the International Labour Organisation adopted at Philadelphia on 10 May 1944 the text of which is annexed to this Constitution.<lf> <lf>   2\. The Members of the International Labour Organisation shall be the States which were Members of the Organisation on 1 November 1945, and such other States as may become Members in pursuance of the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article.<lf> <lf>   3\. Any original Member of the United Nations and any State admitted to membership of the United Nations by a decision of the General Assembly in accordance with the provisions of the Charter may become a Member of the International Labour Organisation by communicating to the Director-General of the International Labour Office its formal acceptance of the obligations of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.<lf> <lf>   4\. The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation may also admit Members to the Organisation by a vote concurred in by two thirds of the delegates attending the session, including two thirds of the Government delegates present and voting. Such admission shall take effect on the communication to the Director-General of the International Labour Office by the Government of the new Member of its formal acceptance of the obligations of the Constitution of the Organisation.<lf> <lf>   5\. No Member of the International Labour Organisation may withdraw from the Organisation without giving notice of its intention so to do to the Director-General of the International Labour Office. Such notice shall take effect two years after the date of its reception by the Director-General, subject to the Member having at that time fulfilled all financial obligations arising out of its membership. When a Member has ratified any International Labour Convention, such withdrawal shall not affect the continued validity for the period provided for in the Convention of all obligations arising thereunder or relating thereto.<lf> <lf>   6\. In the event of any State having ceased to be a Member of the Organisation, its readmission to membership shall be governed by the provisions of paragraph 3 or paragraph 4 of this Article as the case may be.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 2<lf> <lf>   The permanent organisation shall consist of:<lf> <lf>   (a)  a General Conference of representatives of the Members;<lf> <lf>   (b)  a Governing Body composed as described in Article 7; and<lf> <lf>   (c)  an International Labour Office controlled by the Governing Body.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 3<lf> <lf>   1\.

The names of the delegates and their advisers will be communicated to the International Labour Office by the Government of each of the Members.<lf> <lf>   9\.

In either case a majority of two thirds of the votes cast by the delegates present shall be necessary on the final vote for the adoption of the Convention or Recommendation, as the case may be, by the Conference.<lf> <lf>   3\. In framing any Convention or Recommendation of general application the Conference shall have due regard to those countries in which climatic conditions, the imperfect development of industrial organization, or other special circumstances make the industrial conditions substantially different and shall suggest the modifications, if any, which it considers may be required to meet the case of such countries.<lf> <lf>   4\.

In the case of a federal State, the following provisions shall apply:<lf> <lf>   (a)  in respect of Conventions and Recommendations which the federal Government regards as appropriate under its constitutional system for federal action, the obligations of the federal State shall be the same as those of Members which are not federal States;<lf> <lf>   (b)  in respect of Conventions and Recommendations which the federal Government regards as appropriate under its constitutional system, in whole or in part, for action by the constituent States, provinces, or cantons rather than for federal action, the federal Government shall-<lf> <lf>       (i)  make, in accordance with its Constitution and the Constitutions of the States, provinces or cantons concerned, effective arrangements for the reference of such Conventions and Recommendations not later than eighteen months from the closing of the session of the Conference to the appropriate federal, State, provincial or cantonal authorities for the enactment of legislation or other action;<lf> <lf>      (ii)  arrange, subject to the concurrence of the State, provincial or cantonal Governments concerned, for periodical consultations between the federal and the State, provincial or cantonal authorities with a view to promoting within the federal State co-ordinated action to give effect to the provisions of such Conventions and Recommendations;<lf> <lf>      (iii)  inform the Director-General of the International Labour Office of the measures taken in accordance with this article to bring such Conventions and Recommendations before the appropriate federal, State, provincial or cantonal authorities with particulars of the authorities regarded as appropriate and of the action taken by them;<lf> <lf>      (iv)  in respect of each such Convention which it has not ratified, report to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, at appropriate intervals as requested by the Governing Body, the position of the law and practice of the federation and its constituent States, provinces or cantons in regard to the Convention, showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Convention by legislation, administrative action, collective agreement, or otherwise;<lf> <lf>      (v)  in respect of each such Recommendation, report to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, at appropriate intervals as requested by the Governing Body, the position of the law and practice of the federation and its constituent States, provinces or cantons in regard to the Recommendation, showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to the provisions of the Recommendation and such modifications of these provisions as have been found or may be found necessary in adopting or applying them.<lf> <lf>   8\.

The Governing Body may adopt the same procedure either of its own motion or on receipt of a complaint from a delegate to the Conference.<lf> <lf>   5\. When any matter arising out of Articles 25 or 26 is being considered by the Governing Body, the Government in question shall, if not already represented thereon, be entitled to send a representative to take part in the proceedings of the Governing Body while the matter is under consideration. Adequate notice of the date on which the matter will be considered shall be given to the Government in question.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 27<lf> <lf>   The Members agree that, in the event of the reference of a complaint to a Commission of Enquiry under Article 26, they will each, whether directly concerned in the complaint or not, place at the disposal of the Commission all the information in their possession which bears upon the subject matter of the complaint.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 28<lf> <lf>   When the Commission of Enquiry has fully considered the complaint, it shall prepare a report embodying its findings on all questions of fact relevant to determining the issue between the parties and containing such recommendations as it may think proper as to the steps which should be taken to meet the complaint and the time within which they should be taken.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 29<lf> <lf>   1\.

In the event of the Governing Body finding that there has been such a failure, it shall report the matter to the Conference.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 31<lf> <lf>   The decision of the International Court of Justice in regard to a complaint or matter which has been referred to it in pursuance of Article 29 shall be final. <lf> <lf>                                    Article 32<lf> <lf>   The International Court of Justice may affirm, vary or reverse any of the findings or recommendations of the Commission of Enquiry, if any.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 33<lf> <lf>   In the event of any Member failing to carry out within the time specified the recommendations, if any, contained in the report of the Commission of Enquiry, or in the decision of the International Court of Justice, as the case may be, the Governing Body may recommend to the Conference such action as it may deem wise and expedient to secure compliance therewith.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 34<lf> <lf>   The defaulting Government may at any time inform the Governing Body that it has taken the steps necessary to comply with the recommendations of the Commission of Enquiry or with those in the decision of the International Court of Justice, as the case may be, and may request it to constitute a Commission of Enquiry to verify its contention. In this case the provisions of Articles 27, 28, 29, 31 and 32 shall apply, and if the report of the Commission of Enquiry or the decision of the International Court of Justice is in favour of the defaulting Government, the Governing Body shall forthwith recommend the discontinuance of any action taken in pursuance of Article 33.<lf> <lf>                               CHAPTER  III-GENERAL<lf> <lf>                                    Article 35<lf> <lf>   1\.

Each Member which ratifies a Convention shall as soon as possible after ratification communicate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office a declaration stating in respect of the territories other than those referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 below the extent to which it undertakes that the provisions of the Convention shall be applied and giving such particulars as may be prescribed by the Convention.<lf> <lf>   3\.

If the obligations of a Convention are not accepted on behalf of a territory to which paragraph 4 or paragraph 5 of this Article relates, the Member or Members or international authority concerned shall report to the Director-General of the International Labour Office the position of the law and practice of that territory in regard to the matters dealt with in the Convention and the report shall show the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Convention by legislation, administrative action, collective agreement or otherwise and shall state the difficulties which prevent or delay the acceptance of such Convention.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 36<lf> <lf>   Amendments to this Constitution which are adopted by the Conference by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast by the delegates present shall take effect when ratified or accepted by two thirds of the Members of the Organisation including five of the eight Members which are represented on the Governing Body as Members of chief industrial importance in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 7 of this Constitution.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 37<lf> <lf>   1\. Any question or dispute relating to the interpretation of this Constitution or of any subsequent Convention concluded by the Members in pursuance of the provisions of this Constitution shall be referred for decision to the International Court of Justice.<lf> <lf>   2\.

Any applicable judgment or advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice shall be binding upon any tribunal established in virtue of this paragraph. Any award made by such a tribunal shall be circulated to the Members of the Organisation and any observations which they may make thereon shall be brought before the Conference.<lf> <lf>                                    Article 38<lf> <lf>   1\.

-----------------<lf> <lf>                                      ANNEX<lf> DECLARATION CONCERNING THE AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR<lf>                                   ORGANISATION<lf> <lf>   The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, meeting in its Twenty-sixth Session in Philadelphia, hereby adopts, this tenth day of May in the year nineteen hundred and forty-four, the present Declaration of the aims and purposes of the International Labour Organisation and of the principles which should inspire the policy of its Members.<lf> <lf>                                        I<lf> <lf>   The Conference reaffirms the fundamental principles on which the Organisation is based and, in particular, that:<lf> <lf>   (a)  labour is not a commodity;<lf> <lf>   (b)  freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustained progress;<lf> <lf>   (c)  poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere;<lf> <lf>   (d)  the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within each nation, and by continuous and concerted international effort in which the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal status with those of Governments, join with them in free discussion and democratic decision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare.<lf> <lf>                                        II<lf> <lf>   Believing that experience has fully demonstrated the truth of the statement in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation that lasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice, the Conference affirms that:<lf> <lf>   (a)  all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity;<lf> <lf>   (b)  the attainment of the conditions in which this shall be possible must constitute the central aim of national and international policy;<lf> <lf>   (c)  all national and international policies and measures, in particular those of an economic and financial character, should be judged in this light and accepted only in so far as they may be held to promote and not to hinder the achievement of this fundamental objective;<lf> <lf>   (d)  it is a responsibility of the International Labour Organisation to examine and consider all international economic and financial policies and measures in the light of this fundamental objective;<lf> <lf>   (e)  in discharging the tasks entrusted to it the International Labour Organisation, having considered all relevant economic and financial factors, may include in its decisions and recommendations any provisions which it considers appropriate.<lf> <lf>                                       III<lf> <lf>   The Conference recognises the solemn obligation of the International Labour Organisation to further among the nations of the world programmes which will achieve:<lf> <lf>   (a)  full employment and the raising of standards of living;<lf> <lf>   (b)  the employment of workers in the occupations in which they can have the satisfaction of giving the fullest measure of their skill and attainments and make their greatest contribution to the common well-being;<lf> <lf>   (c)  the provision, as a means to the attainment of this end and under adequate guarantees for all concerned, of facilities for training and the transfer of labour, including migration for employment and settlement;<lf> <lf>   (d)  policies in regard to wages and earnings, hours and other conditions of work calculated to ensure a just share of the fruits of progress to all, and a minimum living wage to all employed and in need of such protection;<lf> <lf>   (e)  the effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining, the co-operation of management and labour in the continuous improvement of productive efficiency, and the collaboration of workers and employers in the preparation and application of social and economic measures;<lf> <lf>   (f)  the extension of social security measures to provide a basic income to all in need of such protection and comprehensive medical care;<lf> <lf>   (g)  adequate protection for the life and health of workers in all occupations;<lf> <lf>   (h)  provision for child welfare and maternity protection;<lf> <lf>   (i)  the provision of adequate nutrition, housing and facilities for recreation and culture;<lf> <lf>   (j)  the assurance of equality of educational and vocational opportunity.<lf> <lf>                                        IV<lf> <lf>   Confident that the fuller and broader utilisation of the world's productive resources necessary for the achievement of the objectives set forth in this Declaration can be secured by effective international and national action, including measures to expand production and consumption, to avoid severe economic fluctuations, to promote the economic and social advancement of the less developed regions of the world, to assure greater stability in world prices of primary products, and to promote a high and steady volume of international trade, the Conference pledges the full co-operation of the International Labour Organisation with such international bodies as may be entrusted with a share of the responsibility for this great task and for the promotion of the health, education and well-being of all peoples.<lf> <lf>                                        V<lf> <lf>   The Conference affirms that the principles set forth in this Declaration are fully applicable to all peoples everywhere and that, while the manner of their application must be determined with due regard to the stage of social and economic development reached by each people, their progressive application to peoples who are still dependent, as well as to those who have already achieved self-government, is a matter of concern to the whole civilised world.<lf> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- <lf>
