73  Minister may obtain information and documents
	(1)	If the Minister has reason to believe that a person is capable of giving information or producing documents about matters that are relevant to the exercise by the Minister of his or her powers under this Act, the Minister may, by notice in writing served on that person, require that person:
	(a)	to give any such information to the Minister within the time and in the manner specified in the notice; or
	(b)	to produce any such documents to the Minister within the time and in the manner specified in the notice; or
	(c)	to make copies of any such documents and to produce those copies to the Minister within the time and in the manner specified in the notice.
	(2)	A notice under subsection (1) must set out the effects of subsections (5) and (9) of this section and sections 137.1 and 137.2 of the Criminal Code.

	(9)	A person is not excused from giving information or producing a document or a copy of a document under this section on the ground that the information or the production of the document or copy might tend to incriminate the person, but:
	(a)	giving the information or producing the document or copy; or
	(b)	any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of giving the information or producing the document or copy;
is not admissible in evidence against the person in any criminal proceedings other than a prosecution for an offence against this section or an offence against section 137.1 or 137.2 of the Criminal Code that relates to this section.

	(12)	The Minister may, for the purposes of this Act, take, and retain for as long as is necessary for those purposes, a document produced under this section.
	(13)	The person otherwise entitled to possession of the document is entitled to be supplied, as soon as practicable, with a copy certified by the Minister to be a true copy.
	(14)	The certified copy must be received in all courts and tribunals as evidence as if it were the original.
	(15)	Until a certified copy is supplied, the Minister must, at such times and places as the Minister thinks appropriate, permit the person otherwise entitled to possession of the document, or a person authorised by that person, to inspect and make copies of, or take extracts from, the document.

	(5)	If:
	(a)	a person other than a company is convicted of an offence; and
	(b)	the person would not have been convicted of the offence if subsections (3) and (4) had not been enacted;
the person is not liable to be punished by imprisonment for that offence.
	(6)	A reference in subsection (1) or (3) to the state of mind of a person includes a reference to:
