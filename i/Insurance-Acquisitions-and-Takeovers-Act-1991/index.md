                     (a)  an offence committed before the commencement of this item; or

                     (b)  proceedings for an offence alleged to have been committed before the commencement of this item; or

                     (c)  any matter connected with, or arising out of, such proceedings;

as if the amendment or repeal had not been made.

(2)        Subitem (1) does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

## 419  Transitional—pre-commencement notices

If:

                     (a)  a provision in force immediately before the commencement of this item required that a notice set out the effect of one or more other provisions; and

                     (b)  any or all of those other provisions are repealed by this Schedule; and

                     (c)  the first-mentioned provision is amended by this Schedule;

_Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Amendment Act 2003 
 (No. 42, 2003)_

## Schedule 3

## 1  Definitions

In this Schedule:

**_amended Act_** means the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_ as in force after the commencement of the amendments.

**_commencement of the amendments_** means the commencement of the amendments made by Schedule 1.

**_old Act_** means the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_ as in force immediately before the commencement of the amendments.

## 2  APRA’s corporate existence is continued

(1)        The body corporate that was, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (**_APRA_**) continues in existence after that commencement by force of this item under the corporate structure provided for by the amended Act.

_Note:       Rights, liabilities and obligations as between APRA and other people, and things done by or on behalf of APRA, or in relation to APRA, are therefore not affected by the restructure of APRA._

(2)        However, this does not imply that any person who, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, was a member of APRA’s Board, or was APRA’s Chief Executive Officer, continues to hold office after that commencement.

_Note:       These people cease to hold office on the commencement of the amendments because of the repeal of the provisions under which they were appointed._

## 3  Continued protection from liability

Section 58 of the old Act continues to apply in relation to conduct, before the commencement of the amendments, of APRA’s Board, a member of APRA’s Board or an agent of a member of APRA’s Board.

_Note:       The reference to a member of APRA’s Board covers APRA’s Chief Executive Officer._

## 4  Continued effect of certain delegations

(1)        A delegation in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 15(1) or (2) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a delegation under APRA’s seal under that subsection of the amended Act. If the delegation was to one or more members of APRA’s Board, it continues to have effect as if it were a delegation to any APRA member.

(2)        A direction in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 15(3) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement, in relation to a delegation to which subitem (1) applies, as if it were a direction given by APRA under that subsection of the amended Act.

(3)        A delegation to one or more members of APRA’s Board in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under a provision amended by Schedule 2 continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a delegation under the amended provision to any APRA member.

_Note:       Delegations in favour of APRA, or APRA staff members, are not affected by the Schedule 2 amendments._

## 5  Continued effect of determinations of terms and conditions for staff and consultants

A determination of terms and conditions in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under subsection 45(2) or 47(2) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were a determination by APRA under that subsection of the amended Act.

## 6  Continued effect of approvals under paragraph 56(5)(b)

An approval in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph 56(5)(b) of the old Act continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were an approval by APRA under that paragraph of the amended Act.

## 7  Continued or extended effect of certain regulations

(1)        Regulations in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph (k) of the definition of **_Act covered by this section_** in subsection 56(1) of the old Act continue to have effect after that commencement as if they were made under paragraph (o) of the definition of **_prudential regulation framework law_** in subsection 3(1) of the amended Act, but only as that paragraph applies for the purposes of section 56 of the amended Act.

(2)        Regulations in force, immediately before the commencement of the amendments, under paragraph 56(5)(a) of the old Act have effect after that commencement (in addition to the effect they continue to have for that paragraph of the amended Act) as if they were also made under subsection 10A(1) of the amended Act.

## 8  Delegations by ASIC to APRA staff members

(1)        Subsection 102(2A) of the _Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001_ has effect after the commencement of the amendments as if the reference in that subsection to the Chief Executive Officer of APRA were instead a reference to APRA.

(2)        For the purposes of that subsection as it continues to have effect, an agreement to a delegation, in force under that subsection immediately before the commencement of the amendments, continues to have effect after that commencement as if it were given by APRA.

_Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform) Act 2008 (No. 144, 2008)_

## Schedule 14

## 119  Transitional provision

If:

                     (a)  apart from this item, a person would be an associate of another person for the purposes of a provision of the _Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991_ on the day on which the amendments made by this Part commence; and

                     (b)  the persons would be associates only because of those amendments;

then, during the period of 6 months starting on that day, the provision does not apply to them as associates of each other for so long as the persons would otherwise have been associates of each other.
