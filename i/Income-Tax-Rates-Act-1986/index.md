                              (i)  whichever of the following amounts is applicable: 

                                        (A)  if Division 392 (Long‑term averaging of primary producers’ tax liability) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies—the average income worked out under section 392‑45 of that Act;

                                        (B)  if sub-subparagraph (A) does not apply—the reduced taxable income; and

                             (ii)  20% of the part of the special income component other than the eligible part of the special income component; and 

                     (d)  the amount of tax that would be payable by the taxpayer under clause 1 of Part I of Schedule 7 on a taxable income equal to the average income worked out under section 392‑45 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ or reduced taxable income, as the case may be;

**_C_**  is 45% of the eligible part of the special income component; and

**_D_**  is the number of whole dollars in the taxable income. 

In applying the formula, component **_B_** is to be worked out on the assumption that the whole of the taxable income is ordinary taxable income.

              1.  In the case of a non‑resident taxpayer who has an eligible taxable income for the purposes of Division 6AA of Part III of the Assessment Act and whose taxable income does not consist of or include a special income component, the rates of tax in respect of that part (in this clause referred to as the **_relevant part_**) of the taxable income of the taxpayer other than the eligible taxable income of the taxpayer are the rates that would be payable under Part II of Schedule 7 if the relevant part of that taxable income were the taxable income of the taxpayer. 

              2.  In the case of a non‑resident taxpayer who has an eligible taxable income for the purposes of Division 6AA of Part III of the Assessment Act and whose taxable income does not consist of or include a special income component, the rate of tax in respect of the eligible taxable income of the taxpayer is 45%. 

              3.  For every $1 of the taxable income of a non‑resident taxpayer: 

                     (a)  who has an eligible taxable income for the purposes of Division 6AA of Part III of the Assessment Act; and 

                     (b)  whose taxable income consists of or includes a special income component; 

the rate of tax is the amount ascertained in accordance with the formula ![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00617/Html/f70a6d8c-c970-4825-aa0d-87f9e9a8c9d7_files/image007.gif) where:

**_A_**  is the amount of tax that would be payable by the taxpayer under clauses 1 and 2 on a taxable income equal to the reduced taxable income;

**_B_**  is 5 times the difference between: 

                     (c)  the amount of tax that would be payable by the taxpayer under clause 1 of Part II of Schedule 7 on a taxable income equal to the sum of: 

                              (i)  whichever of the following amounts is applicable: 

                                        (A)  if Division 392 (Long‑term averaging of primary producers’ tax liability) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ applies—the average income worked out under section 392‑45 of that Act;

                                        (B)  if sub-subparagraph (A) does not apply—the reduced taxable income; and

                             (ii)  20% of the part of the special income component other than the eligible part of the special income component; and 

                     (d)  the amount of tax that would be payable by the taxpayer under clause 1 of Part II of Schedule 7 on a taxable income equal to the average income worked out under section 392‑45 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ or reduced taxable income, as the case may be;

**_C_**  is 45% of the eligible part of the special income component; and 

**_D_**  is the number of whole dollars in the taxable income. 

In applying the formula, component **_B_** is to be worked out on the assumption that the whole of the taxable income is ordinary taxable income.

                     (a)  an individual and your assessable income included a net capital gain; or

                     (b)  a trustee of a trust estate and, apart from the amendments made by this Act, clause 3 of Part I or clause 3 of Part II of Schedule 12 to the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ would have applied in working out your basic income tax liability; or

                     (c)  a trustee of a trust estate and Schedule 10 to the _Income Tax Rates Act 1986_ applied in working out your basic tax liability and, apart from the amendments made by this Act, the share of the net income of the trust estate referred to in that Schedule would consist of, or include, a capital gains component.

Only applies if capital gain made before the start time

(3)       This Part does not apply to you unless you made a capital gain as a result of a CGT event that happened during the income year and before the start time and the capital gain is not disregarded.

## 20  Meaning of start time

In this Part:

                    <a name="start-time"></a>**_start time_** means 11.45 am, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 21 September 1999.

## 21  Working out if you are entitled to a reduction

You are entitled to a reduction to your basic income tax liability if the following amounts are both greater than zero:

                     (a)  your gross adjustment amount under item 22;

                     (b)  your pre‑announcement net capital gain amount worked out under item 23.

The amount of the reduction is worked out under item 24.

## 22  Working out the gross adjustment amount

Work out your gross adjustment amount as follows:

* * *

_Method statement_

Step 1\. Work out the amount that would have been your basic income tax liability for the income year if the amendments made by:

               (a)     Schedules 8 and 9 to the _New Business Tax System (Integrity and Other Measures) Act 1999_; and

              (b)     Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Capital Gains Tax) Act 1999_;

              had not been made.

Step 2\. Work out the amount that would have been your basic income tax liability for the income year if the amendments made by:

               (a)     Schedules 8 and 9 to the _New Business Tax System (Integrity and Other Measures) Act 1999_; and

              (b)     Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Capital Gains Tax) Act 1999_; and

               (c)     Part 1 of this Schedule;

              had not been made.

Step 3.   Subtract the amount worked out under step 2 from the amount worked out under step 1\. The result is the **_gross adjustment amount_**.

              If the result is zero or negative, you are not entitled to any reduction.

* * *

## 23  Working out your net capital gain amounts

Working out your pre‑announcement net capital gain amount

(1)       Your **_pre‑announcement net capital gain amount_** is the amount that would have been your modified net capital gain amount if any capital gains or capital losses arising after the start time were disregarded.

Working out your modified net capital gain amount

(2)       Your **_modified net capital gain amount_** is the amount that would have been your net capital gain for the income year if:

                     (a)  the amendments made by:

                              (i)  Schedules 8 and 9 to the _New Business Tax System (Integrity and Other Measures) Act 1999_; and

                             (ii)  Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Capital Gains Tax) Act 1999_;

                            had not been made; and

                     (b)  you did not have any unapplied net capital losses from previous income years; and

                     (c)  any capital gains or losses that are:

                              (i)  part of the special income component and eligible taxable income for the purposes of Division 6AA of Part III of the Assessment Act; and

                             (ii)  part of the capital gains component and net income to which Division 6AA of Part III of the Assessment Act applies;

                            were disregarded.

## 24  Working out the amount of your reduction

(1)       The amount of the reduction in your basic income tax liability is worked out using the formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00617/Html/f70a6d8c-c970-4825-aa0d-87f9e9a8c9d7_files/image008.gif)

Working out your capital gain adjustment percentage

(2)       Your **_capital gain adjustment percentage_** is the percentage worked out using the following formula:

![](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00617/Html/f70a6d8c-c970-4825-aa0d-87f9e9a8c9d7_files/image009.gif)

## 25  Choices

If:

                     (a)  the calculation of an amount under this Part could be affected by a choice or election that you could make under the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ or the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_; and

                     (b)  apart from the operation of this Part, you would not need to have made that choice or election;

you may calculate the amount for the purpose of this Part as if you had made the election or choice.

## 26  Income from trust estates

To avoid doubt, if your assessable income includes a share of the net income of a trust estate, the assumptions and other adjustments required by this Part are taken, for the purpose of the operation of this Part to you, to have applied in relation to the calculation of the net income of the trust.

## 27  Interpretation

Expressions used in this Act that are defined in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ have the same meaning as in that Act.

_Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 
 (No. 101, 2006)_

## Schedule 6

## 1  Application of Schedule 1 and 2 amendments

Except as mentioned in items 2 and 3, the repeals and amendments made by Schedules 1 and 2 apply:

                     (a)  so far as they affect assessments—to assessments for the 2006‑07 income year and all later income years; and

                     (b)  otherwise—to acts done or omitted to be done, or states of affairs existing, after the commencement of the repeals and amendments.

## 6  Object

The object of this Part is to ensure that, despite the repeals and amendments made by this Act, the full legal and administrative consequences of:

                     (a)  any act done or omitted to be done; or

                     (b)  any state of affairs existing; or

                     (c)  any period ending;

before such a repeal or amendment applies, can continue to arise and be carried out, directly or indirectly through an indefinite number of steps, even if some or all of those steps are taken after the repeal or amendment applies.

## 7  Making and amending assessments, and doing other things, in relation to past matters

Even though an Act is repealed or amended by this Act, the repeal or amendment is disregarded for the purpose of doing any of the following under any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_):

                     (a)  making or amending an assessment (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

                     (b)  exercising any right or power, performing any obligation or duty or doing any other thing (including under a provision that is itself repealed or amended);

in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

Example 1: On 31 July 1999, Greg Ltd lodged its annual return under former section 160ARE of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The return stated that the company had a credit on its franking account and that no franking deficit tax was payable for the 1998‑99 franking year. Under former section 160ARH of that Act, the Commissioner was taken to have made an assessment consistent with the return.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of Part IIIAA of that Act, the Commissioner concludes that Greg Ltd fraudulently overfranked dividends it paid during the 1998‑99 franking year, and had a franking account deficit for that franking year. As a result, the Commissioner considers that franking deficit tax and a penalty by way of additional tax are payable.

                   The Commissioner can amend the assessment under former section 160ARN of that Act, because item 7 of this Schedule disregards the repeal of that section for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the 1998‑99 franking year. Item 7 will also disregard the repeal of Division 11 of former Part IIIAA to the extent necessary for the Commissioner to assess Greg Ltd’s liability to a penalty by way of additional tax.

                   Despite the repeal of sections 160ARU and 160ARV, item 9 will ensure that the general interest charge will accrue on the unpaid franking deficit tax and penalty until they are paid.

                   Item 7 will also preserve Greg Ltd’s right, under former section 160ART of that Act, to object against the Commissioner’s amended assessment (including the penalty), since the objection is the exercise of a right in relation to a franking year that ended before the repeal of Part IIIAA.

Example 2: During the 1997‑98 income year, Duffy Property Ltd withheld amounts from its employees’ wages as required by former Divisions 1AAA and 2 of Part VI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_. The company failed to notify the Commissioner of those amounts, and failed to remit them to the Commissioner.

                   Following an audit undertaken after the repeal of those Divisions, the Commissioner discovers that the withheld amounts have not been remitted. The company’s records are incomplete and the Commissioner is unable to completely ascertain the extent of its liability for the withheld amounts. Under section 222AGA of that Act, the Commissioner makes an estimate of the liability.

                   Item 7 will disregard the repeal of section 220AAZA of that Act (which empowered the Commissioner to recover the amount of the estimate). Even though the estimate is made after the repeal, it relates to amounts withheld before the repeal.

## 8  Saving of provisions about effect of assessments

If a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act deals with the effect of an assessment, the repeal or amendment is disregarded in relation to assessments made, before or after the repeal or amendment applies, in relation to any act done or omitted to be done, any state of affairs existing, or any period ending, before the repeal or amendment applies.

## 9  Saving of provisions about general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty

If:

                     (a)  a provision or part of a provision that is repealed or amended by this Act provides for the payment of:

                              (i)  general interest charge, failure to notify penalty or late reconciliation statement penalty (all within the meaning of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_); or

                             (ii)  interest under the _Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983_; and

                     (b)  in a particular case, the period in respect of which the charge, penalty or interest is payable (whether under the provision or under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_) has not begun, or has begun but not ended, when the provision is repealed or amended;

then, despite the repeal or amendment, the provision or part continues to apply in the particular case until the end of the period.

## 10  Repeals disregarded for the purposes of dependent provisions

If the operation of a provision (the **_subject provision_**) of any Act or legislative instrument (within the meaning of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_) made under any Act depends to any extent on an Act, or a provision of an Act, that is repealed by this Act, the repeal is disregarded so far as it affects the operation of the subject provision.

## 11  Schedule does not limit operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_

This Schedule does not limit the operation of section 8 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_.

(3)       Subsection 98(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_, as inserted by item 1 of this Schedule, does not apply in relation to a trustee of a trust in relation to an income year to which this item applies if the conditions in subitems (4) to (6) are satisfied for the trust for the income year.
