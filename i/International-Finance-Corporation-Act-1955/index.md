Suspension of Operations and Settlement of Obligations<lf> <lf> <p>  (a) The Corporation may permanently suspend its operations by vote of a majority of the Governors exercising a majority of the total voting power.

Such distribution shall be made at such times, in such currencies, and in cash or other assets as the Corporation shall deem fair and equitable. The shares distributed to the several members need not necessarily be uniform in respect of the type of assets distributed or of the currencies in which they are expressed.<lf> <lf>   (d) Any member receiving assets distributed by the Corporation pursuant to this Section shall enjoy the same rights with respect to such assets as the Corporation enjoyed prior to their distribution.<lf> <lf>                                   ARTICLE  VI<lf> <lf>                        Status, Immunities and Privileges<lf> Section 1\.
