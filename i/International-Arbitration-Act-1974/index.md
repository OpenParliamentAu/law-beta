                    <a name="arbitr-award"></a>**_arbitral award_** has the same meaning as in the Convention.

             (2)  In this Part, where the context so admits,**_enforcement_**, in relation to a foreign award, includes the recognition of the award as binding for any purpose, and **_enforce_** and **_enforced_** have corresponding meanings.

             (3)  For the purposes of this Part, a body corporate shall be taken to be ordinarily resident in a country if, and only if, it is incorporated or has its principal place of business in that country.

##### <a id="7"></a>7  Enforcement of foreign arbitration agreements

             (1)  Where:

                     (a)  the procedure in relation to arbitration under an arbitration agreement is governed, whether by virtue of the express terms of the agreement or otherwise, by the law of a Convention country;

                     (b)  the procedure in relation to arbitration under an arbitration agreement is governed, whether by virtue of the express terms of the agreement or otherwise, by the law of a country not being Australia or a Convention country, and a party to the agreement is Australia or a State or a person who was, at the time when the agreement was made, domiciled or ordinarily resident in Australia;

                     (c)  a party to an arbitration agreement is the Government of a Convention country or of part of a Convention country or the Government of a territory of a Convention country, being a territory to which the Convention extends; or

                     (d)  a party to an arbitration agreement is a person who was, at the time when the agreement was made, domiciled or ordinarily resident in a country that is a Convention country;

this section applies to the agreement.

             (2)  Subject to this Part, where:

                     (a)  proceedings instituted by a party to an arbitration agreement to which this section applies against another party to the agreement are pending in a court; and

                     (b)  the proceedings involve the determination of a matter that, in pursuance of the agreement, is capable of settlement by arbitration;

on the application of a party to the agreement, the court shall, by order, upon such conditions (if any) as it thinks fit, stay the proceedings or so much of the proceedings as involves the determination of that matter, as the case may be, and refer the parties to arbitration in respect of that matter.

             (3)  Where a court makes an order under subsection (2), it may, for the purpose of preserving the rights of the parties, make such interim or supplementary orders as it thinks fit in relation to any property that is the subject of the matter to which the first-mentioned order relates.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), a reference to a party includes a reference to a person claiming through or under a party.

             (5)  A court shall not make an order under subsection (2) if the court finds that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  Recognition of foreign awards

             (1)  Subject to this Part, a foreign award is binding by virtue of this Act for all purposes on the parties to the arbitration agreement in pursuance of which it was made.

             (2)  Subject to this Part, a foreign award may be enforced in a court of a State or Territory as if the award had been made in that State or Territory in accordance with the law of that State or Territory.

             (4)  Where:

                     (a)  at any time, a person seeks the enforcement of a foreign award by virtue of this Part; and

                     (b)  the country in which the award was made is not, at that time, a Convention country;

subsections (1) and (2) do not have effect in relation to the award unless that person is, at that time, domiciled or ordinarily resident in Australia or in a Convention country.

             (5)  Subject to subsection (6), in any proceedings in which the enforcement of a foreign award by virtue of this Part is sought, the court may, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, refuse to enforce the award if that party proves to the satisfaction of the court that:

                     (a)  that party, being a party to the arbitration agreement in pursuance of which the award was made, was, under the law applicable to him or her, under some incapacity at the time when the agreement was made;

                     (b)  the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law expressed in the agreement to be applicable to it or, where no law is so expressed to be applicable, under the law of the country where the award was made;

                     (c)  that party was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his or her case in the arbitration proceedings;

                     (d)  the award deals with a difference not contemplated by, or not falling within the terms of, the submission to arbitration, or contains a decision on a matter beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration;

                     (e)  the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or

                      (f)  the award has not yet become binding on the parties to the arbitration agreement or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, the award was made.

             (6)  Where an award to which paragraph (5)(d) applies contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration and those decisions can be separated from decisions on matters not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters so submitted may be enforced.

             (7)  In any proceedings in which the enforcement of a foreign award by virtue of this Part is sought, the court may refuse to enforce the award if it finds that:

                     (a)  the subject matter of the difference between the parties to the award is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the laws in force in the State or Territory in which the court is sitting; or

                     (b)  to enforce the award would be contrary to public policy.

             (8)  Where, in any proceedings in which the enforcement of a foreign award by virtue of this Part is sought, the court is satisfied that an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, the award was made, the court may, if it considers it proper to do so, adjourn the proceedings, or so much of the proceedings as relates to the award, as the case may be, and may also, on the application of the party claiming enforcement of the award, order the other party to give suitable security.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Evidence of awards and arbitration agreements

             (1)  In any proceedings in which a person seeks the enforcement of a foreign award by virtue of this Part, he or she shall produce to the court:

                     (a)  the duly authenticated original award or a duly certified copy; and

                     (b)  the original arbitration agreement under which the award purports to have been made or a duly certified copy.

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), an award shall be deemed to have been duly authenticated, and a copy of an award or agreement shall be deemed to have been duly certified, if:

                     (a)  it purports to have been authenticated or certified, as the case may be, by the arbitrator or, where the arbitrator is a tribunal, by an officer of that tribunal, and it has not been shown to the court that it was not in fact so authenticated or certified; or

                     (b)  it has been otherwise authenticated or certified to the satisfaction of the court.

             (3)  If a document or part of a document produced under subsection (1) is written in a language other than English, there shall be produced with the document a translation, in the English language, of the document or that part, as the case may be, certified to be a correct translation.

             (4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), a translation shall be certified by a diplomatic or consular agent in Australia of the country in which the award was made or otherwise to the satisfaction of the court.

             (5)  A document produced to a court in accordance with this section is, upon mere production, receivable by the court as _prima facie_ evidence of the matters to which it relates.

##### <a id="10"></a>10  Evidence relating to Convention

             (1)  For the purposes of this Part, a certificate purporting to be signed by the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and stating that a country specified in the certificate is, or was at a time so specified, a Convention country is, upon mere production, receivable in any proceedings as _prima facie_ evidence of that fact.

             (2)  For the purposes of this Part, a copy of the _Gazette_ containing a Proclamation fixing a date under subsection 2(2) is, upon mere production, receivable in any proceedings as _prima facie_ evidence of:

                     (a)  the fact that Australia has acceded to the Convention; and

                     (b)  the fact that the Convention entered into force for Australia on or before the date so fixed.

##### <a id="10A"></a>10A  Delegation by Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

             (1)  The Secretary may, either generally or as otherwise provided by the instrument of delegation, in writing, delegate to the person occupying a specified office in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade all or any of the Secretary’s powers under subsection 10(1).

             (2)  A power delegated under subsection (1) shall, when exercised by the delegate, be deemed to have been exercised by the Secretary.

             (3)  The delegate is, in the exercise of a power delegated under subsection (1), subject to the directions of the Secretary.

             (4)  The delegation of a power under subsection (1) does not prevent the exercise of the power by the Secretary.

             (5)  In this section, **_Secretary_** means the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

##### <a id="12"></a>12  Effect of this Part on other laws

             (1)  This Part applies to the exclusion of any provisions made by a law of a State or Territory with respect to the recognition of arbitration agreements and the enforcement of foreign awards, being provisions that operate in whole or in part by reference to the Convention.

             (2)  Except as provided in subsection (1), nothing in this Part affects the right of any person to the enforcement of a foreign award otherwise than in pursuance of this Act.

##### <a id="13"></a>13  Judiciary Act

                   A matter arising under this Part, including a question of interpretation of the Convention for the purposes of this Act, shall, for the purposes of section 38 of the _Judiciary Act 1903-1973_, be deemed not to be a matter arising directly under a treaty.

##### <a id="14"></a>14  Application of Part

                   The application of this Part extends to agreements and awards made before the date fixed under subsection 2(2), including agreements and awards made before the day referred to in subsection 2(1).

## Part III—International Commercial Arbitration

### Division 1—Preliminary

##### <a id="15"></a>15  Interpretation

             (1)  In this Part:

                    <a name="model-law"></a>**_Model Law_** means the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on 21 June 1985, the English text of which is set out in Schedule 2.

             (2)  Except so far as the contrary intention appears, a word or expression that is used both in this Part and in the Model Law (whether or not a particular meaning is given to it by the Model Law) has, in this Part, the same meaning as it has in the Model Law.

### Division 2—Model Law

##### <a id="16"></a>16  Model Law to have force of law

             (1)  Subject to this Part, the Model Law has the force of law in Australia.

             (2)  In the Model Law:

                    <a name="state"></a>**_State_** means Australia (including the external Territories) and any foreign country.

                    <a name="state"></a>**_this State_** means Australia (including the external Territories).

##### <a id="17"></a>17  Interpretation of Model Law—use of extrinsic material

             (1)  For the purposes of interpreting the Model Law, reference may be made to the documents of:

                     (a)  the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law; and

                     (b)  its working group for the preparation of the Model Law;

relating to the Model Law.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not affect the application of section 15AB of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ for the purposes of interpreting this Part.

##### <a id="18"></a>18  Courts specified for purposes of Article 6 of Model Law

The following courts shall be taken to have been specified in Article 6 of the Model Law as courts competent to perform the functions referred to in that article:

                     (a)  if the place of arbitration is, or is to be, in a State—the Supreme Court of that State;

                     (b)  if the place of arbitration is, or is to be, in a Territory:

                              (i)  the Supreme Court of that Territory; or

                             (ii)  if there is no Supreme Court established in that Territory—the Supreme Court of the State or Territory that has jurisdiction in relation to that Territory.

##### <a id="19"></a>19  Articles 34 and 36 of Model Law—public policy

                   Without limiting the generality of subparagraphs 34(2)(b)(ii) and 36(1)(b)(ii) of the Model Law, it is hereby declared, for the avoidance of any doubt, that, for the purposes of those subparagraphs, an award is in conflict with the public policy of Australia if:

                     (a)  the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption; or

                     (b)  a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award.

##### <a id="20"></a>20  Chapter VIII of Model Law not to apply in certain cases

                   Where, but for this section, both Chapter VIII of the Model Law and Part II of this Act would apply in relation to an award, Chapter VIII of the Model Law does not apply in relation to the award.

##### <a id="21"></a>21  Settlement of dispute otherwise than in accordance with Model Law

                   If the parties to an arbitration agreement have (whether in the agreement or in any other document in writing) agreed that any dispute that has arisen or may arise between them is to be settled otherwise than in accordance with the Model Law, the Model Law does not apply in relation to the settlement of that dispute.

### Division 3—Optional provisions

##### <a id="22"></a>22  Application of optional provisions

                   If the parties to an arbitration agreement have (whether in the agreement or in any other document in writing) agreed that the other provisions, or any of the other provisions, of this Division are to apply in relation to the settlement of any dispute (being a dispute that is to be settled in accordance with the Model Law) that has arisen or may arise between them, those provisions apply in relation to the settlement of that dispute.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Orders under Article 17 of the Model Law

                   Chapter VIII of the Model Law applies to orders by an arbitral tribunal under Article 17 of the Model Law requiring a party:

                     (a)  to take an interim measure of protection; or

                     (b)  to provide security in connection with such a measure;

as if any reference in that chapter to an arbitral award or an award were a reference to such an order.

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Consolidation of arbitral proceedings

             (1)  A party to arbitral proceedings before an arbitral tribunal may apply to the tribunal for an order under this section in relation to those proceedings and other arbitral proceedings (whether before that tribunal or another tribunal or other tribunals) on the ground that:

                     (a)  a common question of law or fact arises in all those proceedings;

                     (b)  the rights to relief claimed in all those proceedings are in respect of, or arise out of, the same transaction or series of transactions; or

                     (c)  for some other reason specified in the application, it is desirable that an order be made under this section.

             (2)  The following orders may be made under this section in relation to 2 or more arbitral proceedings:

                     (a)  that the proceedings be consolidated on terms specified in the order;

                     (b)  that the proceedings be heard at the same time or in a sequence specified in the order;

                     (c)  that any of the proceedings be stayed pending the determination of any other of the proceedings.

             (3)  Where an application has been made under subsection (1) in relation to 2 or more arbitral proceedings (in this section called the **_related proceedings_**), the following provisions have effect.

             (4)  If all the related proceedings are being heard by the same tribunal, the tribunal may make such order under this section as it thinks fit in relation to those proceedings and, if such an order is made, the proceedings shall be dealt with in accordance with the order.

             (5)  If 2 or more arbitral tribunals are hearing the related proceedings:

                     (a)  the tribunal that received the application shall communicate the substance of the application to the other tribunals concerned; and

                     (b)  the tribunals shall, as soon as practicable, deliberate jointly on the application.

             (6)  Where the tribunals agree, after deliberation on the application, that a particular order under this section should be made in relation to the related proceedings:

                     (a)  the tribunals shall jointly make the order;

                     (b)  the related proceedings shall be dealt with in accordance with the order; and

                     (c)  if the order is that the related proceedings be consolidated—the arbitrator or arbitrators for the purposes of the consolidated proceedings shall be appointed, in accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of the Model Law, from the members of the tribunals.

             (7)  If the tribunals are unable to make an order under subsection (6), the related proceedings shall proceed as if no application has been made under subsection (1).

             (8)  This section does not prevent the parties to related proceedings from agreeing to consolidate them and taking such steps as are necessary to effect that consolidation.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Interest up to making of award

             (1)  Unless the parties to an arbitration agreement have (whether in the agreement or in any other document in writing) otherwise agreed, where an arbitral tribunal determines to make an award for the payment of money (whether on a claim for a liquidated or an unliquidated amount), the tribunal may, subject to subsection (2), include in the sum for which the award is made interest, at such reasonable rate as the tribunal determines on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made.

             (2)  Subsection (1) does not:

                     (a)  authorise the awarding of interest upon interest;

                     (b)  apply in relation to any amount upon which interest is payable as of right whether by virtue of an agreement or otherwise; or

                     (c)  affect the damages recoverable for the dishonour of a bill of exchange.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Interest on debt under award

                   Unless the parties to an arbitration agreement have (whether in the agreement or in any other document in writing) otherwise agreed, where an arbitral tribunal makes an award for the payment of money, the tribunal may direct that interest, at such reasonable rate as the tribunal determines, is payable, from the day of the making of the award or such later day as the tribunal specifies, on so much of the money as is from time to time unpaid and any interest that so accrues shall be deemed to form part of the award.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Costs

             (1)  Unless the parties to an arbitration agreement have (whether in the agreement or in any other document in writing) otherwise agreed, the costs of an arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator or arbitrators) shall be in the discretion of the arbitral tribunal.

             (2)  An arbitral tribunal may in making an award:

                     (a)  direct to whom, by whom, and in what manner, the whole or any part of the costs that it awards shall be paid;

                     (b)  tax or settle the amount of costs to be so paid or any part of those costs; and

                     (c)  award costs to be taxed or settled as between party and party or as between solicitor and client.

             (3)  Any costs of an arbitration (other than the fees or expenses of an arbitrator) that are directed to be paid by an award are, to the extent that they have not been taxed or settled by the arbitral tribunal, taxable in the Court having jurisdiction under Article 34 of the Model Law to hear applications for setting aside the award.

             (4)  If no provision is made by an award with respect to the costs of the arbitration, a party to the arbitration agreement may, within 14 days after receiving the award, apply to the arbitral tribunal for directions as to the payment of those costs, and thereupon the tribunal shall, after hearing any party who wishes to be heard, amend the award by adding to it such directions as the tribunal thinks proper with respect to the payment of the costs of the arbitration.

### Division 4—Miscellaneous

##### <a id="28"></a>28  Liability of arbitrator

                   An arbitrator is not liable for negligence in respect of anything done or omitted to be done in the capacity of arbitrator, but is liable for fraud in respect of anything done or omitted to be done in that capacity.

##### <a id="29"></a>29  Representation in proceedings

             (1)  Where, in accordance with the Model Law, with the agreement of the parties or at the request of a party, as the case may be, the arbitral tribunal holds oral hearings for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or conducts proceedings on the basis of documents or other materials, the following provisions shall, without prejudice to the Model Law, apply.

# Schedule 1—United Nations Conference on International Commercial Arbitration Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards

Section 3 

ARTICLE I

1.  This Convention shall apply to the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards made in the territory of a State other than the State where the recognition and enforcement of such awards are sought, and arising out of differences between persons, whether physical or legal. It shall also apply to arbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the State where their recognition and enforcement are sought.

2.  The term “arbitral awards” shall include not only awards made by arbitrators appointed for each case but also those made by permanent arbitral bodies to which the parties have submitted.

3.  When signing, ratifying or acceding to this Convention, or notifying extensions under article X hereof, any State may on the basis of reciprocity declare that it will apply the Convention to the recognition and enforcement of awards made only in the territory of another Contracting State. It may also declare that it will apply the Convention only to differences arising out of legal relationships, whether contractual or not, which are considered as commercial under the national law of the State making such declaration. 

ARTICLE II

1.  Each Contracting State shall recognize an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not, concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration.

2.  The term “agreement in writing” shall include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams.

3.  The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.

ARTICLE III 

Each   Contracting State shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon, under the conditions laid down in the following articles. There shall not be imposed substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this Convention applies than are imposed on the recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards.

ARTICLE IV

1.  To obtain the recognition and enforcement mentioned in the preceding article, the party applying for recognition and enforcement shall, at the time of the application, supply:

(a)   The duly authenticated original award or a duly certified copy thereof;

(b)   The original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof.

2.  If the said award or agreement is not made in an official language of the country in which the award is relied upon, the party applying for recognition and enforcement of the award shall produce a translation of these documents into such language. The translation shall be certified by an official or sworn translator or by a diplomatic or consular agent.

ARTICLE V

1.  Recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof that: 

(a)   The parties to the agreement referred to in article II were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or

(b)   The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or

(c)   The award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced; or

(d)   The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or

(e)   The award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made.

2.  Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that:

(a)   The subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of that country; or

(b)   The recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country. 

ARTICLE VI

If an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority referred to in article V (1) (e), the authority before which the award is sought to be relied upon may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award and may also, on the application of the party claiming enforcement of the award, order the other party to give suitable security.

ARTICLE VII

1.  The provisions of the present Convention shall not affect the validity of multilateral or bilateral agreements concerning the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards entered into by the Contracting States nor deprive any interested party of any right he may have to avail himself of an arbitral award in the manner and to the extent allowed by the law or the treaties of the country where such award is sought to be relied upon.

2.  The Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses of 1923 and the Geneva Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1927 shall cease to have effect between Contracting States on their becoming bound and to the extent that they become bound, by this Convention.

(c)   A federal State party to this Convention shall, at the request of any other Contracting State transmitted through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, supply a statement of the law and practice of the federation and its constituent units in regard to any particular provision of this Convention, showing the extent to which effect has been given to that provision by legislative or other action.

(2)   The provisions of this Law, except articles 8, 9, 35 and 36, apply only if the place of arbitration is in the territory of this State.

(c)   the parties have expressly agreed that the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement relates to more than one country.

(4)   For the purposes of paragraph (3) of this article:

(a)   if a party has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the arbitration agreement;

(b)   if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to his habitual residence.

(5)   This Law shall not affect any other law of this State by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration or may be submitted to arbitration only according to provisions other than those of this Law.

Article 2\. _Definitions and rules of interpretation_

For the purposes of this Law:

(a)   “arbitration” means any arbitration whether or not administered by a permanent arbitral institution;

(b)   “arbitral tribunal” means a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators;

(c)   “court” means a body or organ of the judicial system of a State;

(d)   where a provision of this Law, except article 28, leaves the parties free to determine a certain issue, such freedom includes the right of the parties to authorize a third party, including an institution, to make that determination;

(e)   where a provision of this Law refers to the fact that the parties have agreed or that they may agree or in any other way refers to an agreement of the parties, such agreement includes any arbitration rules referred to in that agreement;

(f)    where a provision of this Law, other than in articles 25 (a) and 32 (2) (a), refers to a claim, it also applies to a counter-claim, and where it refers to a defence, it also applies to a defence to such counter-claim.

Article 3\. _Receipt of written communications_

CHAPTER II. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

Article 7\. _Definition and form of arbitration agreement_

(1)   “Arbitration agreement” is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not. An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.

(2)   The arbitration agreement shall be in writing. An agreement is in writing if it is contained in a document signed by the parties or in an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which provide a record of the agreement, or in an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by another. The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement provided that the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.

Article 8\. _Arbitration agreement and substantive claim before court_

(1)   A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.

(2)   Where an action referred to in paragraph (1) of this article has been brought, arbitral proceedings may nevertheless be commenced or continued, and an award may be made, while the issue is pending before the court.

Article 9\. _Arbitration agreement and interim measures by court_

It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request, before or during arbitral proceedings, from a court an interim measure of protection and for a court to grant such measure.

CHAPTER III. COMPOSITION OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Article 10\. _Number of arbitrators_

(1)   The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators.

(2)   Failing such determination, the number of arbitrators shall be three.

Article 11\. _Appointment of arbitrators_

(1)   No person shall be precluded by reason of his nationality from acting as an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. 

(2)   The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (4) and (5) of this article.

(3)   Failing such agreement,

(a)   in an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator; if a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within thirty days of receipt of a request to do so from the other party, or if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty days of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the court or other authority specified in article 6;

(b)   in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, he shall be appointed, upon request of a party, by the court or other authority specified in article 6.

(4)   Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,

(a)   a party fails to act as required under such procedure, or

(b)   the parties, or two arbitrators, are unable to reach an agreement expected of them under such procedure, or

(c)   a third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to it under such procedure,

any party may request the court or other authority specified in article 6 to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.

(5)   A decision on a matter entrusted by paragraph (3) or (4) of this article to the court or other authority specified in article 6 shall be subject to no appeal. The court or other authority, in appointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to any qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator and, in the case of a sole or third arbitrator, shall take into account as well the advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than those of the parties.

Article 12\. _Grounds for challenge_

(1)   When a person is approached in connection with his possible appointment as an arbitrator, he shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence. An arbitrator, from the time of his appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, shall without delay disclose any such circumstances to the parties unless they have already been informed of them by him.

(2)   An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence, or if he does not possess qualifications agreed to by the parties. A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by him, or in whose appointment he has participated, only for reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment has been made.

Article 13\. _Challenge procedure_

(1)   The parties are free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this article.

(2)   Failing such agreement, a party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within fifteen days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any circumstance referred to in article 12 (2), send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. Unless the challenged arbitrator withdraws from his office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge.

(3)   If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure of paragraph (2) of this article is not successful, the challenging party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of the decision rejecting the challenge, the court or other authority specified in article 6 to decide on the challenge, which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal, including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.

Article 14\. _Failure or impossibility to act_

(1)   If an arbitrator becomes _de jure_ or _de facto_ unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, his mandate terminates if he withdraws from his office or if the parties agree on the termination. Otherwise, if a controversy remains concerning any of these grounds, any party may request the court or other authority specified in article 6 to decide on the termination of the mandate, which decision shall be subject to no appeal.

(2)   If, under this article or article 13 (2), an arbitrator withdraws from his office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, this does not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this article or article 12 (2).

Article 15\. _Appointment of substitute arbitrator_

Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates under article 13 or 14 or because of his withdrawal from office for any other reason or because of the revocation of his mandate by agreement of the parties or in any other case of termination of his mandate, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced.

CHAPTER IV. JURISDICTION OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Article 16\. _Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction_

(1)   The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail _ipso jure_ the invalidity of the arbitration clause.

(2)   A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence. A party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal may, in either case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.

(3)   The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph (2) of this article either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of that ruling, the court specified in article 6 to decide the matter, which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.

Article 17\. _Power of arbitral tribunal to order interim measures_

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, order any party to take such interim measure of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute. The arbitral tribunal may require any party to provide appropriate security in connection with such measure.

CHAPTER V. CONDUCT OF ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS

Article 18\. _Equal treatment of parties_

The parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given a full opportunity of presenting his case.

Article 19\. _Determination of rules of procedure_

(1)   Subject to the provisions of this Law, the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting the proceedings.

(2)   Failing such agreement, the arbitral tribunal may, subject to the provisions of this Law, conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate. The power conferred upon the arbitral tribunal includes the power to determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.

Article 20\. _Place of arbitration_

(1)   The parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. Failing such agreement, the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this article, the arbitral tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of goods, other property or documents.

Article 21\. _Commencement of arbitral proceedings_

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.

Article 22\. _Language_

(1)   The parties are free to agree on the language or languages to be used in the arbitral proceedings. Failing such agreement, the arbitral tribunal shall determine the language or languages to be used in the proceedings. This agreement or determination, unless otherwise specified therein, shall apply to any written statement by a party, any hearing and any award, decision or other communication by the arbitral tribunal.

(2)   The arbitral tribunal may order that any documentary evidence shall be accompanied by a translation into the language or languages agreed upon by the parties or determined by the arbitral tribunal.

Article 23\. _Statements of claim and defence_

(1)   Within the period of time agreed by the parties or determined by the arbitral tribunal, the claimant shall state the facts supporting his claim, the points at issue and the relief or remedy sought, and the respondent shall state his defence in respect of these particulars, unless the parties have otherwise agreed as to the required elements of such statements. The parties may submit with their statements all documents they consider to be relevant or may add a reference to the documents or other evidence they will submit.

(2)   Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or supplement his claim or defence during the course of the arbitral proceedings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it.

Article 24\. _Hearings and written proceedings_

(1)   Subject to any contrary agreement by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall decide whether to hold oral hearings for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the proceedings shall be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials.

If the arbitral tribunal considers the request to be justified, it shall make the correction or give the interpretation within thirty days of receipt of the request. The interpretation shall form part of the award.

(2)   The arbitral tribunal may correct any error of the type referred to in paragraph (1) (a) of this article on its own initiative within thirty days of the date of the award.

Before rendering an award, the Tribunal shall notify, and grant a period of grace to, the party failing to appear or to present its case, unless it is satisfied that that party does not intend to do so.

_Article 46_

_Article 51_ 

(1)   Either party may request revision of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on the ground of discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant’s ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.

(2)   The application shall be made within 90 days after the discovery of such fact and in any event within three years after the date on which the award was rendered.

(3)   The request shall, if possible, be submitted to the Tribunal which rendered the award. If this shall not be possible, a new Tribunal shall be constituted in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter.

(4)   The Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Tribunal rules on such request.

(b)   that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;

(c)   that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;

(d)   that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or

(e)   that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.

(2)   The application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered except that when annulment is requested on the ground of corruption such application shall be made within 120 days after discovery of the corruption and in any event within three years after the date on which the award was rendered.

_Article 54_

(1)   Each   Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.

(2)   A party seeking recognition or enforcement in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation.

(3)   Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.

_Article 56_

(1)   After a Commission or a Tribunal has been constituted and proceedings have begun, its composition shall remain unchanged; provided, however, that if a conciliator or an arbitrator should die, become incapacitated, or resign, the resulting vacancy shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of Chapter III or Section 2 of Chapter IV.

(2)   A member of a Commission or Tribunal shall continue to serve in that capacity notwithstanding that he shall have ceased to be a member of the Panel.

(3)   If a conciliator or arbitrator appointed by a party shall have resigned without the consent of the Commission or Tribunal of which he was a member, the Chairman shall appoint a person from the appropriate Panel to fill the resulting vacancy.

_Article 57_

A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.

_Article 58_

The decision on any proposal to disqualify a conciliator or arbitrator shall be taken by the other members of the Commission or Tribunal as the case may be, provided that where those members are equally divided, or in the case of a proposal to disqualify a sole conciliator or arbitrator, or a majority of the conciliators or arbitrators, the Chairman shall take that decision. If it is decided that the proposal is well-founded the conciliator or arbitrator to whom the decision relates shall be replaced in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of Chapter III or Section 2 of Chapter IV.

Such decision shall form part of the award.

CHAPTER VII
