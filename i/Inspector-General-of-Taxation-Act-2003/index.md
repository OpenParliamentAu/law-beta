However, it does not include rules imposing or creating an obligation to pay an amount under a tax law, or rules dealing with the quantification of such an amount.

##### <a id="8"></a>8  When a review may be conducted

             (1)  The Inspector‑General may conduct a review on his or her own initiative.

Note:          For example, the Inspector‑General may conduct a review on a matter that has been drawn to his or her attention by taxpayers, tax professionals or the Commonwealth Ombudsman.

             (2)  The Inspector‑General may be directed, in writing, by the Minister to conduct a review. On receipt of a direction, the Inspector‑General must include the review in his or her work program under section 9.

Note:          Under section 9, the Inspector‑General has discretion in deciding how to include the review in the work program (including, for example, what priority to give the review).

                     (a)  the Minister; or

                     (b)  the Commissioner of Taxation; or

                     (d)  a resolution of a Committee of either House, or of both Houses, of the Parliament.

However, the Inspector‑General is not required to comply with the request.

##### <a id="9"></a>9  Setting the Inspector‑General’s work program

             (1)  The Inspector‑General has discretion in setting his or her work program (subject to subsection 8(2) and subsection (2) of this section).

             (2)  For the purposes of subsection (1):

                     (a)  the **_general publication deadline_** is the end of 25 sitting days of each House of the Parliament, calculated starting from the day after the day on which the Minister receives the report; and

                     (b)  the **_extended publication deadline_** is the end of 25 sitting days of each House of the Parliament, calculated starting from the day after the day on which the period referred to in paragraph (1)(b) ends.

Note:          If, because of differences in the days on which the two Houses sit, the 25 sitting day period for the two Houses ends on different days, the relevant deadline is the end of the later of those days.

##### <a id="23"></a>23  Taxpayer information

Reports not to include information relating to a taxpayer’s affairs

             (1)  Information relating to a particular taxpayer’s affairs must not be included in a report under section 10 or 41 if:

                     (a)  the taxpayer is named, or otherwise specifically identified, in the report as the taxpayer to whom the information relates; or

                     (b)  it is reasonably likely that people generally (other than people to whom the taxpayer has disclosed information relating to the taxpayer’s affairs) would be able to work out the identity of the taxpayer to whom the information relates.

Submissions not to be made available if they include information relating to a taxpayer’s affairs

             (2)  A submission, or a record of a submission, that contains information relating to a particular taxpayer’s affairs must not be made available under subsection 13(3) if:

                     (a)  the taxpayer is named, or otherwise specifically identified, in the submission or record as the taxpayer to whom the information relates; or

                     (b)  it is reasonably likely that people to whom the submission or record is proposed to be made available (other than people to whom the taxpayer has disclosed information relating to the taxpayer’s affairs) would be able to work out the identity of the taxpayer to whom the information relates.

Note:          This subsection applies even when the information relates to the submission‑maker’s own affairs.

Matters to be taken into account in “reasonably likely” test

             (3)  For the purposes of applying paragraphs (1)(b) and (2)(b) to information relating to a particular taxpayer’s affairs, the context in which the information appears, and information that is otherwise publicly available, must be taken into account (as well as any other relevant matter).

##### <a id="24"></a>24  Identifying tax officials

Reports generally not to name tax officials

             (1)  A report under section 10 or 41 must not name, or otherwise specifically identify, a particular tax official, other than the Commissioner of Taxation, as being a person whose conduct has been considered in the course of a review.

Submissions not to be made available if they name tax officials

             (2)  A submission, or a record of a submission, must not be made available under subsection 13(3) if it names, or otherwise specifically identifies, a particular tax official, other than the Commissioner of Taxation.

However this does not apply to references to parts of the ATO

             (3)  For the purposes of this section, merely naming, or otherwise specifically identifying, a part of the Australian Taxation Office does not constitute naming or identifying a particular tax official.

##### <a id="25"></a>25  Criticising the ATO or tax officials

Proposal to include criticism of the ATO or tax officials in a report

             (1)  This section applies if it is proposed to include in a report under section 10 or 41 material that is expressly or impliedly critical of:

                     (a)  the Australian Taxation Office or a part of the Australian Taxation Office; or

                     (b)  a tax official or a group of tax officials.

Commissioner to be given opportunity to make submissions

             (2)  The material must not be included in the report unless the Inspector‑General has given the Commissioner of Taxation, or a person authorised in writing  by the Commissioner, a reasonable opportunity to make submissions to the Inspector‑General in relation to the subject of the criticism.

Note:          Compliance with this subsection for the purposes of including material in a report under section 10 also counts as compliance for the purposes of including substantially the same material in a report under section 41.

How submissions may be made

             (3)  The Commissioner or the authorised person may choose to make either or both written or oral submissions.

             (4)  If the Commissioner or the authorised person chooses to make oral submissions, the Commissioner or authorised person may:

                     (a)  make the submissions personally; or

                     (b)  choose another person to make the submissions on the Commissioner’s or authorised person’s behalf (whether or not the Commissioner or authorised person is present during those submissions).

Protection from liability for people making submissions

             (5)  A person who, in good faith, makes a submission under this section is not liable:

                     (a)  to any proceedings for contravening any other law because of that conduct; or

                     (b)  to civil proceedings for loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person because of that conduct.

No loss of legal professional privilege

             (6)  Information or a document does not cease to be the subject of legal professional privilege merely because it is included or referred to in a submission made under this section.

##### <a id="26"></a>26  Confidential submissions

Confidential submissions not to be made available or reported

             (1)  If a person who makes a submission under section 13 has told the Inspector‑General, or a member of the Inspector‑General’s staff, that the submission is to be kept confidential, then:

                     (a)  the submission, or a record of the submission, must not be made available under subsection 13(3); and

                     (b)  information contained in the submission must not be included in a report under section 10 or 41.

Restriction does not apply if same information is obtained by other means

             (2)  However, paragraph (1)(b) does not prevent the inclusion in a report of information contained in a submission if the same information has also been obtained by the Inspector‑General, or a member of the Inspector‑General’s staff, by other means.

##### <a id="27"></a>27  Legal professional privilege

Reports not to include privileged information or documents

             (1)  Information or a document:

                     (a)  that has been given or produced to the Inspector‑General, or a member of the Inspector‑General’s staff, under section 14, 15 or 25; and

                     (b)  that is:

                              (i)  the subject of legal professional privilege; or

                             (ii)  derived from information or a document that is the subject of legal professional privilege;

must not be included in a report under section 10 or 41.

Limited power to refer in reports to privileged legal advice

             (2)  Despite subsection (1), a report may include a statement:

                     (a)  to the effect that legal advice (being advice contained in information or a document that was given or produced as referred to in paragraph (1)(a)) was considered in the course of the review; and

                     (b)  outlining, in general terms, the relevance of that advice, or of any aspect of it, to the review.

However, in doing so, the other provisions of this Division must still be complied with.

Subsection (2) does not otherwise affect privilege

             (3)  If a report includes a statement relating to legal advice as referred to in subsection (2), the advice does not cease to be the subject of legal professional privilege merely because:

                     (a)  the report includes that statement; or

                     (b)  the report is given to the Minister; or

                     (c)  the report, or any part of it, is tabled or otherwise made publicly available by the Minister.
