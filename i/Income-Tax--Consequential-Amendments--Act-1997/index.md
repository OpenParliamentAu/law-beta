 170-5  Basic principles for transferring tax losses

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A transferring corporation (within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_) can transfer a

tax loss to a receiving corporation (within the meaning of that Act) so that

the receiving corporation can deduct it.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The corporations must be related in such a way that that Act would apply to a transfer of assets from the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>The receiving corporation need not have enough assessable income to offset the transferred tax loss.</dd> <dt>(4)</dt><dd>The tax loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2 corporations.  </dd> </dl>

Effect of transferring a tax loss
 170-10  When a corporation can transfer a tax loss

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A transferring corporation within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ (the _loss company_) can transfer an amount of its <sup>*</sup>tax loss for an

income year of the loss company (the _loss year_) to a receiving

corporation within the meaning of that Act (the _income company_)

if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the <sup>*</sup>tax loss. </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	A PDF cannot transfer a tax loss, except one for a period

before it became a PDF: see section 195-10.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(3)</dt><dd>However, the <sup>*</sup>loss company cannot transfer so much of the

<sup>*</sup>tax loss as the loss company has deducted, or can deduct, for an

income year before the one in which the amount is transferred.

</dd> </dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

170-15  Income company is taken to have incurred transferred loss

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If an amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss is transferred, the

<sup>*</sup>amount is taken to be a tax loss incurred by the <sup>*</sup>income

company in the <sup>*</sup>loss year.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>However, if the <sup>*</sup>loss year is the same as the income year of the <sup>*</sup>income company for which the amount is transferred (the _transfer year_), the <sup>*</sup>income company is taken to have incurred the <sup>*</sup>tax loss in the income year before the loss year. </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	This rule is needed because Division 36 allows a tax loss

to be deducted only if it was incurred in an _earlier_ income year.

 </dl></dl>

170-20  Who can deduct transferred loss

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If an amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss is transferred, the

<sup>*</sup>income company can deduct the amount in accordance with section

36-15 (which is about how to deduct a tax loss), but only if Subdivision 165-A

(as modified by section 170-23) and Subdivision 175-A do not prevent it from

doing so.

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Subdivision 165-A is about the conditions that a company

needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year. 	Subdivision 175-A is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax losses.  </dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>loss company can no longer deduct the transferred amount

and is taken not to have incurred the <sup>*</sup>tax loss to the extent of

that amount.

</dd> </dl>

170-23  When income company must maintain same owners and control

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>Ordinarily, Subdivision 165-A prevents a company from deducting for an

income year (the _deduction year_) a tax loss if there has been a

change in the ownership or control of the company between the _loss year_

and the deduction year.

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	Subdivision 165-A is about the conditions that a company

needs to satisfy before it can deduct a tax loss from an earlier income year.

 </dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>However, subsection (3) modifies that Subdivision so that the

<sup>*</sup>income company is prevented from deducting for the deduction year a

transferred amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss only if there has been a change in

ownership or control in the income company between the _transfer year_ and

the deduction year.</dd> <dt>(3)</dt><dd>That Subdivision applies to the transferred amount as if all references to "<sup>*</sup>loss year" in that Subdivision were references to "<sup>*</sup>transfer year". </dd> </dl>

170-25  Tax treatment of payment for transferred tax loss

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>A payment received for an amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss is neither

assessable income nor exempt income of the <sup>*</sup>loss company.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>income company cannot deduct a payment it makes for an amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss. </dd> </dl>

Conditions for transfer
 170-28  Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 must apply to asset transfer from loss company to income company

<dl compact="">

		If it were assumed that:

 </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>an asset (within the meaning of the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993)_ had been transferred by the

<sup>*</sup>loss company to the <sup>*</sup>income company on the last day of a

particular income year of the <sup>*</sup>loss company (the _notional transfer year_); and </dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied

in relation to that transfer;

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<center>Back to Top</center>

then it must be the case that that Act would have applied to that transfer.

170-32  The loss year

<dl compact="">

		The <sup>*</sup>loss year must be either:

 </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>the income year in which the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ commenced; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>an earlier income year.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

170-33  The transfer year

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The <sup>*</sup>transfer year must either:

</dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>end at the end of the <sup>*</sup>notional transfer year; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>correspond to the income year of the <sup>*</sup>loss company that next

follows the <sup>*</sup>notional transfer year.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact="">

<dt>(2)</dt><dd>Also, the <sup>*</sup>transfer year must be one of the 5 income years

after the  income year in which the _Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993_ commenced.

</dd> </dl>

170-35  The loss company

<dl compact="">

		If the <sup>*</sup>loss year and the <sup>*</sup>transfer year are the same,

it must be the case that the <sup>*</sup>loss company was _not_ required

to calculate the <sup>*</sup>tax loss under section 165-70 or 175-35.

 </dl>

170-50  Transfer by written agreement

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>The transfer must be made by a written agreement

between the <sup>*</sup>loss company and the <sup>*</sup>income company.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>The agreement must: </dd> </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>specify the <sup>*</sup>transfer year (which may be earlier than the

income year in which the agreement is made); and</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>specify the amount of the <sup>*</sup>tax loss being transferred; and</dd>

<dt>(c)</dt><dd>be signed by the public officer of each company; and</dd>

<dt>(d)</dt><dd>be made on or before the day of lodgment of the <sup>*</sup>income

company's <sup>*</sup>income tax return for the <sup>*</sup>transfer year, or

within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact="">

Note:	The agreement will usually be made in the next income year

_after_ the one in which the tax loss is transferred.

 </dl></dl>

170-55  Losses must be transferred in order they are incurred

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If the <sup>*</sup>loss company has 2 or more <sup>*</sup>tax losses

(other than <sup>*</sup>film losses) that it can transfer in the

<sup>*</sup>transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it

incurred them.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>If the <sup>*</sup>loss company has 2 or more <sup>*</sup>film losses that it can transfer in the <sup>*</sup>transfer year, it can transfer them only in the order in which it incurred them. </dd> </dl>

170-60  Income company cannot transfer transferred tax loss

<dl compact="">

		The <sup>*</sup>income company cannot transfer an amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax

loss transferred to it, or any part of the amount.

 </dl>

Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred
 170-65  Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred

<dl compact="">

<dt>(1)</dt><dd>If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum amount that

the <sup>*</sup>loss company can transfer to the <sup>*</sup>income company in

the <sup>*</sup>transfer year, only that maximum amount is taken to have been

transferred.</dd> <dt>(2)</dt><dd>One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the agreement. </dd> </dl>

170-70  Amendment of assessments

<dl compact="">

		The Commissioner may amend an assessment to disallow a deduction for a

transferred amount of a <sup>*</sup>tax loss:

 </dl>

<dl compact=""><dl compact=""><dl compact="">

<dt>(a)</dt><dd>if the agreement to transfer the tax loss is ineffective because the

<sup>*</sup>loss company did not actually incur the loss; or</dd>

<dt>(b)</dt><dd>to the extent that section 170-65 reduces the transferred amount of a tax

loss because the loss company did not actually incur some of it.

</dd>

</dl></dl></dl>

The Commissioner may do so despite section 170 (Amendment of assessments) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_.
